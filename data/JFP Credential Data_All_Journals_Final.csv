Seeking Nirvana Amidst Chaos,"Buddhism teaches that the only constant in life is change. The last year is a testament to that. Despite how well some people felt they had everything in order, the pandemic showed us that you need to always be ready for disruptions. That alone has changed the entire nature of work for many, including financial planners. There are many challenges, and opportunities, that financial planners will face going forward, and embracing technology will play a central role. A demographic shift is coming as Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, are rapidly becoming the generation to focus on. Today, Millennials range from ages 25 to 40. There has been a sharp rise of fee-only advisers, and for good reason. There is a poignant distrust of the financial industry as Millennials have lived through two ""once-in-a-lifetime"" recessions.","Cummings, Bridger", Feature,Dec,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Millennials , Financial planners , Financial planning",ProQuest One Academic
Tax Considerations for Relatively Wealthy Households,"Reichenstein talks about households whose income places them beyond the end of the tax torpedo, which is where they pay taxes on 85 percent of their Social Security benefits, which is the maximum. He will call these ""relatively wealthy households."" These households should be concerned with how their saving decisions will impact the levels of their Medicare premiums in their retirement years.

Establishing Financial Self-efficacy Among African American Students,"A financial literacy gap exists between African American students and their White peers. According to Huston (2010), financial literacy comprises three components: objective financial knowledge (knowledge of financial facts), financial management (experience), and financial self-efficacy (confidence). This study looked at the interaction of these three components to better understand how financial literacy develops for African American college students in comparison to their peers. The findings suggest that for African American students, objective financial knowledge is not directly or indirectly associated with financial self-efficacy; only financial management is effective to establish financial self-efficacy. For their non-African American peers, both financial knowledge and financial management play a role in developing self-efficacy. Financial practitioners and educators can use these findings to create culturally responsive financial education programs to help increase financial self-efficacy and close the financial literacy gap between African American college students and their peers. Current and future financial education curricula should focus not only on how individuals perform financial management behaviors but also how to help increase a person's financial self-efficacy. This study highlights the importance of offering a variety of financial education instructional methods to make targeted financial outcomes accessible to a broader and more diverse range of students.",Anonymous, Feature,Dec,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," African Americans , Financial literacy , Financial management",ProQuest One Academic

Using Scaffolding Learning Theory as a Framework to Enhance Financial Education with Financial Planning Clients,"Financial professionals face client resistance to professional recommendations that can result in long-term effects on the outcomes of financial plans. Scaffolding Learning Theory is an effective method of teaching in various educational settings, from elementary school through college. However, financial professionals have rarely applied this theory to financial planning and literacy education. This article presents the principles of Scaffolding Learning Theory and, through a case vignette, provides an illustration of its application in both working with clients to assist in financial education, and in promoting a collaborative relationship with financial planning clients. Moreover, the case vignette elucidates differences between what clients can do with and without help, and provides a robust discussion of the benefits to financial professionals when implementing the Zone of Proximal Development concept when working with clients.","Sterbenz, Elizabeth, LMFT;Ross, Dylan L, CFP® AFC;Melton, Raylee;Smith, Jed;McCoy, Megan, PhD LMFT CFT-I;Pearson, Blain, PhD CFP®", Feature,Dec,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Theory , Methods",ProQuest One Academic
Next-Gen Advisers Embrace Collaboration,"McManus discusses collaboration among next-gen advisers. From listening to the advisers on the webinar, it was clear they were looking for a deeper working relationship with one another, one that could be part of an ongoing process to better use their individual skills and expertise. These advisers didn't want a networking opportunity or a referral relationship with one another--those are simple one-offs. Instead, they sought a deeper, more meaningful exchange where helping clients was the common goal. Close collaboration is worth considering for the following seven reasons: ego is low; outsourcing makes sense; and specialization is critical.","McManus, Kristine", Commentary,Dec,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Collaboration , Financial planners , Specialization",ProQuest One Academic
Good Timing,"Andrus discusses the apporach of financial planners to time management. For a profession that is still trying to assert its status as such, this time is invaluable. Clients are coming to planners with preconceived notions about whose interests they're serving and how they're compensated. Planners are developing innovative business models that let them build the practices they want. This thoughtful approach helps with big-picture planning, but finding the capacity to do everything they want to is a challenge many advisers face in their careers. In some cases, doing so might not involve doing more, but taking a step back to do less.","Andrus, Danielle", Editorial,Dec,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Time management",ProQuest One Academic

"To Reduce the Risk of Retirement Portfolio Exhaustion, Include Home Equity as a Non-Correlated Asset in the Portfolio","Financial planners have long regarded diversification and asset allocation as essential tools for reducing portfolio risk for their clients. This is especially true for retired clients who regularly draw on their portfolios for income. Another essential tool for risk reduction, but one not adequately recognized by financial planners, is the inclusion of home equity in the retirement portfolio, as an asset along with, and similar to, investment securities. An essential aspect of the inclusion of home equity in the portfolio is a withdrawal strategy that, in a disciplined way, uses that asset. The inclusion of home equity as an asset in the portfolio is notional; the equity serves as a source of retirement income just like the other assets in the portfolio, according to the algorithm described herein; but there is no transfer of ownership, control, or management of the home. This paper consolidates the results of several previously presented research papers and recasts them into a novel approach to the meaning of ""risk"" for certain retirees. These retirees are those whose primary source of retirement income is a securities portfolio; typically, but not necessarily, a 401(k) account or a rollover IRA. This paper is primarily an instructional vehicle, both to help financial service professionals better understand this vital concept of risk reduction and to help them better educate their colleagues and their clients about the concept. Financial planners who have clients approaching, or having recently entered, retirement, should revise their understanding of how to view the volatility of securities portfolios. For clients who are mid-career and are building wealth (i.e., not distributing from their portfolios), short-term volatility generally does not present a significant risk. By contrast, for clients who are retired and are distributing primarily from a securities portfolio for their normal living expenses, short-term volatility is risk. The adverse effects of regularly distributing from a volatile portfolio can be substantially diminished by distributions from the home equity instead of the other portfolio assets whenever determined by the algorithm described. The term ""risk"" is only meaningful if expressed in terms of a chance, a probability, of a specific event adverse to the interests or well-being of the person bearing the risk. Risk, in the context of retirement, means the probability of cash flow exhaustion or the probability of a required significant reduction in lifestyle or spending level. The probability of such an event is the measure of the risk about which this paper is concerned. Examples are presented to Illustrate the use of home equity as a component of the portfolio to Increase the percentage of Initial distribution from the securities In the portfolio to a level substantially above the traditional 4 percent and still retain an acceptably low risk of cash flow exhaustion. Financial planners who act In a fiduciary capacity should recognize the utility of the added diversification resulting from the inclusion of home equity In retirees' portfolios, and should Include this asset In fulfillment of their fiduciary duty of diversification of Investments In order to reduce risk.","Walker, Philip;Sacks, Barry H, PhD JD;Sacks, Stephen R, PhD", Feature,Dec,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Equity , Retirement planning , Portfolio management",ProQuest One Academic

Evolving Client-Adviser Conversations and The Future of Advice,"Balmuth et discuss client-adviser conversations and the future of advice. Client-adviser conversations have traditionally focused on concrete information about finances, but expanding that relationship and involving a broader range of topics may address the client's financial situation more comprehensively. A strategy coined ""longevity planning"" incorporates topics such as eldercare, health, housing, home modification, encore careers, later-life entrepreneurship, and transportation into conversations between clients and advisers, with the understanding that all these topics are intimately connected to the client's finances and their well-being in retirement.

Evaluating Operational Efficiency Needs for 2022,"Spiller discusses the evaluation of operational efficiency needs for 2022.

Even the most detailed and high-touch financial planning services fall apart without a back-office staff to focus on the business operation. This can lead to low productivity, a nosedive in profit, and a variety of other problems--including dissatisfied clients.

"Inclusive Financial Well-being Empowerment Model for Serving Independent, Neurodivergent Individuals","Financial well-being is understudied in neurodiverse populations. Previous work on the financial lives of individuals with neurodiversity demonstrates that many of these individuals need to acquire basic financial knowledge to help manage and earn money without losing benefits. This study adds to this literature by providing a model of financial empowerment that places a specific emphasis on financial engagement and personhood. Practitioner implications for working with the neurodiverse community, as well as ideas for future research, are addressed. Neurodivergent individuals, depending on the source, constitute somewhere between 20% and 41% of the human population. Autism spectrum disorder is perhaps the most well-known type of neurodiversity; however, the term ""neurodiversity"" also applies to many other groups, including those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, and dysgraphia.

Housing Considerations for Women in Retirement: Part Two,"In May 2021, Capital Caring Health surveyed a group of adults over age 50 across all races, income, and health status categories.

The Sustainability of (Global) Withdrawal Strategies,"The sustainability of a withdrawal strategy is arguably the most important financial issue that retirees have to deal with. If the withdrawals needed to sustain a desired lifestyle and bequest are not consistent with a retiree's portfolio and its expected return, given the retiree's life expectancy, then something must adjust. In fact, the most important goal of a financial plan should be to ensure that the withdrawals planned for the retirement years, including a target bequest, are consistent with a portfolio's capacity to satisfy them. To be clear, this article does not aim to develop an optimal withdrawal strategy. Rather, it aims to provide retirees and their advisers with two tools they can use periodically during retirement: One to calculate the sustainability of whatever withdrawal strategy they have chosen to implement; and another to calculate a sustainable level of inflation-adjusted withdrawals, which could be compared to whatever withdrawals they have chosen to make.","Estrada, Javier, PhD", Feature,Nov,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Sustainability , Life expectancy , Withdrawals , Retirees , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic

The ""Two American Financial Plans"" report highlights that Black people only own about 1.5 percent of the US' wealth, even though they make up 13 percent of the population. That's a large discrepancy.

Of the taxing states, 10 have a single-rate tax, while 32 states and Washington DC have graduated rate income taxes. Hawaii, with 12, has the most graduated brackets in the country. The impact of state tax liability is not to be underestimated. For example, California has a top marginal rate of 13.2 percent--the highest of any state--and no capital gains rate. The largest combined local and state tax rate in the nation, paid by the highest income earners in New York City, is currently 14.8 percent under recent legislation. Both New York and California, as well as many other states, are considering rate increases, and California is also considering a wealth tax.","Coffill, Eric J", Cover Story,Oct,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Revenue , Tax planning , Wealth tax , Personal income , Income taxes , California , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
A Continuity Plan Benefits Everyone,"""What would we ever do without you?"" That's something clients frequently say to their adviser in gratitude for the financial planning, retirement preparation, and investments the adviser manages for them. Most clients place a great deal of trust in their adviser and rely on them to take care of their family and future generations when they're no longer able to do so. Yet there's something in those words of praise that advisers should also hear: a warning. If something unexpected happens to you, who would take care of your clients? It's not a rhetorical question. At Commonwealth, they've seen a lot of bad things happen to good advisers: an adviser who was hit by a bus and was in the hospital for months; sudden illness and heart attacks; and wildfires that consumed an adviser's office and forced her to evacuate. Try as they might, there are things they can't control. You don't get to choose when something unexpected happens to you--but you can choose to be prepared.","McManus, Kristine", Commentary,Oct,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Investment , Trust , Investment advisors , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic
What to Do Before Hiring in Your Planning Practice,"Many financial planners and business owners assume that when they hit capacity in their firm, they need to start hiring. Whether you're looking to hire an administrative assistant, chief operating officer, or even an associate planner, one thing is for certain--hiring is expensive. New hires cost your firm a significant amount of money in salary and benefits. They also ""cost"" your firm time, energy, and resources to find candidates, train them, and ensure that they'll be a valuable fit on your team. Once you hire, you also run the risk of having your new employee leave shortly after hiring. Worse yet, they might not be a fit for your practice--leaving you with the unpleasant task of letting them go. The truth is that hiring can be a pain. Although it's sometimes necessary, business owners need a better solution to scale easily before they look to hire. The good news is that a solution does exist: leveraging your existing processes and technology to free up your time and create a scalable practice.","Spiller, Charesse", Feature,Oct,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Entrepreneurs , Hiring , Training , Applicants",ProQuest One Academic
The Reality of Liquidation Order for the Mass Affluent,"Much emphasis has been placed recently on the impact of taxes and the most tax-efficient order of asset liquidation for producing income in retirement. But the fact is, liquidation order primarily impacts high-net-worth clients and does not have a significant impact, if any, on mass affluent clients. Here, Lubinski sets the definition of ""mass affluent."" Equifax defines mass affluent as individuals with $100,000--$1 million of investible assets, while Nielsen defines this group as having income-producing assets between $250,000--$1 million. It has been his experience that most advisers' clients fall into the mass affluent category. Personally, his retiring clients had an average of about $700,000 of investible assets when he sold his practice in 2014, which placed them squarely.","Lubinski, Phil, CFP®", Commentary,Oct,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement income , Liquidation , Assets",ProQuest One Academic
"Emerging Markets: Primed to Outperform, but at What Risk?","The past decade catapulted emerging market economies to 39 percent of global GDP and 26 percent of global market capitalization. Even when adjusting for the accessibility of investment (the free-float), the figures are significant at 26 percent and 13 percent, respectively, according to Bloomberg and the International Monetary Fund. When examining each emerging market country, their contributions to these figures vary dramatically relative to each other. Yet as emerging markets collectively continue to gain prominence on the global stage relative to developed countries, they expect investors to be rewarded over time--not for increased growth, but rather increased risk. Many investors, however, are less likely to share our enthusiasm. Emerging markets generated 4 percent annually in total return during the 2010s, the asset class's worst decade for investment performance, according to MSCI. As a result, many investors are assessing their clients' allocation to emerging markets; either conceding to concerns for the decade-long breakdown in risk and reward, or embracing the opportunity for potential outperformance given each client's objectives and expectations.","Marotta, Ryann, CFA CFP®", Commentary,Oct,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment , Investors , Emerging markets , Gross Domestic Product--GDP",ProQuest One Academic

Taxing Times,"The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), not the most popular government agency in the best of times, has been struggling with a backlog of 35 million tax returns as of July. Taxpayers are still waiting for refunds, and legislation passed in 2020 to ease some of the economic burden on taxpayers and businesses made already complex tax rules even more confusing. Just like every other business during the pandemic, the agency had to deal with staffing shortages and location closures. But the IRS is not a business, and its challenges didn't start with the pandemic. In her 2020 annual report to Congress, Erin Collins, the National Taxpayer Advocate, identified 10 of the most serious problems taxpayers faced during the 2020 tax filing season. Almost all of them were related to outdated technology and communications operations. Clients and tax professionals who are trying to meet their obligations are being stymied by the agency's own infrastructure. Collins noted in her report that IRS employees answered less than 24 percent of the phone calls they received. Even using tools ostensibly designed to relieve some of the pressure created new headaches.","Andrus, Danielle", Editorial,Oct,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Pandemics , Taxation , Tax legislation , Tax returns , Taxpayers , Collins, Erin",ProQuest One Academic
Take Charge of Destiny,"Cumming's favorite movie is about an IRS auditor named Harold Crick. He is pretty boring, by all accounts, and doesn't have much going on in his life. Then one day, he suddenly starts hearing a woman narrating his life. She starts throwing curveballs into his life to spice up the story, and he is left to deal with her creativity. Sometimes, taxes themselves can feel like that. People don't have much control over them, and they just need to learn how to live with the decisions from above. While most items that President Joe Biden wants to push through are still in the infancy stage of discussion, he has some ambitious goals that warrant keeping an eye on. He has proposed increasing the highest marginal tax rate from 37 percent to 39.6 percent as well as increasing IRS funding to go after individual income tax enforcement. He wishes to tax long-term capital gains and dividends as ordinary income when one has taxable income above $1 million.

O.C.E.A.N.: How Does Personality Predict Financial Success?,"Purpose: Research across fields suggests that the Big Five personality traits (O.C.E.A.N.) predict individual behaviors including various financial outcomes. However, O.C.E.A.N. as a measuring tool has not caught on in the academic or applied financial planning field as extensively as it has in other disciplines. The purpose of this paper is to be the first to examine the relationship between the Big Five personality traits (O.C.E.A.N.) and four regularly collected financial outcomes-financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, income, and net worth-using a single data set. The correlational format shows the potential predictive ability of personality on various financial behaviors that is succinct and easy to understand. Hypothesis: The research hypothesis is that O.C.E.A.N is a significant predictor of financial outcomes. Specifically, 14 out of a possible 20 correlations between O.C.E.A.N. and financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, income, and net worth will be significant. Methods: Personality, financial literacy, income, and net worth were collected using a significantly powered current MTurk sample (n=412) representing the U.S. population. Correlations and OLS regressions were run controlling for age, gender, and education to test the relationship between the variables. Findings: 16 out of a possible 20 correlations between O.C.E.A.N. and financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, income, and net worth were significant, though some were different than hypothesized. Specifically, this study was the first to find that extraversion correlated positively with financial risk-taking and income but negatively with financial literacy. There was no significant relationship with net worth. Conscientiousness correlated positively with financial literacy, income, and net worth, but negatively with financial risk tolerance. Neuroticism correlated negatively with financial literacy, income, and net worth. These findings contribute to the financial planning field by demonstrating that O.C.E.A.N. can be simply and systematically collected from individuals-much like risk tolerance-which adds insight into specific financial behaviors. Possible Research Directions: Much like the systematic adoption of risk tolerance, the academic field of financial planning can be advanced by collecting robust personality data using the O.C.E.A.N. framework. This will allow for the generalization of findings from other fields over to financial planning. To assist researchers, the University of Michigan should consider adding robust measures of financial risk tolerance and personality to its valuable Health and Retirement Study. In addition, practicing financial professionals should consider collecting O.C.E.A.N. data on clients to gain additional insights into clients' behaviors over and above standalone risk tolerance.","Exley, Jim, CFP;Doyle, Patrick, PhD;Snell, Michael;Campbell, W Keith, PhD", Feature,Oct,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment , Personality traits , Financial literacy , Income , Financial services",ProQuest One Academic
Kill Dow Jones! Now!,"Cordell admits about a certain title that is a shameless attempt to grab your attention.

He wishes for you a long and prosperous life. Nor does he wishes to sully the names of Charles Dow or Edward Jones, who were founders of the company that bears their surnames. It's the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) that he would like to kill. Although that will never happen, he shares a few reasons why financial planners should forget the DJIA. What is the underlying concept of the DJIA? The word is in the title: average. It relates to the average stock price of the 30 stocks in the DJIA. That is, add all 30 stock prices and divide by a divisor. Why should anyone care about the average price of a group of stocks? Well, he supposed that changes in the average price of a set of prominent companies could give a general idea of movements in the market, but it is worse than an imperfect measure.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®, CLU", Commentary,Oct,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Stocks , Stock prices",ProQuest One Academic
How to Make the Most of Your CRM Investment,"Financial planners who rely on their customer relationship management (CRM) system solely as a contact repository could be missing out on business growth opportunities. Many planners make heavy usage of social media platforms to research prospects and current customers for insights that inform how best to serve them. Today, some CRM systems integrate with major social media platforms, so you can glean key personal information while staying compliant with data aggregation guidelines. While this capability is still in its early stages, it could yield significant business-building opportunities down the line. This can also assist in managing connections outside of the direct network. A CRM is a powerful but frequently underutilized and mistrusted tool. It should serve as a central data component that helps you define client engagement, business models, and growth opportunities.

Housing Bubbles and Near-Zero Interest Rate Environments That Inflate Property Taxes: An Unexpected Expense for Retirees?,"A retirement plan examines a large scope of potential expenditures that a retiree may have to cope with once they begin living on a fixed income. Most in the US plan well to deal with medical expenses by obtaining Medicare and supplemental insurance that pays what Medicare doesn't. However, many retirees did not consider that bubbles in the housing market in the late 1990s, early 2000s, and today, fueled by historically low and--at times--near-zero interest rates, would lead to a large increase in property taxes. Here, Schaub and Phares examine the financial impact that property taxes may have after someone retires. It explores demographics of the aging population, and how the housing market may reduce disposable income for those living on fixed incomes that don't increase by true inflation rates, or incomes that are determined by the prevailing interest rates paid on savings in the economy.","Schaub, Mark, DBA;Phares, H Banker, JD", Feature,Sep,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Interest rates , Retirees , Property taxes , Retirement planning , Medicare , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Minimizing the Damage of the Tax Torpedo,"By coordinating a Social Security (SS) claiming strategy with a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy, financial planners can add substantial value to many clients' accounts by helping them reduce their lifetime income taxes. The case below illustrates how a planner can add substantial value to a mass-affluent client with $1 million of savings by helping them minimize the adverse effects of the ""tax torpedo."" The tax torpedo refers to the income range wherein each dollar of additional income causes another $0.50 or $0.85 of SS benefits to be taxable. Thus, taxable income increases by $1.50 or $1.85. So, the marginal tax rate (MTR) is 150% or 185% of the tax bracket, where MTR denotes the additional taxes paid on the next dollar of income. Here, Reichenstein explains how financial planners can help many clients avoid, or at least minimize, the adverse effects of this tax torpedo.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA", Commentary,Sep,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Tax rates , Social security , Income taxes",ProQuest One Academic

The Importance of Managing Life - Stage Risks for an Aging Population,"When financial advice professionals talk about ""risk,"" they are usually referring to the risks associated with a portfolio of investments. Advisers typically view the preservation of wealth through successful portfolio risk management as their number one job, and in most cases, their compensation is tied directly to the performance of client investments. Today, that is no longer the case. Longer lifespans have dramatically changed the nature and severity of the financial risks faced by most clients, especially older adults. Life expectancy was 58 years for a man born in 1930 and about 61 for a woman. Today, a typical 60-year-old man can expect to live another 23 years; a woman, 25 more years. When longevity risk is applied to individuals, it refers to the chance that a person will outlive their savings.

Regardless of the motivation, accurately assessing risk tolerance is more difficult than many would like to admit. Most assessments of risk tolerance rely upon a single mode of assessment, either a stated preference or a revealed preference. Ultimately, both come with significant limitations.

Individuals who frequently use app-based and web-based financial planning products are allocat ing attentional resources to their financial situation; thus, financial planning product usage serves as a proxy to measure study participants' PFS. Data collected from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study (N = 18,231) show that 2,610 (14.3 percent), 5,861 (32.15 percent), and 9,760 (53.54 percent) of participants frequently, sometimes, or never use financial planning products, respectively. The findings from multivariate analyses highlight that when compared to individuals who never use financial planning products, those who sometimes and those who frequently use financial planning products are more likely to find it easier to cover their bills, have an emergency fund, have a plan for their children's college education, and have a plan for retirement. Financial planners can effectively utilize the concept of PFS in their practices. Creating an organizational hierarchy of financial task assignments and respective completion dates instills PFS. Furthermore, coordinating task assignments with salient reminders can further strengthen PFS and healthy financial behaviors.","Pearson, Blain, PhD CFP®", Feature,Aug,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Consumer behavior , Sales taxes , Personal finance",ProQuest One Academic
"My Career Path Featuring Katrina Soelter, CFP®","Katrina Soelter's first career was not financial planning. She joined Teach for America and earned a master's in reading instruction while teaching elementary school. However, she realized pretty quickly that it wasn't the best fit for her. Soelter wasn't sure at first what to do with that realization, but luckily, moms always know best. In the post-Great Recession era, Soelter wasn't fully sold on the reputation of the wider financial services industry. She started to research different fields within the industry and sought informational interviews with anyone who could make some time for her. That led her to financial planning and CFP® certification but introduced a new obstacle.

Faced with a Conflict of Interest: What Should Advisers Consider?,"While there are a significant number of articles in the professional press and in professional conversations about conflicts of interest (COI), encountering a conflict of interest may be an unusual experience for many financial planners. For that reason, considering how such a situation might develop may be useful for financial planners in practice. In reviewing situations to consider, CFP Board's Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct (www.cfp.net/ethics/code-of-ethics-and-standards-of-conduct) will provide the ethical frame of reference. At this point, a CFP® professional should review the requirements from CFP Board's Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct before accepting an engagement with a potential client with whom the financial planner has a COI. While a financial planner may be committed to the requirements of the Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct involving the duties to disclose and manage a COI, this process does not guarantee the COI will be completely of no influence upon the CFP® professional.","Bearden, Frank C, PhD CLU® ChFC®", Commentary,Aug,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Conflicts of interest , Professional ethics",ProQuest One Academic
"How to Estimate ""The End"" of Retirement","Client-specific information can and should result in significantly different forecasted retirement periods. After a review of assumptions used in 31,211 financial plans in Canada, retirement end age assumptions do not appear to be very personalized, given the prevalence of certain end ages, especially those that are a multiple of five (for example, approximately 70 percent of plans used age 90, and 20 percent of plans used age 95). Assumptions used by financial advisers also did not appear to incorporate the additional ""tail risk"" associated with the longer potential retirement period for a married couple. The length of retirement in a financial plan should be determined considering the shortfall aversion metric (for example, probability of success) to ensure recommendations are not overly conservative. Adding five years to projected life expectancy for a single household and eight years to the longest life expectancy of either member of a joint household (or to each member if separate end ages are used), at retirement, is an appropriate retirement end age assumption if the outcome variable is the probability of success (using a Monte Carlo model) and only fixed periods can be modeled (mortality rates are not directly incorporated). This approach suggests a retirement period of 30 years (to age 95) is a reasonable assumption for the average 65-yearold male/female couple retiring today. Retirement period assumptions should be revisited regularly to ensure they are timely, similar to other key assumptions in a financial plan.","Blanchett, David M, PhD CFP® CFA", Feature,Aug,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Life expectancy , Retirement planning , Canada",ProQuest One Academic

Housing Considerations for Women in Retirement,"Last year, COVID-19 forced us all to experience what living at home when retired might be like. Items that were easily ignored when you weren't home that much no longer were. No wonder home improvement, and furniture and appliance sales, have gone through the roof! Many homeowners were motivated to move to larger homes in the suburbs or to more remote vacation locations. One wonders if this trend is a permanent or a transitory one. In any case, we all have a better idea of what life in retirement might be like when we will be spending more time at home. One of the major issues clients need to consider as they plan for retirement is the cost of continuing to live in their current location. For someone living alone, which often is a woman, sharing her home with another person on a temporary or permanent basis might be a good idea.","Armstrong, Alexandra, CFP®, CRPC", Commentary,Aug,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," COVID-19 , Homeowners , Women , Financial planning , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic
"To Take Your Practice to the Next Level, Hire a Paraplanner","One of the most successful business stories in US history is that of McDonald's. In many ways, McDonald's epitomizes the American business model of fast, friendly service. This mega-chain started simply when two brothers, Richard and Maurice McDonald, decided to open a humble hamburger stand in 1940. By 2019, McDonald's system-wide sales exceeded $100 billion. As a matter of public record, the company's market cap hovers around $160 billion. Trained paraplanners can be identified by the FPQP™ designation, which stands for Financial Paraplanner Qualified Professional™. Paraplanners are specifically educated to help financial planners. Their ongoing service to financial planners is comparable to the manner in which paralegals help lawyers. The paraplanner's areas of expertise mirror the financial planner's: investments, insurance, retirement, and estate planning. Hiring a paraplanner can also help increase client retention by providing service after the sale.","Angell, Michael, CFP® EA", Feature,Aug,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Success factors , Fast food industry , Business growth , Estate planning",ProQuest One Academic

Their staff and volunteers were on the front line, battling the effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic. They helped families in their community with housing assistance, food, childcare, life skills, and personal finance courses. The number one lesson that he learned is that financial poverty is only one type of poverty that pro bono work addresses. For them as financial planners, it is probably the most natural, and it is for that very reason that we need to proceed with caution. Many of them are impoverished in other areas of their lives. The impact of the pro bono work they do is powerful because it can provide the means to address their own areas of poverty.","Eaton, Kyle, CFP® CDFA®", Commentary,Aug,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Poverty , COVID-19 , Low income groups , Homeless people , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

FIRE clients have a complicated balancing act to pull off in that they need to tame their propensity to spend money now instead of properly delaying it for future satisfaction, while simultaneously making sure their finances are flexible enough in the future to accommodate shifts in their values as they age.

The Reimagination of Conventional Retirement Savings Wisdom,"On Mar 11, 2021, newly elected Pres Joe Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package designed to lift the US economy out of recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The act primarily centers on rebate checks, credits, subsidies, and exclusions, but that is not what has everyone talking. Instead, it is Biden's proposed tax plan--which primarily focuses on America's high-income and wealthy individuals. Conventional planning wisdom tells us two things. First, you should start saving early and often so you can enjoy the miracles of compound interest. Second, tax avoidance (not evasion) is perfectly acceptable and encouraged, and you should only pay what you owe. As such, the choice of retirement saving vehicles becomes a critical decision toward long-term financial success. Generally speaking, lower marginal taxpayers will benefit more from post-tax accounts such as Roth 401(k)s and IRAs because their marginal rate will likely be higher in future years.","Johnson, Dan, CFP®, EA", Commentary,Aug,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," COVID-19 , Pandemics , Tax legislation , Tax avoidance , Retirement planning , Savings plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

You're a Financial Planner...Now What? On Creating Rational and Impactful Goals,"Ryan Murphy, PhD, and Samantha Lamas work in an area of the profession where human nature and market science intersect. In their latest project, a nationwide study that won the 2020 Montgomery- Warschauer Award, they tackled a complex question: Why do investors say they want one thing but pursue other courses of action? Their team's initial search led them to the literature on cognitive blind spots, the ways that people become blind to mistakes they are making. As they researched further, they discovered that these well-established patterns in behavior science were wreaking havoc in financial planning conversations. Along with their teammate Ray Sin, PhD, Ryan and Sam developed and tested a three-step technique to help investors become more aware of their true financial goals. The experimental approach was centered on a simple checklist that helped clients slow down and consider the full range of possibilities, then choose investment objectives that were truly compelling and personally meaningful.","Moore, Hannah, CFP®", Feature,Jul,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Investors , Financial planning , Investment , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic
Consider Your Past to Determine Your Niche,"Career changers should consider using their prior career experience as a springboard to clients. This could include experience with a prior employer, prior employer type, or prior profession. Prior experience in these areas provide an automatic niche of expertise, and your name is already known to former colleagues as an internal expert. If you're a career changer, you are coming at the financial planning profession in a non-traditional way. That may mean finding part-time work on nights and weekends while you persist in the prior profession to keep your income up, especially if you have a family to support. Specializing in one or a small handful of similar, large companies will give the career changer an automatic niche of expertise and allow them to leverage prior experiences.

In 2019, the American Public Education Foundation found that 34 states earned grades of ""C"" or less for financial literacy instruction in their schools, and just 16 states earned grades of ""A"" or ""B.""

Each of these conversations can be a turning point for both their personal and financial life, and as financial planners, it's important we are well-versed in the nuances of these decisions.

These results will come as little surprise to financial advisers who counsel clients every day, and they underscore that aggregate markets may behave in such a way as to reflect these systematic investment biases. It is the aggregation of these behavioral tendencies, and the predictability that they impart on asset markets, that motivated the development of the cyclically adjusted PE ratio (CAPE) as a predictor of US and international equity markets. RISK is easily built from publicly available data and can be demonstrated to forecast long-term aggregate equity market returns with an effectiveness similar to CAPE.

Future Investment Returns on Housing Are Stark,"Early life experiences shape your lens of money throughout your life. If you grew up in the Great Depression, you thought of the stock market as risky. It's the opposite for baby boomers. Boomers--who profited from the bull market of the 80s and 90s--had a relatively positive experience with stock market investing. Millennials have their own distinct lens. They witnessed their boomer parents do well by real estate--at least for the most part. For many millennials, the investment returns on a personal residence are guaranteed (with the occasional bubble thrown in to keep you on your toes). Here, Luskin recently thought of this millennial real estate investing paradigm when chatting with an old friend. They were talking about personal finance. His friend was convinced that maxing out his 401(k) was completely unnecessary. That's because he was planning to cash out on his personal residence in retirement, using the proceeds to fund his golden years.

The Time for ESG Investing Is Now,"In the realm of ESG investing, people know two things to be true: investor demand is increasing, and the supply of investment product is vast and bewildering. In 2020 alone, over $50 billion was added to ESG investment funds--more than double that of the previous year. Although opportunity abounds for those who stand ready to navigate the ESG waters, many financial advisers are still wary of properly researching and implementing ESG investment strategies for clients. ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance, and is best thought of as a Venn diagram highlighting sustainability factors for a given company. Asset managers source data from companies to measure and analyze these factors, allowing them to create investment products favoring companies that compare relatively well. ESG investing is by no means a passing trend. In fact, the concept of impact investing predates modern financial markets with references in early religious texts that continue to guide investment philosophies today.

As a Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards (CFP Board) Ambassador, Rita helps educate the public, policymakers and media about elevating the profession. She has also served on the FPA's National Board of Directors from 2013 to 2015 and was president of the Financial Planning Association of the National Capital Area (FPA NCA). One of the most fascinating things about Rita is the story of how she got where she is today. She studied East Asian language and literature as well as finance in college. She wasn't aware of the discipline of personal finance and how to apply corporate finance principles to individuals and families. Thanks to her dad, she learned a lot about the ""tactical"" parts of personal finance.","Davis, Alexandria", Feature,Jun,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Reputations , Financial planners , Financial planning , Professions , Personal finance , Cheng, Marguerita M",ProQuest One Academic
My Career Path Featuring Miranda Reiter,"When she was growing up, Miranda had a vivid imagination. She remembers pretending to own a clothing store--operating the cash register and merchandising the imaginary storefront. She had always admired her teachers when she was young, so she also pretended to be a teacher at home. After she graduated from Mississippi State University, she wanted to move to France and live the French life. But the US had just gone to war in Iraq, and since France had not been on board with the plan, she didn't think it was a good idea. When it came time for Miranda to select the area in the bank where she wanted to work, she wanted to choose wealth management, but her mentor discouraged her from doing so, to her dismay. Instead, she chose consumer banking and found that it seemed more receptive to people of color in that division. She said that the journey to becoming Dr. Miranda Reiter was a culmination of a lot of experiences. Yet, after several years of working in banking, Miranda became dissatisfied.","Reiter, Miranda, PhD CFP", Commentary,Jun,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Professions , Teaching , Personal experiences , Wealth management , Retail banking , France",ProQuest One Academic

Student Loan Planning in Response to COVID-19 and Recent Legislation,"If you speak with any financial, tax, or legal professional, the consensus is usually the same--there has been an overwhelming amount of legislation passed in recent years. In 2017, there was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), arguably the largest tax reform within the past two decades. Two years later, Congress passed the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act (SECURE Act), bringing substantial changes to the employee benefit and retirement space. Then in 2020, the world came to a standstill due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To avoid a crippling and prolonged recession, the US Congress passed three stimulus packages. Altogether, each of the five bills impacts taxpayers in slightly different ways, but they share a high degree of correlation. This includes tax bracket and marginal rate adjustments, revised credits, stimulus checks, and employee benefit and retirement options. Yet despite the numerous legislative changes, there is one area that has gone relatively untouched: student loans.","Johnson, Dan, CFP® EA", Feature,Jun,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Pandemics , Retirement , Student loans , Tax legislation , Tax reform , Taxpayers",ProQuest One Academic
"Learn, Listen, and Lead on Cryptoassets","Ross gets many calls from financial advisers ranging from excitement to rage. Many times, these calls come after advisers have conducted a meeting and learned that their client holds a meaningful position in crypto. Another common occurrence is an adviser learning a client has multimillions in a Coinbase account. In the worst cases, the adviser learns a position accrued massive capital gains, but the client was also being remunerated in a particular crypto. For an unsuspecting adviser who may have been hoping to avoid this ""speculative mania,"" this finding is the rude awakening that crypto is here to stay. Your clients own some, believe it. In fact, the 2021 Trends in Investing Survey, conducted by the Journal of Financial Planning and FPA, and supported by Onramp Invest, found that 15 percent of advisers surveyed currently use or recommend cryptocurrencies with their clients, which is up from less than 1 percent in the 2020 survey. Twenty-six percent of advisers said they plan to increase their use or recommendation of cryptocurrencies in the next year. Also, 49 percent said their clients have asked about cryptocurrencies in the past six months, up from just 1 percent a year ago.","Ross, Tyrone", Cover Story,Jun,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Polls & surveys , Digital currencies , Capital gains",ProQuest One Academic

He had interviewed a lot of people in the last few weeks and made three job offers, and he realized that he didn't know what school any of those three people attended. He's a big proponent of academia, education and continued learning, but he couldn't tell where any of those three people attended school.

"Understanding the Intersection Between Style Exposure, Sector Rotation, and the Business Cycle","Financial planners and Investors generally tend to evaluate their equity allocation either through the lens of sector exposure or through the lens of style exposure. In reality, these two dimensions are highly related. Using holdings-based style analysis, this research shows that the average funds in the Morningstar large-cap growth and large-cap value categories tend to overweight or underweight certain sectors relative to the broad stock market, while SPDR sector ETFs vary greatly in their exposure to growth and value stocks. Returns-based style analysis based on the Fama-French Three-Factor Model confirms that certain sectors exhibit strong and consistent style biases. Specifically, the technology sector has historically exhibited the strongest growth bias, while the financial sector exhibited the strongest value bias. After introducing a relatively simple definition of the business cycle, authors proceed to analyze the performance of sectors through the different phases of the cycle and demonstrate that certain groups of sectors tend to consistently perform better in specific phases of the cycle. Authors demonstrate how a relatively simple investment strategy that actively rotates between sectors-based on changes in the business cycle-would have consistently and significantly outperformed the broad stock market. Authors then analyze the style characteristics of such a strategy. This paper concludes by showing that the aforementioned strategy, when implemented as a 15 percent satellite to an otherwise passive and broadly diversified portfolio, would significantly improve the risk/return characteristics of the portfolio.","Noble, Carl, CFA;Dillon, Sean, CMT CFTe;Locatelli, Sauro, CFA FRM SCR™;Mento, Dan, CFA;Solow, Ken, CFP®", Feature,May,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Investors , Financial planners , Business cycles , Securities markets",ProQuest One Academic
Transitioning Current Clients to a New Service Model,"As the financial advice industry continues to evolve, Spiller is seeing a steady increase in the different types of services that financial planners offer to their clients. From a business perspective, this allows planners to tailor their services to their unique clientele or offer services that better meet their personal needs and lifestyle goals as a business owner. From a client's perspective, the wide variety of services means they can find a planner who offers exactly what they need. In other words, this change is a ""win"" for firm owners and consumers alike. The biggest shift she's seeing in the financial planning profession is planners pivoting toward a service model that prioritizes their expertise, not tangible deliverables.

Social Security Claiming Strategies for Singles and Their Implications for Couples,"Here, Reichenstein and Meyer present important insights related to the optimal Social Security claiming age for a single individual. The first section demonstrates that in order to maximize expected real (inflation-adjusted) lifetime Social Security benefits, it is seldom optimal for a single retiree to claim benefits in any month near either of two dates. The first date is 36 months prior to the full retirement age (FRA), while the second date is the FRA. The second section discusses four other factors that the single retiree should consider when selecting their claiming age. Each of these factors should encourage single individuals to delay claiming Social Security beyond this lifetime maximizing age. The report then explains when the lessons from the first section related to maximizing a single retiree's expected real lifetime benefits also apply to the claiming strategy for each partner of a married couple.","Reichenstein, William, PhD CFA;Meyer, William", Feature,May,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Couples , Marriage , Social security , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic
3 Guidelines for a Successful Social Media Strategy,"Social media and its use for financial planning practices are fairly new and it is becoming a must for the field.

Sprung would argue that every adviser needs to consider adding this component to their firm, whether they are brand new or a 40-year veteran. Social media can be an excellent tool to build relationships and your brand, share your story and essentially drive new business. Traditionally, a firm would look to advertise, produce mailings and conduct seminars--and there are a host of other marketing options available. Social media allows you to cast a wide or narrow net depending on what you are looking to accomplish, while getting immediate results to see how your campaign is performing. Here, Sprung presents 3 guidelines for a successful social media strategy.","Sprung, Lawrence", Commentary,May,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Guidelines , Strategic planning , Social networks",ProQuest One Academic
Use Leadership Skills That Apply to Behavioral Economics to Avoid the Sunk Cost Fallacy,"Coach Vince Lombardi exhorted his players, telling them, ""Winners never quit, and quitters never win."" Following this advice in a financial planning practice can lead to costly problems because, sometimes, quitting a project is the best option. Not quitting could result in throwing good money after bad. Practice leaders need to be aware of this possibility and use their leadership skills to avoid this dysfunction or lead their team to the correct change of course. Four elements of behavioral economics--loss aversion, commitment, status quo bias, and people mentally accounting for costs and benefits in silos rather than the aggregate--combine into a powerful force against making the right decision by supporting the attraction of the sunk cost fallacy. While loss aversion is generally about objective investments like money, commitment refers to the decision-maker's perception of how others would view their quitting.","Smith, David F, PhD CFP®", Commentary,May,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Decision making , Leadership , Behavioral economics",ProQuest One Academic

How Much Did Rebalancing Help in 2020?,"Investment professionals are presumably familiar with portfolio rebalancing and employ some type of rebalance strategy. Rebalancing is the act of returning a portfolio to its ""target"" allocation to keep portfolios near an expressed risk preference. Rebalancing is necessary because portfolios drift from targets over time. As an example, an investor who started a 60/40 portfolio in July 2008 and never rebalanced would have more than 75 percent in stocks just 10 years later. This would clearly represent a riskier portfolio than originally implemented. Here, Delorme looks at whether common rebalancing strategies helped portfolio performance and recovery in 2020.

They are the executives and employees of large corporations who are shipped to various global destinations to work for a period of time before being shipped again to yet another destination. Amid all of this activity, cross-border individuals marry those with citizenships different from their own and raise their children in non-US countries. Even an increasing number of US individuals who have remained stateside for their entire lives find that their grandchildren are being born abroad, due to their children's global activities.

The good news is that parents and students have access to many different savings vehicles, some of which are specifically designed to fund education-related goals and provide significant tax advantages, such as Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (CESAs) and Qualified Tuition Programs (529 College Savings Plans). Additionally, different financing options are provided by both the federal government and private lenders to students and their parents. According to a 2019 report from Sallie Mae and Ipsos, 66 percent of families relied on parent income and savings, 65 percent of families relied on student income and savings, 82 percent of families relied on grants and scholarships, 21 percent of families relied on parent borrowing, and 38 percent of families relied on student borrowing to help pay for higher education costs.","Riskin, Ross A, DBA, CPA/PFS, CCFC", Journal Article,Mar,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Higher education , Education finance , Education expenses , Qualified tuition programs , Cost control , Lenders , Student financial aid",ProQuest One Academic
Elevating the Profession by Reimagining What's 'Professional',"Bernard admits that before changing careers from culinary arts to financial planning, he often found himself depositing weekly takings at a local bank. On one such occasion, a dapper financial professional in a suit began soliciting him for business. A great privilege of working with food is that feedback is terse but abundant: if the food sucks, you'll know quickly. This isn't a pleasure enjoyed (often) by financial professionals. They pride themselves in intuiting clients. That said, they are not as good at mindreading as they might think they are or so says a team from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Los Angeles. So, starting a conversation on how clients are affected by an adviser's appearance makes sense. Subtle ways advisers conduct themselves truly matter. Things they don't often consider can tremendously impact clients. In fact, simply by your heart rate quickening, you may unintentionally make your clients more anxious, according to research from HeartMath Institute.","Bernard, Rafael, CFP®", Journal Article,Mar,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Client relationships",ProQuest One Academic

Build on Success: 4 Steps to More Client Loyalty and Increased Trust,"The challenges of 2020 eroded trust in governments, institutions, leaders, and media, globally. However, proactive communication will continue to build client trust and loyalty. Clients are wondering about the financial market going forward. They see a disconnect between how well the market recovered in 2020 and the economic hardships caused by the pandemic. Questions about taxes and other changes coming with the administration of US President-elect Joe Biden are common as well. On the upside, many clients entered 2021 with optimism. They are grateful for their blessings. In addition, they are confident that Americans and American businesses are innovative and resilient. The speed of vaccine development by US pharmaceutical companies, and rapid innovation by large and small businesses are celebrated. Here, practical steps to boost client loyalty and increase trust are offered.

Mediation Techniques for Financial Planners,"At first glance, it would appear that financial planners and mediators have nothing in common. Financial planners advise individuals, couples, families, business owners, and corporations to help them meet their long-term financial objectives. Mediators facilitate dialogue between two or more parties to help them reach an agreement. That is what financial planners and mediators do. But if you consider why clients hire each of these professionals--and also consider the skillset required by both in order to be successful--you will find striking similarities. Clients hire financial planners and mediators for the same reason: to help them identify their goals and design a path to achieve them. In order to best serve their clients, both professionals must fully understand their clients' needs, interests, fears, and priorities. Successful financial planners--just like successful mediators--are experts at connecting with clients and establishing rapport and trust. Here, three cornerstone mediation techniques financial planners can learn and use with clients are offered. Incorporating these powerful communication tools will strengthen your relationships with clients, deepen your insights about who your clients are as you analyze their financial options, and enable you to skillfully facilitate challenging conversations about money. It includes active listening, asking open-ended questions and reframing.","Goldman, Rachel, JD, CPC, ELI-MP", Journal Article,Mar,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Listening , Communication , Client relationships , Mediation , Mediators",ProQuest One Academic

Effective Listening Is Key to Building Trust,"Effective listening is key to building trust. There's just something about feeling truly heard that makes you trust that person who's truly listening to you. Good listeners ""make you feel better not merely passively absorbing, but by actively supporting,"" write Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman in the Harvard Business Review article ""What Great Listeners Actually Do."" ""This lets you gain energy and height, just like someone jumping on a trampoline."" The first step in becoming a good listener is to have a sense of self-awareness. The second step is to really be present when your clients are talking, and to seek to understand what they are saying. Don't type notes and don't look at your watch or your phone. If you're on Zoom, have them on the screen with your camera, so it doesn't appear as if you're looking at a separate screen and not paying attention. Don't talk when they are talking. Give them cues that you're listening--like nodding your head. Repeat what they've said back to them, so they can confirm you've understood. Ask clarifying questions. The next step is asking quality questions based on the information your clients have already told you.",Anonymous, Journal Article,Mar,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Listening , Trust , Self awareness , Interpersonal communication",ProQuest One Academic
How to Use Stories to Motivate Current and Prospective Clients,"Kornegay discusses how to use stories to motivate current and prospective clients. Stories provide a wonderful way to connect people and ideas. A story does what facts and statistics never can: it inspires and motivates. Financial planners facilitate change every day. It's no accident that the Financial Planning Association believes in ""elevating the profession that transforms lives through the power of financial planning"". Most clients aren't looking for a financial plan as much as they are looking to see a difference in their lives. The story should also resonate with the listener. As the story unfolds, he or she should feel like it describes them or someone they know. Perhaps they, too, are worried about their finances. Maybe they have a friend or family member that sounds just like the client you are describing. Finally, the story should demonstrate how your care and expertise was instrumental to the change. Perhaps your knowledge of cash balance plans led a client to significantly increase her savings rate.","Kornegay, Adam, RCC™", Journal Article,Mar,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Motivation , Savings , Storytelling , Conversion",ProQuest One Academic

But the great wealth transfer they've been hearing so much about is coming. And the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated those intergenerational conversations about money and estate planning (due to the yearlong looming threat of infection and death) for some families.

Right-Sizing Retirement: Exploring the Retirement Consumption Gap in Early Retirement,"* Research suggests some households underspend in retirement, resulting in a ""retirement consumption gap."" This paper explores this effect, specifically during the first 10 years of retirement, and incorporates both household assets and preretirement spending using data from the Health and Retirement Study. * Only 18 percent of households have enough wealth to cover pre-retirement consumption when they retire, which suggests most households will not be able to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle in retirement-a finding consistent with other general estimates of the retirement readiness of Americans. * Real financial assets decline for 65 percent of households during the first 10 years of retirement, with a median real decline of 35 percent. * Real retiree spending declines for 75 percent of households during the first 10 years of retirement, with a median annual decline of approximately 2 percent per year. This suggests financial planners should consider changes in retirement spending that are less than inflation as part of a retirement plan. The percentage of households that can fund their retirement consumption increases dramatically during the first 10 years of retirement, from 18 percent to 48 percent, primarily due to reductions in spending. This suggests households ""right-size"" their spending early in retirement to better align with available resources. It is not clear, though, to what extent this behavior persists further into retirement (due to data limitations). Many well-funded households could increase consumption, but appear not to do so (i.e., exhibit a retirement consumption gap). Potential reasons include the desire to leave a bequest, uncertain medical expenses (especially late in retirement), uncertain life expectancy, etc. While this group is a minority of retiree households, understanding what drives this behavior is especially important to financial planners since this group tends to have the most accumulated wealth and are, therefore, more likely to seek the services of, or use, a financial planner.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP;Cormier, Warren", Journal Article,Feb,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement , Financial planning , Personal finance , Consumption , Early retirement , Retirement planning , Financial planners , Households",ProQuest One Academic

While the conventional approach to measuring individual wealth is through an estimation of the dollar value of financial assets (cash, stocks, bonds, etc.) and real assets (real estate, private business, etc.), such a view deemphasizes human capital. Yet, human capital, rather than financial capital, is responsible for the bulk of the wealth for most individuals during most stages of their lives, especially during their younger years. Furthermore, the value of an individual's financial and real asset portfolio often reflects the human capital value possessed by the individual in the past because a relationship exists between the value of human capital and an individual's long-term financial wealth.","Timmerman, Inga, PhD CFP;Volkov, Nikanor", Journal Article,Feb,2021,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Real estate , Human capital , Wealth",ProQuest One Academic

However, the definition of MAGI varies with each use. For married couples filing jointly, no Social Security benefits are taxable if their PI is below $32,000.

The Roth/Pretax Decision in Late Career Years: The Increasing Importance of Accumulated Assets in Light of the SECURE Act,"Many people have two tax-advantaged options to save for retirement: Roth and pretax contributions. With Roth, an investor gets no tax break upon contribution, but qualified distributions in retirement are tax-free. Pretax (also referred to as traditional or tax-deferred) contributions reduce taxable income, but distributions are taxed as ordinary income. Researchers agree that the Roth/pretax decision should largely be based on a person's expected tax rates, at the time of contribution versus distribution.

It also helps to hold you accountable. There is a famous saying that goes ""plan your work and work your plan.""

A Framework for Choosing a Business Model to Fit the Evolving Needs of Your Business and Clients,"It's important to reinforce that there is no ""right"" model for every practice--there are pros and cons of each. Here, Law provides a context that will allow you to evaluate the attributes of the various alternatives, so you can determine which best fits the needs of your business and clients. It is also worth noting that the business model that fits your needs can--and often does--change over time as you and your business move through the stages of your career. As you contemplate the evolving needs of your clients and business, it's important to understand that what was the best fit a decade ago may not be the ideal solution today.

Safely Boosting Retirement Income by Harmonizing Drawdown Paths,"Building on Bengen's famous 4 percent rule (Bengen 1994), this paper introduces the DMSWR, a technique for calculating withdrawal rates and retirement income levels that are safe, steady, and adjusted for inflation. The DMSWR (named after the authors' initials, plus the acronym for safe withdrawal rate) addresses two commonly cited shortcomings of the 4 percent rule. First, it addresses the starting point paradox (Kitces 2008) by ensuring that initial retirement incomes are stable regardless of the precise retirement date and short-term fluctuations in the stock market. Second, the DMSWR significantly reduces the risk of unnecessarily low retirement income that leads to large, unspent portfolios at the end retirement. The DMSWR provides withdrawal rates that are often substantially higher, and never lower, than the 4 percent rule, which allows financial planners to recommend higher retirement incomes that are still safe. The core insight underpinning the DMSWR is that a retiree can safely follow the ""drawdown path"" of an earlier retiree who follows the 4 percent rule and planned for a longer retirement.","Marwood, David;Minnen, David, PhD", Journal Article,Nov,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement income , Income taxes , Retirement planning , Distribution of retirement plan assets",ProQuest One Academic

Logistic regression results of the likelihood of three different types of life insurance ownership from the 1992-2016 SCF dataset, controlling for various household characteristics, indicated there was a negative relationship between the survey year and the likelihood of life insurance ownership for any life insurance and cash value life insurance.

When Dementia Takes Over the Corner Office,"Sharon is a force of nature. At 72 years of age, she's spry, she's fearless, she's the president of a multi-milliondollar family business and she's quietly becoming demented. The saga of the dementing leader is a real-life drama playing out with increasing regularity in executive offices around the country. In farms and finance, in manufacturing and medicine, business owners are living and working longer. As a result, the odds of a leader becoming mentally incapacitated while still 'in the saddle' are rising. This is particularly germane to CFP practitioners on two fronts: many work with business owners who will be experiencing cognitive decline; and many are business owners themselves who will be experiencing decline. When board members, business partners, or family members wait too long to address these situations, the range of available responses becomes severely truncated.

We then interviewed diversity and inclusion experts on ways to address those common problems. Diversity efforts won't be successful until firm and company cultures make talented, diverse employees feel included and welcome. If we don't address these problems, chances are, we won't retain diverse talent. In this world, as a person of color, it's always a challenge getting clients,"" he said.

It's a valuable but limited approach that can reduce the tax impact and philanthropic potential of the donations, especially for high-net-worth clients.

Utilizing What We Know About Tele-Mental Health in Tele- Financial Planning: A Systematic Literature Review,"The coronavirus pandemic expanded the adoption of virtual financial planning, or tele-financial planning practices, as it's referred to in this paper. Unfortunately, limited empirical research on telefinancial planning exists to guide planners through this transition. However, there are similarities between financial planning and counseling; therefore, a systematic literature review on tele-mental health interventions was conducted to provide guidance for financial planning practices and future research. Research suggests the efficacy of tele-mental health is comparable to face-to-face delivery while creating greater efficiency for the therapist and the patient. The breadth and severity of conditions treated suggest that this delivery method is a viable channel, not a convenient stopgap for extraordinary circumstances or lower-value engagements. These findings suggest financial planners might leverage a virtual delivery channel to provide effective recommendations while expanding their reach and providing an experience that is less stressful and more convenient. The operational efficiencies experienced in tele-mental health suggest that financial planners could also improve the efficiency of their practices. Planners should proactively ensure that all clients have the resources and knowledge to engage in a virtual capacity and review their data security measures. For the financial planning profession to advance, practitioners cannot solely rely on research and best practices from related disciplines. Thus, this paper serves as a call for further study on telefinancial planning.","Sensenig, Derek J, CFP®;Walsh, Brian, CFP®;Machiz, Ives, CFP®;Stanley, Nicolas, CFP®;Russell, Matthew;McCoy, Megan, PhD LMFT CFT-I™"," Evidence Based Healthcare , Journal Article",Sep,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , COVID-19 , Pandemics , Counseling , Mental health , Studies , Teleconferencing , Financial planners , Literature reviews , Systematic review",ProQuest One Academic

An International Perspective: The Evolution of Financial Services in Canada,"For the past several years, the Canadian financial services industry has been undergoing a slow-moving evolution, and in spite of the COVID-19 crisis, 2020 is shaping up to be another year of continued change. To better understand how it's changing, let's look at the current state of the Canadian financial services landscape. Canada's population of 37.6 million is spread across 10 provinces and three territories, in the second largest (by landmass) country in the world. Canada has two official languages, English and French, and while most of the country is governed by common law, the province of Quebec follows the civil code. Financial industry regulation in Canada has largely fallen under the purview of the provinces (as they have constitutional jurisdiction over ""property"") and carried out in practice by a handful of inter-provincial selfregulating organizations. This piecemeal approach has meant fragmented securities regulations and has complicated efforts toward financial and securities market reform.","Pereira, Jason, CFP®;Macqueen, Alexandra, CFP®", Journal Article,Sep,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," COVID-19 , Jurisdiction , Common law , Provinces , Securities regulations , Financial services , Canada",ProQuest One Academic

The Ripple Effect: Potential Consequences of a Conflict of Interest,"To understand the importance of a conflict of interest in professional practice, a financial planner should understand the potential consequences of a conflict of interest to the client and to the planner. A conflict of interest is an interest a financial planner has or is considering that is likely to interfere with the fiduciary duty the financial planner has to a client, to the extent that the fiduciary duty will not be enacted in the client's best interest. The consequences of a conflict of interest can be visualized through the metaphor of the ripple effect. To be fully understood and appreciated, each of these ripples should be carefully considered. As a result of the life insurance planning John provided for Bill, John recommended that Bill apply for a $5 million life insurance policy for Bill to provide for his family, in the event of an untimely death. John is a licensed life insurance agent and thus recommended to Bill that he complete and file the application.","Bearden, Frank C, PhD, CLU®, ChFC®", Journal Article,Sep,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Conflicts of interest , Insurance policies , Fiduciary responsibility , Life insurance , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Introducing a Hierarchy of Financial Wellness,"If you are playing a game of financial jargon bingo, you definitely want to have the square labeled ""financial wellness"" on your card. It seems almost every wealth management firm, insurance company, and employee benefit provider is promising to deliver ""financial wellness"" to their respective clients. It is understandable in the new normal of COVID-19 that corporate marketing departments and industry consultants would adopt this language. The term ""financial wellness"" sounds ""healthy,"" and attaching it to a firm's products or services creates the perception that these offerings are endowed with special healing properties. Organizational wellness has both quantitative and qualitative components. It means not only that a person has a good handle on managing and tracking expenses, planning for a major expense, or has adequately prepared for retirement (quantitative component). But good financial management requires having plans in place for both the successful transition of financial decision-making authority in the case of illness or death, as well as the safe and secure transfer of wealth to the next generation.","Heye, Chris, PhD", Journal Article,Sep,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," COVID-19 , Financial planners , Decision making , Financial management , Wellness programs , Wealth management",ProQuest One Academic

6 Essentials for Building Successful Family Teams,"Kornegay discusses the essentials for building successful family teams. Increasingly, people hear from financial planners who are thinking about or taking initial steps toward bringing a family member into their practice. Some are looking to expand their team to meet the needs of their growing business; others may be more concerned about providing continuity for clients and an exit strategy for themselves. Not surprisingly, for some it's a win-win, but for others it can be a recipe for disaster. Over many years of working with family teams--six essentials for building and maintaining successful family teams are identified. It includes the universal framework for communication, a shared vision for the future, a transformational client experience, a marketing message that leverages the family's strengths, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and a well planned legacy strategy.","Kornegay, Adam;Ursiny, Zach", Journal Article,Aug,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Business communications , Family owned businesses , Corporate planning , Closely held corporations",ProQuest One Academic
Understanding How to Make the Best of the Worst of Times,"Follett discusses the importance in understanding how to make the best of the worst of times. Markets rise and fall, but when they fall at an unprecedented rate and then rise just as quickly, it's difficult to make sense of what's going on. These circumstances are further compounded by the fact that many don't know how the drivers of the market--namely, the coronavirus crisis and resulting economic damage--will resolve. Timing the market requires two right decisions: when to leave and when to reenter. People see the cost of missing out on the rebound, but staying invested and disciplined during a historic market correction, global pandemic, and recession--all happening concurrently--is easier said than done. When the Dow posted its five largest daily point losses in history within the span of 10 days, many investors may have felt as if their portfolios were in free fall. The obvious solution was to pull the rip cord and open their parachute. The ensuing panic seemed to overshadow all notions of preparing a proper strategy in advance to achieve as soft a landing as possible, given the unpredictable nature of the market and the idea that what goes up must come down.","Follett, Nick", Journal Article,Aug,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," COVID-19 , Pandemics , Investment , Investors , Economic crisis , Recessions , Economic impact",ProQuest One Academic
Navigating Client Relationships During COVID-19,"Brady et al discuss the navigation of client relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are vast, touching multiple areas of people's lives and finances. During volatile times, it is especially important for financial advisers to actively maintain their client relationships. While the pandemic is truly unprecedented, there may be lessons from a recent period of volatility, the financial crisis of 2007--2009, that the financial industry can apply to the current situation. During the upheaval of the crisis, many advisers were able to demonstrate their value and retain clients even as they lost wealth as a result of the downturn. The value of building trust with clients may be especially important for relationships with older clients. Older clients who personally trust their advisers may be more likely to retain their services through stressful life events. Right now, people of all ages are looking for trusted sources of advice to help figure out how to navigate the financial upheaval of the pandemic while still working toward their longer-term plans and goals. One important component of navigating communication and outreach is understanding that clients' life stages and responsibilities may shape the concerns they have related to COVID-19.","Brady, Samantha;Miller, Julie, PhD;Balmuth, Alexa", Journal Article,Aug,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Pandemics , COVID-19 , Financial planners , Economic crisis , Volatility , Customer relations , Economic impact , Client relationships , Coronaviruses",ProQuest One Academic

That said, times like these serve as a catalyst to check in, rebalance, and reallocate portfolios, so it is a good time to revisit the discussion on active versus passive, noting there is a broad spectrum of approaches that escape this simple bifurcation of investment ideologies.

Saving in Roth Accounts and Making Roth Conversions before Retirement in Today's Low Tax Rates,"There is a strong possibility that tax rates will rise in the next few years by more than the tax rate increases that are already scheduled to occur in 2026 according to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And, due to the taxation of Social Security benefits and income-based Medicare premiums, many retirees will have substantially higher marginal tax rates in retirement than their then-current tax brackets. Here, Reichenstein recommends advice financial advisers can provide this year and perhaps the next few years to help clients--especially pre-retirement-age clients--take advantage of what his colleagues and him believe are today's temporarily relatively low tax rates. In the next few years, while tax rates are relatively low, pre-retirement-age investors should consider: (1) saving in tax-exempt accounts like a Roth 401(k) instead of tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k); and (2) making Roth conversions to fill today's relatively low tax brackets.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA", Commentary,Jul,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Tax rates , Tax Cuts & Jobs Act 2017-US , Roth 401k plans , Tax reform , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

This research identified the alignment and discordance between what non-retired investors value, and what financial advisers think their clients value. These insights show opportunities for advisers to better articulate their value and, in doing so, improve attraction, retention, and promote client satisfaction. Using an online platform, investors were asked to rank a set of 15 adviser attributes from most important to least important. Advisers were asked to rank the same attributes, predicting what they thought investors valued. Results show that both groups recognized that reaching financial goals is a top priority, with notable disagreements on how to achieve this. Investors underestimated the importance of behavioral coaching in helping them stay on course. Advisers underestimated the importance of tax-efficient strategies to their clients.","Murphy, Ryan O, PhD;Lamas, Samantha;Sin, Ray, PhD", Journal Article,Jul,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Studies , Client relationships , Investment advisors , Opportunity",ProQuest One Academic

Exploring the Financial Planning Decisions Related to Greater Access to Retirement Funds Via the CARES Act,"Tacchino explores the financial planning decisions related to greater access to retirement funds through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the US. In an effort to provide relief from the economic impact of the pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on Mar 27, 2020. The new law temporarily lifts strict rules pertaining to withdrawals from either an employer plan or an IRA, thus granting unprecedented access to these funds. The Act also temporarily opens the door to enhanced loans from an employer-provided retirement plan. Clients are given a window to make elections that may help pay bills that went wanting because of employment interruptions and help them to avoid high interest on credit card debt. Financial planners will be called on to assess the myriad implications that arise from the lenient distribution and loan rules.

Surviving a Bear Attack,"Back in the days when there were conferences to attend, I once heard football coach Lou Holtz say, pressure is something you feel when you are not prepared.

I mention this not to relive my glory days (I didn't really have any), but because it is a statement worth referring to as we manage through a true crisis and a nasty market environment. These aspects matter because being prepared does not eliminate all pressure, and unaddressed pressures can lead to poor choices and bad, even devastating results.

Not only are they concerned and caring for their own families, they are also concerned and caring for clients (sometimes hundreds of clients), as well as for their team members and their communities. As the journey toward a successful succession is not an eaasy one, business owners must have a significant investment of time and money.","Wyman, Timothy, CFP®, JD", Commentary,Jun,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment , Success , COVID-19 , Entrepreneurs , Succession planning , Corporate management",ProQuest One Academic
"Pausing Panic Personal, Professional, and Business Implications","We're living through unprecedented times, and it's having a major impact on our personal, professional, and businesses lives. These unprecedented times are akin to a catastrophic storm rolling toward you as you sit on the shore. This rolling storm is not a single wave but several waves with each wave striking fear, loss, grief, and anxiety. These waves are hitting the shores of financial planning firms. The first wave was the coronavirus itself as a global pandemic but local disruptor, or what economists call an exogenous shock. Our challenge is to adapt to these exogenous shocks, acknowledging that the emotional response is greater than just COVID-19 as a global pandemic. You may be wondering how you prepare for such uncertainty without the decision-making tools of a Monte Carlo analysis and even when epidemiologists discuss their models on television and then say, All models are wrong.","Martin, Wm Marty, PsyD", Commentary,Jun,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Pandemics , Anxieties , COVID-19 , Uncertainty , Coronaviruses",ProQuest One Academic

Is Your Return on People Fueling Business Success?,"We live in extraordinary and ever-changing times, but one thing remains constant: people are the true value. People drive client experience, new client acquisition, the culture, our top and bottom line revenues; people are fundamental to our success. Yet, we tend to focus so much time on the numbers, on return on investment, ROI, when in reality, it is ROP or return on people that will fuel our ultimate outcomes. High turnover, low productivity, frequent conflict, errors and mistakes, stagnation of growth and ideas--these are all low ROP indicators. In order to effect positive change and maximize your ROP, you must uncover the root cause of these symptoms. At least twice a year, get away from the office and spend time with each other incorporating a combination of fun, getting to know each other on a deeper level, and business-building activities. It is rarely the products, solutions, process, or numbers that create the distinction in a business; it is people.","Dale, Sarah E;Sheets, Krista S", Journal Article,Jun,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Success factors , Turnover , Return on investment , Stagnation , Productivity",ProQuest One Academic

Under the PSLF program, borrowers of eligible federal direct loans who have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan, while employed in a full-time public service job, may have the balance of the principal and interest due on the loans forgiven. The PSLF program requires borrowers to possess federal direct loans. These are loans issued under the William D.

The Effect of Student Loans on Parental Views of Education Financing,"College costs are increasing, and most students need to save or borrow to pay for education. Outstanding parental debt may affect the decision about how to fund their children's education. The purpose of this research is to investigate whether parents' own student loan balances affect their decision to save for their child(ren)'s college education via tax-advantaged education saving vehicles and if their debt affects their decision to take out loans on behalf of their child(ren) for educational purposes. According to this study, parents who are paying off their own student loan debt are less likely to invest in tax-advantaged accounts for their children's education. For financial planners, this research highlights the importance of advising parents who may have their own student loan debt to start saving in taxadvantaged vehicles early.","Martin, Terrance K, Jr, PhD;Augustin, Lua A V, PhD, CFP®;Ricaldi, Laura C, PhD;Nunez, Jose", Journal Article,Jun,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Student loans , College students , Higher education , Decision making , Student debt , Education",ProQuest One Academic

Portfolio Analysis in a Time of Chaos,"Janus Henderson partnered with the Journal of Financial Planning and FPA on their annual Trends in Investing Survey for the first time this year. Considering the extreme market volatility and economic uncertainty that dominated the first few months of 2020, it turned out to be a rather opportune period in which to be involved in this type of research. The survey's findings on asset allocation are especially telling: Overall, more than half (56.6 percent) of respondents said they typically reevaluate their asset allocation strategy based on the economy in general, while 51.7% do so based on market volatility. Amid extreme market turmoil, another helpful way to cut through the noise is to start at the beginning. The original target allocation set for an investor is what was determined to be that individual's optimal, long-term asset allocation. A portfolio drifted by market movement is, by definition, suboptimal, being underweight recent losers and overweight recent winners and adding, essentially, a momentum trade to the portfolio.","Hetts, Adam", Journal Article,Jun,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Polls & surveys , Resource allocation , Asset allocation , Volatility , Portfolio management",ProQuest One Academic

Your Digital Presence Is Being Tested in a Social Distancing World,"Everyone in the planet is now familiar with the concept of ""social distancing""--isolating yourself in order to slow the spread of a contagious disease, and this behavior is critically important in a coronavirus (COVID-19) world. Unfortunately, some financial planners have for years practiced what Henebry calls ""digital distancing""--the act of isolating yourself or your company by not having a meaningful digital presence. Digital distancing could prove fatal in a world where social distancing has brought traditional face-to-face interactions to a standstill. The tide is out, and your digital presence is being tested. The remedy for self-limiting digital distancing habits is simply embracing digital transformation. This involves: (1) changing your mindset; (2) creating new content; and then (3) delivering it regularly through social media platforms like LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.","Henebry, Bobby, CFA", Commentary,May,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," COVID-19 , Social distancing , Financial planners , Social networks , Coronaviruses",ProQuest One Academic

Net gain on investment should be a deciding factor when considering account type and structure for our clients. It seems clear (barring significant extenuating circumstances) that Indianans saving for a future college expense should select a 529 plan as the preferred vehicle because of the state's significant tax credit, which drives a 10-year tax alpha of 4.16% on annual contributions of $3,000.

"The Financial Impact of Not Using 529 Plans, and Behavioral Interventions to Increase Usage","American families are leaving an estimated $237 billion on the table by not investing their college savings in 529 plans under normal market conditions. Under adverse market conditions, the missed opportunity is $33 billion. Under normal market conditions, the primary benefit for most families from using a 529 plan is not its tax advantages; it is the fact that it encourages investing instead of using a savings account. Middle- and upper-middle-class families stand to benefit the most from increased adoption of 529 plans (and other investing vehicles). The average family saving for college would see a benefit of $4,044 per child. The focus of this paper is on the use of 529s for college savings--their intended purpose before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act broadened the allowable purposes of 529s to include K-12 education.

Those heirs can withdraw the assets over the 10-year period or withdraw it all at 10 years. Previously, the stretch IRA permitted an heir to defer IRA contributions over long periods of time, deferring income tax.

Anatomy of an Exquisite Meeting: Introducing a 6-Step Model to Build Trust and Commitment,"Communication is at the heart of elevating a client's perception of quality care--and that perception significantly influences the client's level of trust and commitment.

The good news is that robo-advisers cannot do what personal financial planners can--that is, help clients connect their money and financial decisions with their unique life, their goals, and their values.

Got Culture? Your Firm's Success Depends on It,"Your firm's culture impacts your business in the following ways and so many more: attraction and retention of staff and clients; client experience; brand and public image; reputation in the community; productivity and profitability; and enjoyment in your career. Culture is commonly defined as a way of life of groups of people, meaning the way they do things--their behaviors, beliefs, values, and symbols that they accept without even thinking about them, that are passed along by communication and imitation. In a commoditized industry, the challenge is not doing business with people who need what you have (that's obvious); rather, it's doing business with people who believe what you believe. Your team members, clients, prospects, and community must know your beliefs and principles; those principles are the foundation of your culture, not merely words with no actions. The challenge of sustaining your company culture is that beliefs, words, behaviors, and actions must be consistent and in alignment.","Dale, Sarah E;Sheets, Krista S", Journal Article,Mar,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Business community , Success factors , Financial planning , Corporate culture",ProQuest One Academic
Are Your Wealthy Clients at Risk with Mass-Market Insurance?,"Consider the client whose adult life and career started normally, but then they flourished and became wealthy. Now they own multiple homes, enjoy the lifestyle financial success can bring, and perhaps they even attract media attention. With increasing success, their financial planning needs evolve, too. They look beyond 401(k)s for a broader set of investment alternatives, and eventually they seek the help of a financial planner who can manage the complexity and scale of their financial needs. Financial planners can help clients and simultaneously protect assets under management by developing a strong relationship with an insurance professional who is experienced in working with financially successful clients and who has excellent relationships with insurers that specialize in high-net-worth clients. Annual risk assessments of new and ongoing exposures are critical, especially for wealthy clients. Just as important is for the insurance/risk management professional to be competent and experienced in topics relevant to the needs of wealthy clients.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®, CLU®;Layfield, Cliff, CIC, ARM", Commentary,Mar,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Client relationships , Wealth management , Risk management , Property & casualty insurance , Wealth , Affluence",ProQuest One Academic
Introducing the Longevity Portfolio,"Annuities with benefit payments linked to inflation (i.e., real annuities) have long been regarded as the optimal financial product for retirees because they provide income that is guaranteed for life and are linked to expected future changes in retiree spending, such as inflation. However, real annuities--as well as virtually all other types of annuities--remain relatively unpopular among retirees today, both in the US and globally, an effect commonly referred to as the ""annuity puzzle."" Funding retirement with a traditional portfolio creates an imperfect hedge, since it subjects the retiree to the possibility of outliving savings, commonly referred to as longevity risk. Investment approaches that explicitly consider the risk structure of a goal (i.e., the liability) are generally referred to as liability-driven investing (LDI). While LDI has become increasingly common among pension plans, it is not widely used when creating household retirement portfolios. One reason for this is that pension liabilities have relatively known payments, while individual expenses can vary significantly.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®", Journal Article,Mar,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Professional liability , Retirement planning , Annuities , Pension plans , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

The Difference a Day Can Make: Exploring Another Variable of Interest for EIAs,"Academics and practitioners have developed a robust literature examining the suitability and use of equity index annuities (EIAs). EIAs are complex structured products designed to allow investors to limit downside risk while simultaneously participating when equity markets rise, the characteristics of which are not always readily understood. As described by Collins, Lam, and Stampfli (2009), EIAs are ""fiendishly difficult to understand"". They come with myriad contract characteristics, many that can be changed at the behest of the issuer, making meaningful comparisons across products a challenge. As a result, determining the suitability of an EIA as part of an investment portfolio or retirement plan remains a complex task. Here, Fraser and Payne highlight the daily variability of interest credited to an EIA based on the anniversary date. Essentially, the results of this research suggest there is an aspect of market timing with these products.","Fraser, Steve P, PhD;Payne, Brian C, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,Mar,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Investment , Equity indexed annuities",ProQuest One Academic

Using Roth Conversions to Add Value to Higher-Income Retirees' Financial Portfolios,"Reichenstein and Meyer discuss the integration of Roth conversions to add value to higher-income retirees' financial portfolios. Financial advisers provide their clients important support, knowledge, encouragement, and guidance to achieve their financial goals. Research shows that advisers can also provide considerable value to clients' bottom line, their portfolios. A 2013 paper by Morningstar researchers introduced the concept of gamma to quantify how smarter financial planning decisions can add value to clients' portfolios. How financial advisers can add value specifically to middle-income households accounts are explained by adjusting when they begin their Social Security benefits and by recommending a tax-efficient withdraw strategy from their financial portfolio.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA;Meyer, William", Journal Article,Feb,2020,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement income , Financial planning , Portfolio management , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Analyzing the Effects of Aggressive Rebalancing During Bear Markets,"From the first day one considers in earnest the subject of investing, it is clear that selling out of stocks after a significant decline is almost universally described as a bad move for long-term investors. Even if someone gets back into the market at a lower price point after exiting, that success encourages further speculations of what the market may do next, resulting in additional bets for bigger and bigger sums of money until being wrong costs dearly. Safe withdrawal rate and portfolio sustainability studies typically assume that portfolios are rebalanced, usually annually, regardless of market behavior. For diversified portfolios, during a bear market, the conventional wisdom seems to be that selling is bad, holding is okay, and rebalancing is better.

College Savers: What Is the Expected Tax Alpha of 529 Plans?,"529 plans offer tax advantages, however they come with more complexity in account set-up, fewer investment options, potentially higher fees, and less flexibility than a taxable account. This research looks at whether the tax advantages provided by 529 plans are too good to pass up. The relative tax advantage of 529 plans also depends on the length of time the client has until college, whether the contributions will be gradual or in a lump sum, and the assumed rate of return on the investments. This analysis calculates a tax alpha on a state-by-state basis as a reference guide for planners who work across many states to help make an initial assessment of whether the 529 plan offers relatively large or small tax advantages versus a taxable account. This can allow a planner to quantify the relative tax benefit of a 529 plan versus a taxable account for college savings, depending on the home state of the client.","Delorme, Luke, CFP®", Journal Article,Nov,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Investments , Taxation , Lump sum , Qualified tuition programs , Tax planning",ProQuest One Academic

Refunds were generally lower for taxpayers who made less than $100k, according to an article in MarketWatch, ""IRS Data: Rich Americans Received Bigger Tax Refunds Under Trump's New Tax Law."" And because of that, they did not adjust the withholding amounts on their paychecks. The Wall Street Journal reported that those who made between $100k and $250k were less likely to get a refund and more likely to pay money, however those making between $250k and $500k saw refunds rise by 11 percent from the previous tax year.

It seems that when it comes to what clients feel about their taxes after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we might be dealing with a classic case of loss aversion. Even though many clients realized slightly higher paychecks because less was withheld, many felt the sting of the loss of the big refund check more than the joy of the small monthly bump in their paycheck.

The 50th anniversary of what? Unlike most professions, ours can actually point to a precise founding date: December 12, 1969, when Loren Dunton convened a group of financial services executives at a Chicago hotel to discuss the possibilities for a new way of delivering financial advice. Out of that gathering came the seeds of what would become FPA and CFP Board. After the Chicago confab, however, there was the possibility of talking to one adviser who could make recommendations that spanned all those silos, melded their possibilities, and offered integrated solutions. Financial planning has always been interdisciplinary and is now expanding to include coaching, facilitation, and financial therapy. Humanistic skills are required if you seek to counsel human beings. Gratifyingly, our academic programs are evolving and expanding to teach these skills in a formal, research-based environment that offers insights from the fields of behavioral finance, communication theory, and counseling psychology.","Yeske, Dave, DBA, CFP", Journal Article,Oct,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Professions , Counseling psychology , Behavior , Overspending , Chicago Illinois , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Protecting Against Elder Exploitation,"As baby boomers continue to retire and advance in age, increasing numbers of elderly Americans are at significant risk of falling prey to schemes targeted at separating them from their money. Cases of elder abuse frequently go unreported, since the victims are often ashamed or unable to speak up. While many seniors have the mental acuity to safeguard their assets, the combination of cognitive decline and accumulated wealth make some other seniors vulnerable to financial crimes. As a financial planner, how can you optimally guide your senior clients, who have diminished financial capacity and decisional abilities, on recognizing the warning signs? Finally, consider consolidating investment accounts, if possible, to make your elderly clients' finances more manageable. Be sure to maintain your clients' beneficiary designations according to their wishes. Simplifying money management will make it easier for you and your clients' loved ones to spot any unusual withdrawals so that you can swiftly avoid potential financial fraud.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP®, CTFA, AEP®;Badillo, Deborah, CFP®", Journal Article,Oct,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Investment , Assets , Wealth , Money , Baby boomers",ProQuest One Academic

A total of 102 subjects participated in the three stages of the study, providing pre-session, post-session, and three-week follow-up data. Immediately after the session, the group that received the financial psychology session showed statistically significant increases in their readiness to save, confidence in their ability to save more, financial satisfaction, and financial health.

Lay the Foundation for the Next Generation of Ownership,"Earlier this year, FP Transitions published the Trends in Transactions and Valuations Study, which reviewed valuation data and growth trends for independent financial advisers. One of the most important observations was that firms with a multi-generational ownership structure reported the highest year-over-year revenue growth rate compared to single-owner practices or businesses owned by peers. Firms with multi-generational ownership also showed more diverse client age demographics. In fact, the underlying data supported the conclusion that the single most important investment a growth-minded practice owner can make is to recruit and retain the next generation of advisers. A stepping stone to building a multigenerational business is to create an internship program. FP Transitions has worked with small firms, starting below $1 million in revenue, who used an annual internship as a successful feeder program into their entry-level positions. Recruiting and retaining the next generation of professionals can take time and finesse, and yet the benefits are clear: stronger growth, broader client base, and an eventual solution to the succession problem when the relationship advances.","Sjölin, Christine", Journal Article,Oct,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Transitions , Ownership , Investment , Internships , Trends",ProQuest One Academic

One issue associated with such state of flux has to do with defining financial planning and the second issue is determining whether financial planning is indeed a profession. Chief financial planner Charles G. Hughes argued in a 1988 article that it is neither a lack of definition for financial planning nor a lack of being considered a profession that posed a problem, rather it was a lack of financial planning having a conscience.

Managing to Target: Dynamic Adjustments for Accumulation Strategies,"Casual evidence suggests that many individuals do not have a clear financial plan to build a retirement portfolio. Most people do not even have a target value for such a portfolio on the retirement date, a figure often referred to as ""the number"". This may be because ""the number"" depends on both life expectancy and the cost of the desired lifestyle during retirement, neither of which individuals may find easy to forecast, particularly in the early stages of their working years. Here, Estrada outlines a financial plan to hit the target amount for a retirement portfolio, compares a static strategy of sticking to the plan to dynamic strategies that make adjustments to the plan along the way, and proposes a way to evaluate investment strategies for the accumulation period in order to determine the best course of action.","Estrada, Javier, PhD", Journal Article,Aug,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Retirement , Retirement planning , Portfolio management",ProQuest One Academic
Even Cowboys Need Financial Advisers: What We Can Learn from Songwriters,"McManus shares some insights from a panel discussion of songwriters at a business development conference in Nashville, as well as key takeaways for financial advisers looking to grow their practices. It was a fascinating conversation for many reasons--not least because the music industry is facing challenges and transitions that parallel those in the financial services industry. The music folks on the panel discussed the power of video and Instagram to enhance the music experience, as well as concerts and social media. The more the listeners know about the artists, their music, and the stories behind the songs, the larger the artists' following and the more enjoyable the fans' experience. It's the same for financial advisers. Your clients love to hear the personal stories about what you and your family are doing, just as you delight in hearing what's going on in their lives. The people--and their stories--come first, and that's how you forge deeper connections.","McManus, Kristine, CRPC®", Journal Article,Aug,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Songwriters , Financial planners , Music industry , Client relationships , Financial services , Social networks , Music , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Use Accountable Plans to Retain Benefits of Lost Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions,"A ""working condition fringe benefit"" is any property or service provided to an employee to the extent that, if the employee paid for the property or service, the amount paid would be allowable as a trade or business expense. Similar to employer-provided medical or life insurance benefits, working condition fringe benefits are excluded from the employee's gross income for income tax purposes, not subject to employment taxes, yet deductible by the employer. By reducing the employee's taxable pay for work-related expenses the employee would otherwise pay after-tax, the employer is: increasing the employee's after-tax cash flow; reducing the FICA obligation of the employer; and increasing the employee's morale and commitment to the employer. Here, Gardner and Welch discuss how cash reimbursement of work-related expenses could qualify as a working condition fringe benefit and detail the pros and cons of fringe benefit plans.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, RLP®, CFP®;Welch, Julie A, CPA, PFS, CFP®", Journal Article,Jul,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Reimbursement , Taxes , Perquisites , Costs",ProQuest One Academic

Who Is Investing in ETFs? Exploring the Role of Investor Knowledge,"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are registered investment vehicles ranging in design from tracking an index, commodity, investment style, or non-US market to providing exposure to particular industries or investment vehicles. Investing in an ETF product rather than a mutual fund product offers a number of benefits; the most notable being lower capital gain tax payments, lower fees, and improved liquidity. ETF investors should expect to pay lower capital gain tax payments than mutual funds, given their trading structure. In addition, ETF investors should expect to pay lower fees since accounting costs are determined at the shareholder level, rather than fund level. ETFs do not have load fees, and ETFs do not have 12b-1 fees. And ETFs provide investors an additional liquidity benefit, because ETFs share prices allow for intraday values, whereas mutual funds are only priced once-per-day at their net asset value. Here, Enete et al examine the relationship between investor characteristics and ETF ownership by exploring the role of investor knowledge, financial advice-seeking, and fee aversion for ETF ownership.","Enete, Shane, CFA;Reiter, Miranda, CFP®;Usrey, Wendy;Scott, Andrew;Seay, Martin, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,Jul,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Investments , Investors , Exchange traded funds , Investment policy , Capital gains , Advantages",ProQuest One Academic

Wagner and Kinder each went on to individually write several more Money and Soul columns through the 1990s on topics ranging from building a relationship of trust with clients, to exploring your own money values and personality. As the profession evolved, so did the Money and Soul column. In the 2000s, the column was written by various venerable voices, including psychotherapists Eileen Gallo, Ph.D., and Courtney Pullen; planning pioneer Lewis Walker; life planning guru Mitch Anthony; and well-known planners Ross Levin and Roy Diliberto. In a Sep 2004 Money and Soul column, Courtney Pullen, building on concepts first suggested by Wagner, introduced planners to ""integral finance"" by proposing that planners apply psychology expert Ken Wilber's ""theory of everything"" to the planning process. In short, Pullen simply suggested a way to help clients look at all aspects of financial planning.","Schulaka, Carly", Commentary,Jul,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Journals , Planning , Alliances , Affluence , Wagner, Dick , Kinder, George",ProQuest One Academic

As such, more planning professionals are practicing goals-based or goals-centric financial planning.

"Effective Socially Responsible Investing: Self-Proclamation, Sustainability Rating, and Cost","Millennial investors are at the forefront of burgeoning interest in socially responsible investing, or SRI, which has evolved to stand for sustainable, responsible, and impact investing. Hundreds of mutual funds now carry some sort of SRI label, but many of these funds are socially conscious in name only. This study reveals the correlation between Morningstar's GLOBE-denoted sustainability rating and its star rating, which provides an estimation of the relative investment performance of these selections. Risk-adjusted return measures and sustainability metrics were found to be uncorrelated. Self-proclaimed socially responsible funds (SPSRFs) do not materially differ from non-SPSRFs in terms of their sustainability measures or return performance. Within the sustainability funds universe, it is possible to earn better returns by simply avoiding those funds with higher expense ratios. Investors should be aware that about 20 percent of SPSRFs don't live up to their self-proclamation. Furthermore, both SPSRFs and non-SPSRFs with lower expense ratios have higher Morningstar star ratings.

How to Position Bond Portfolios in an Inverting Rate Environment and an Impending Recession,"Individual investors rarely give much thought to their fixed income holdings. Financial planners help their clients stick to the risk-appropriate overall asset allocation, and then often focus largely on equities. Yet, as more investors near or enter retirement, the investment horizon shrinks. The tactical shifts matter more and they hold more dollars in fixed income. Therefore, the returns and the risk profile of fixed income matter more. Here, Dubil discusses fixed income strategies in view of impending recessions. He examines whether a long-to-short shift makes sense, and if so, how to best implement it.","Dubil, Robert, PhD", Journal Article,Apr,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Retirement , Bond portfolios , Fixed incomes , Recessions",ProQuest One Academic

"Financially Sound Households Use Financial Planners, Not Transactional Advisers","Households are becoming increasingly responsible for myriad financial decisions, such as determining how much to save for retirement, how to invest those savings, when to retire, etc. Given the complexity of these decisions and the general lack of financial literacy among US households, financial advisers should seemingly be well-positioned to help improve household financial decision-making. Indeed, a growing body of theoretical research has noted the potential value of financial advisers in a variety of domains; however empirical evidence on the topic is mixed and generally suggests households with financial advisers do no better (or even worse) than those without, especially in investment-related domains. Here, Blanchett utilizes the six most recent waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (2001 to 2016) to show the potential value of financial planners, not transactional advisers, in helping households make the best financial decisions.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®", Journal Article,Apr,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Households , Financial planning , Financial literacy , Wealth management , Decision making",ProQuest One Academic

(Nearly) Broke and Trying to Change the World,"Smith argues that despite preliminary perceptions of millennials as entitled, many of them decided a long time ago that making a difference in the world was more important to them than being wealthy. So they set themselves on a challenging career path that would allow them to do their part to change the world. They like to be of service. They want to help. That doesn't mean, however, that they want or deserve unnecessary financial stress, exorbitant debt, or to default on their mortgage. No reasonable person, however saintly, wants that. Furthermore, student loans are just a piece of the financial anxiety puzzle for millennials working in public service.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Employer-Provided Student Loan Repayment Assistance Programs,This paper analyzes employer-provided student loan repayment assistance programs to determine their overall effectiveness for clients who are federal student loan borrowers. Borrowers who have a manageable student loan balance and are planning on paying off their federal student loans on the standard 10-year repayment plan can benefit from employers providing student loan repayment assistance programs. Borrowers who have a high debt-to-income ratio and are planning on receiving loan forgiveness under an income-driven repayment plan should consider negotiating for additional compensation or additional employer-provided retirement plan contributions instead of participating in an employer's student loan repayment assistance program. Borrowers who will qualify for public service loan forgiveness should negotiate for additional compensation or decline participating in the employer's student loan repayment assistance program unless the employer's assistance is not considered taxable income to the employee.,"Riskin, Ross A, CPA/PFS, CCFC", Journal Article,Feb,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Student loans , Effectiveness , Financial planners , Repayments , Employers",ProQuest One Academic
A Different Angle on Insurance and Financial Planners,"In general, casinos set their payoffs so that the bettor's probability of winning, multiplied by the payoff on the bet, is less than the amount of the bet. In other words, on average they pay out less than the amount of the bet. How much less they're willing to pay out is dependent on competitive pressures, marketing, and advertising, like dancing fountains and flaming artificial volcanos. Now consider the humble life of an insurance company. Like the casino, it operates on the principle of large numbers and deals with mathematical odds. Casino odds are strictly mathematical. The probability of rolling a seven with two dice is exactly one-sixth, for example, and it is the same for everyone.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®, CLU®", Journal Article,Feb,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Probability , Casinos , Insurance companies",ProQuest One Academic
Developing Leaders with Reverse Mentoring,"At an industry conference recently, I was reminded how powerful reverse mentoring is for leadership development.

Reverse mentoring is easy to implement. The concept is structured so that a senior and junior member (not necessarily from the same organizational group) meet regularly for a planned discussion. Each meeting has an agenda set by the junior member. If the pair is having a hard time coming up with discussion topics, they can adopt a business case to solve together. It is helpful to have a program coordinator who can monitor how the pair is working together and help when needed.","Smith, David F, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,Feb,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Mentoring programs , Leadership training , Financial planners , Computer assisted instruction--CAI",ProQuest One Academic
Investigating the Role of Whole Life Insurance in a Lifetime Financial Plan,"Financial advisers with an investment emphasis may commonly suggest that pre-retirement life insurance needs are best met by using a ""buy term and invest the difference"" strategy that pays the smallest premiums for a temporary death benefit, allowing more assets to be invested. Investments, however, may not be ideally suited for managing the full range of post-retirement financial risks, including longevity risk, market volatility, and spending shocks. This study considers whole life insurance as an alternative to ""buy term and invest the difference"" as part of a lifetime financial plan. Three possible uses of whole life insurance in a lifetime financial plan for a hypothetical couple, both age 40, are investigated. The analyses suggest that integrating whole life insurance into a lifetime financial plan has the potential to allow a given asset base to support greater lifetime spending and greater legacy than ""buy term and invest the difference"" strategies.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Journal Article,Feb,2019,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Whole life , Insurance policies , Life insurance , Death benefits",ProQuest One Academic

Over the years, at our fee-only RIA, we've learned that many people don't fully understand the FAFSA or its purpose. And those misunderstandings can cost them. Here are the top three misconceptions about the FAFSA: 1. Only people who expect need-based aid must fill out the form. 2. It's a pain to fill out, so put it off until you have more free time. 3.

But when it comes to helping your clients maximize college financial aid for their children, it can be used to their advantage. Many complexities are associated with clients sending their child off to college. Perhaps the biggest factor that keeps parents up at night is the cost of college. Unfortunately, at $25,000 per year for many in-state public institutions to $50,000 a year or more at private institutions, a four-year education can approximate that of a small starter house. Multiply that by two or three kids, and the cost approximates that of a very nice house.

FAFSA Facts,"A few important issues are frequently faced by financial planners who help their clients fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

This article will explore these topics and provide financial planners tips for ensuring the FAFSA is completed correctly. When a dependent student's parents are divorced or separated, only one parent is responsible for completing the FAFSA. The FAFSA treats legal and informal separation the same as divorce. When married parents claim head of household status on their federal tax returns, it is almost always incorrect.

Any approach balancing the priorities of lifetime sustainability and maximum income generation must successfully navigate challenging market conditions at various times, likely both early and later in retirement.

Retirement Income Literacy: A Key to Sustainable Retirement Planning,"In 2014, the first iteration of the RICP Retirement Income Literacy Survey was used to test the retirement income literacy of Americans nearing or already in retirement. The initial data found the mean respondent score was 17.12 correct out of 38 questions, or an average score of 45% (Hopkins and Littell 2016). In 2017, the survey was re-run with new respondents and yielded similar results: retirement-age Americans (ages 60-75) had the same low rate of retirement income literacy as they did three years prior. Some areas of knowledge showed slight improvement; however, only 26% of retirement-age Americans passed the literacy quiz with a score of 60% or higher, indicating a lack of retirement income planning knowledge.

Brace for the Third Wave of Financial Planning,"Over the past 30 years, financial planning methods have evolved so synchronously with the supporting software itself that financial institutions both large and small often find themselves discussing their planning strategy within the rigid confines of the technology that supports it. That's not how it should work, and it is certain to change in the coming years. Industry experts have been speculating about what's next for financial planning for several years now, but financial planning still hasn't been the consumer-dictated marketplace for disruption that many had speculated it would be. In many ways, planning continues to be a service reserved for the mass-affluent and high-net-worth individuals of the world. What is certain is that $68 trillion dollars is currently moving from a guaranteed book of business to one that will be increasingly up for grabs.

Because the 4% rule does not include taxes and fees. Thus, when fees, say 1%, are added along with taxes, the 4% rule actually becomes the 5.2% rule, and that's assuming your client is in the 12% tax bracket.

How to Create Content that Connects with Your Ideal Client,"Many financial planners struggle when it comes to content marketing. Creating content can be time-consuming, but it's worth the effort. Studies have shown that content marketing costs 62% less than traditional marketing and generates approximately three times as many leads. With data like that, it's impossible to ignore original content when putting together your financial planning practice's marketing plan. The problem that financial planners often face when trying their hand at content marketing is simple: they're stuck in ""creation"" mode and don't have a strategy to back it up. When you start to build a content plan, you need to know who you're creating for. Some financial planning topics are going to resonate with you, but they may fall flat with your audience. If you find yourself straying from your values as a financial planner, or from creating content that holds your interest, you're doing it wrong.

Annuity Fables,"Back in 1993, I had absolutely no idea how a life annuity provided insurance against outliving wealth. It wasn't part of my curriculum in business school or the established cannon in graduate courses on econometrics, microeconomics, and derivative pricing. Even to this day, a proper understanding of annuities is not part of the formal educational curriculum for most college and university students in finance, economics, and business. Now, fast forward 25 years later, and I personally have atoned for my own ignorance but continue to come across large groups of educated professionals with CFPs, CFAs, MBAs, and Ph.D.s who, similar to mini-me, don't quite understand the role of annuities in ensuring you have enough money for the rest of your life.

Changes to Charitable Giving and Year-End Strategies,"In advance of the holiday and year-end giving season, this column reviews changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and suggests strategies for taxpayers who receive little or no tax benefit from their charitable giving. The TCJA made three major changes to the charitable contribution deduction. First, for cash contributions, the prior-law 50% of adjusted gross income (AGI) limitation on deductible charitable contributions for the current year increased to 60 percent of AGI from 2018 through 2025. Although tax savings is not the primary reason many taxpayers make charitable contributions, changes made by the TCJA may still have an adverse effect on charitable giving. Generally, to receive a tax deduction for charitable giving, an individual must itemize deductions. From 2018 through 2025, the Tax Policy Center projects nine out of 10 individuals will claim the standard deduction, thanks to the new $12,000 standard deduction, the elimination of miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor, and the state and local tax deduction cap of $10,000.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP®;Brannon, John, CFP®, CTP", Journal Article,Dec,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Fiscal policy , Charitable tax deductions , Donations , Tax deductions , Tax reform , Charities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Future Trends: Generational Realities and the Growth of Our Profession,"Year 2018 marked 45 years since 35 men and women graduated as the first class from the College for Financial Planning.

Of those who founded or joined practices in the 1970s and early 1980s, some have passed away, some are retired, and many are on the cusp of transition. As the ownership and employee base ages, succession and continuity planning are a ""front-of-mind"" imperative. Gen-Xers have been the successors, by and large, to boomer owners, and Gen Y is being groomed as successors to the successors.

Understanding Social Security Claiming Decisions Using Survey Evidence,"Although research shows that there are large gains in lifetime wealth from delaying Social Security claiming, most people claim at or before full retirement age. An original, nationally representative survey was fielded to gain insight into people's rationales for their Social Security claiming decisions, their satisfaction with their past claiming decisions, and how they financed any gap between retirement and claiming. Common rationales for claiming Social Security before full retirement age included stopping work, liquidity, poor health, and concerns about future benefit cuts due to policy changes. Claiming upon stopping work and claiming at full retirement age appeared to be viewed as social norms. Individuals who claimed at full retirement age were more satisfied with their claiming decisions than individuals who claimed early or delayed. There was little evidence that claiming decisions and rationales for claiming were correlated with financial literacy or knowledge of Social Security rules.","Shoven, John B, PhD;Slavov, Sita Nataraj, PhD;Wise, David A, PhD", Journal Article,Nov,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Decision making , Financial literacy , Social security , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic

A Road Map to Estate Planning after Tax Reform,"The Tax Cuts and Job Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, is complex and impacts numerous tax specializations, including individual, corporate, and international planning. Of course, estate planning has also been impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Although transfer tax changes made by tax reform are few, the doubling of the exclusion amount with a sunset will significantly affect estate planning for the next eight years. In 2026, the basic exclusion amount reverts to the 2017 amount of approximately $5.49 million, adjusted for inflation between now and then using the slower, newly enacted chained-CPI approach. In other words, the donor's holding period for and income tax basis in gifted property generally carry over to the donee, and the decedent's income tax basis in property passed to heirs steps up or down to the property's value on the date of death or the alternate valuation date six months later.

Never has it been so important for financial planners to incorporate a review of their client's tax return into the planning process. Almost every recommendation made has the potential to swing tax results for better or worse; and being strategic is critical as the nuances of the TCJA become more familiar. Alimony is changing. Under the old laws, the payor of alimony could deduct payments from their income tax return. Recipients would in turn report that income on their tax return. This income was treated like earned income for the purpose of contributing to an IRA. Deductions for charitable donations may no longer benefit those not itemizing. Be aware that anyone receiving a required minimum distribution can divert all or a portion of that distribution directly to the charity.","Wenger, Julia Brufke, CFP®, ChFC®, EA", Journal Article,Nov,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Alimony , Tax returns , Tax reform , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Annuitized Income and Optimal Equity Allocation,Prior studies have confirmed that annuitized income such as Social Security or a pension increases the optimal stock allocation of a household's investment portfolio. Buying an income annuity should change the optimal allocation of the remaining investment portfolio. This analysis helps advisers understand how much the remaining equity allocation should change when an annuity is purchased. This paper used current annuity and bond prices to estimate the optimal equity allocation for retirees with varying levels of guaranteed income who have higher and lower preference for income stability and bequests. Results indicate that increasing annuitized income has a strong impact on optimal equity allocation in the remaining investment portfolio. Results suggest that advisers considering recommending the purchase of an income annuity should primarily draw from bond assets to maintain an appropriate risk level for the investor's total wealth.,"Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®;Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,Nov,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Investment pools , Portfolio investments , Social security , Retirees , Equity , Investments",ProQuest One Academic
How to Deduct Home Office Expenses under Tax Reform,"In this world of technology and constant connectivity, working remotely has become more common. Either as an employee or as a self-employed person, a home office can provide convenience, flexibility, and a lower overhead.

However, the home office deduction is eliminated under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), because miscellaneous itemized deductions have been axed. To make up for significant cuts to deductions, the TCJA doubled the standard deduction available to individuals: $24,000 for married couples filing jointly; $12,000 for single filers; and $18,000 for those qualifying for head of household status in 2018.

Realizing the Essential Leadership Role of a Financial Life Planner,"Financial life planning is at its best and most effective when a planner facilitates a defined process on behalf of a motivated and fully engaged client. However, before the client reaches the level of trust and comfort needed for a high-quality engagement, he or she instinctually assumes, ascribes, and expects a certain set of traits and behaviors from the planner. Those client assumptions are based on a range of factors tied to the client's personal history and to the many potential roles that can be filled by a financial life planner. Based on that perspective and recent research1, recognizing the leadership role and its accompanying responsibilities is a major step toward creating better financial planners and more effective and impactful planning engagements. Understanding the leadership requirements inherent in a financial planning engagement provides a basis by which planners can personally benchmark their leadership capabilities. With that knowledge, planners can endeavor to improve their leadership capabilities and increase their effectiveness.","Brody, Stephen C, CFP®, ChFC®, RLP®, EdD", Journal Article,Nov,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Leadership , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Expand Your Definition of Ownership,"In the last five years, hundreds of financial professionals have taken a different approach to advancing their careers and become minority owners in existing businesses. Despite this, founders and successors alike may hold biases that cause them to overlook suitable candidates and sound opportunities. How one defines ownership frames the assumptions they make when envisioning the path forward: some next-generation advisers are doggedly determined to relive the experience of the early founders in order to prove their mettle; others rule out ownership because they don't want the headache of running a business. Taking a limited view can block viable possibilities. Expanding your definition of ownership can open your path forward -- and be the key that solves the succession problem. At MiyeWire LLC, a boutique planning firm in Reston, VA, ownership means formalizing a shared goal and identity.

Females represent an untapped opportunity; 53% do not have a financial adviser, and 67% feel misunderstood by their financial adviser. Recognizing this gap, many financial services companies, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Prudential Financial, and TD Ameritrade, are studying the investment behavior of women in hopes of acquiring these important investors as new clients. Additionally, many industry organizations have launched efforts to attract more females into the adviser profession.

Mining the Gold That Is Your Introvert Employee,"Ii is estimated that fully 50% of the working population in the US is somewhat to highly introverted. This means that it is possible that half of the valuable employees at a financial planning firm prefer to not be on committees, prefer to not go to conferences, prefer to work alone, prefer to think about ideas for quite a while, and prefer to avoid conflict, especially in groups. Introversion can be confused with shyness; it is not shyness. Introversion is a person's preferred style of working with ideas, people, and the world. Shyness is an anxiety challenge. It's likely that in planning firms you will find greater than 50% introverts, as the financial planning community naturally attracts people with these preferences.

No Compensation Model Is Conflict Free,"In September, FPA Chair Shannon Pike, CFP, wrote an article in InvestmentNews titled ""Focus on Competency, Not Compensation Method."" My initial reaction to it was one of some discontent, considering I had intentionally sought to work with a fee-only financial planning firm from the start. I was convinced that fee-only financial planning firms were the pinnacle of the profession and only fee-only firms were capable of providing truly conflict-free advice! Subsequently to that first career move, I have continued with intention to work for what I long considered to be the most conflict-free model available in my view -- fee-only. As my experience in the profession has expanded, and the individuals with whom I have had the opportunity to discuss the future of our profession with has broadened, it is clear to me that fee-only does not equal ""conflict-free,"" let alone fiduciary.","Harvey, Ian, CFP®", Journal Article,Oct,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Models , Compensation , Conflicts of interest , Fiduciaries , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Cultivating Emotional Intelligence for the Future of the Profession,"Emotional intelligence, a concept stemming from the 1995 Daniel Goleman book Emotional Intelligence, is a person's ability to manage their emotions and relationships successfully. According to Goleman in his 2004 Harvard Business Review article, ""What Makes a Great Leader,"" emotional intelligence has five elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skill. Emotional intelligence in both leaders and in new hires is key in keeping the financial planning profession one of high-quality client-first service, especially in an age where technology will only become more prevalent. Examine yourself as a leader and see where you may lag and could improve, because unlike IQ, EQ can be learned if you're motivated to do so.

CRACKING THE CODE: A Blueprint for How to Work with Millennial Clients,"Many financial planning firms today are trying to determine how to develop relationships with their clients' adult children. The challenge is often found when a planning firm tries to deliver the same experience to these young clients as they deliver to the parents. We believe the key to being successful with this demographic group is to deliver a simplified, technology-enabled, education-focused, valuable offering that fits the needs of the client, rather than just trying to replicate the same time-intensive financial life planning experience our older clients receive. As other Journal contributors have shared, there are multiple reasons to find a way to connect with younger clients, including: 1. To have a process in place. 2. To help grow the assets. 3. To help provide opportunities. 4. To help ease some of the financial education and advice. 5. To help young people move into their ideal career and ideal life.","Kirchenbauer, Lisa A K, CFP®, RLP®, CeFT®;Jones, Jared, CFP®", Cover Story,Oct,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Millennials , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Culture Vs. Shifting Economic Reality,"When it comes to who is expected to support whom and how, culture derives from the underlying country's personal financial reality, which in turn is based on the country's spending policies. Take the example that Statman describes of an American parent who agrees to pay for his daughter's education, but refuses to financially support her further, in contrast to the Israeli parents who expect to help their children buy a home and provide support well into their adult lives. In Israel, as in other countries with a strong Socialist tradition, higher education is heavily subsidized, and there is universal medical coverage demanding little financial outlay from individuals. Therefore, typical American upper-middle class parents, who usually don't get financial aid, are facing an education expense of $100,000 to $200,000 per child, while the Israeli parents' cost is nominal.","Goodman, Marina, CFP®, CFA", Commentary,Oct,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Culture , Parents & parenting , Children & youth , Higher education , Personal finance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Financial Planning: A Strong Link or Weak Link Profession?,"Financial planning is similar to a weak link sport, and we should consider O-ring theory. We can't afford to make a simple mistake in a part of the plan when other parts of the plan are dependent. Here is a similar comparison to soccer: all parts of the financial plan need to work together for our clients to achieve their goals. For example, we try to minimize taxes to save more money, then use that money to protect our clients with insurance and invest to get to retirement. Yet, it appears that some of us have been employing a strong link strategy. Another perspective is that while pursuing a superstar fund that could significantly outperform its benchmark adds value to the client, it doesn't add as much value as the decision to own the fund in a tax-efficient account. Last, consider weak link theory in the context of practice management.","Jakotowicz, Rich, CFP®, CFA", Journal Article,Oct,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Resource allocation , Professional ethics , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Steve Vernon on the Second Middle Age, Social Portfolio, and Retirement","In an interview, Steve Vernon, FSA, talked about second middle age, social portfolio, and retirement. According to Vernon, he has studied retirement all his professional life. At the beginning of his career, he was helping employers manage their retirement programs to comply with laws and regulations; he really didn't think of its effect on people's lives. But as he reached his 40s and 50s, he was more aware of the significance that retirement takes on for people and how it affects their lives, and he was getting older, so he started thinking about it personally. In my 40s and 50s and now 60s, he has been really interested in helping people with this transition out of the workforce and into retirement. He thinks the most challenging aspects of retirement are in decision-making -- how to help people make more effective decisions.

Planning for Conflict in Client Relationships,"Professionals use conflict resolution techniques in a variety of contexts to define the issues that underlie disagreements, generate alternative solutions to those issues, and reach resolutions. This paper demonstrates how conflict resolution techniques are applicable to financial planning practice and how these techniques can help clients set meaningful goals and increase the chance of successful plan implementation. All clients (single or coupled) operate in a complex social system where financial conflict has potential to arise with their spouse, parents, children, siblings, friends, and/or coworkers. Financial planners are not currently required to procure a conflict resolution skill set even though addressing and resolving financial conflict is a necessary part of financial planning practice. Essential communication skills for conflict resolution include developing empathy, reframing, reflective listening, and assertive messaging. These skills can help the financial planner navigate common client responses to financial conflict.","Asebedo, Sarah D, PhD, CFP®;Purdon, Emily, CFP®, EA", Journal Article,Oct,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Client relationships , Conflict resolution , Planning , Skills , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Advising Clients Under Stress: Tailor your communication skills to best serve clients in crisis,"Sooner or later during the client-planner relationship, some clients will need long-term services and support because of a cognitive or physical health condition. Such a period of care is often very stressful for clients and their families; that stress can impede planning and the ability to make good decisions.

Sabbatical Success: How to have a business to come back to after six weeks away,"Making the business case for a sabbatical isn't hard to do. Two 2017 articles, one in Forbes and the other in Harvard Business Review, make a convincing case for both the personal and organizational benefits of taking a sabbatical. Both articles report that the Society for Human Resource Management found that 17% of employers currently offer either a paid or unpaid sabbatical leave of anywhere from weeks to months. And sabbaticals aren't just for academics anymore. Intel and Motley Fool are just two companies providing their employees with this much-needed benefit. McDonald's began its sabbatical program in 1977. The Harvard Business Review article reported on research that found sabbaticals don't just benefit the employee, they allow the company to ""stress-test"" their capabilities and procedures.

Revisiting the 15-Year Mortgage as an Investment,"When purchasing a home, 88% of homebuyers in the US finance the purchase with a mortgage, according to the National Association of Realtors. The choice on which loan is best for each buyer may be determined by a variety of factors, such as affordability, expected length of time in the home, expectations about future interest rates, and risk preferences. Given the 33.1% of expenditures spent on housing among homeowners with mortgages, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, mortgage choice matters for the long-run wealth of homebuyers. Currently, the most common mortgage is the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Prior research found that the 30-year mortgage is often better given a 30-year investment horizon, however this analysis found the opposite was true. This paper deviated from the prior work on investment horizon and strategy. This paper revisited the comparison between those two options, but also considered that most homebuyers do not remain in their homes with the same mortgage for the full 30 years.","Farrell, James, PhD, CFA", Journal Article,Sep,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Home loans , Financial planners , Investments , Mortgages , Refinancing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Why Do We Care About Conflicts of Interest?,"Financial planners and other professionals hear a lot about conflicts of interest from professional publications, at professional meetings, and in their professional codes of ethics. As just one example, CFP Board's Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct, effective Oct 1, 2019, under Duties Owed to Clients, has Section 5 dedicated to disclosing and managing conflicts of interest. To gain an understanding of this, we should start with consideration of a common conflict, the kind we experience every day, and then consider how a conflict of interest is different. This will help us understand why conflicts of interest are important and should be avoided in professional practice if possible. A common conflict is a personal interest that periodically distracts us from our focus when exercising professional judgment on behalf of a client. The second type of risk relates directly to the financial planner, when he compromises his professional integrity in failing to exercise his best professional judgment.","Bearden, Frank, PhD", Journal Article,Sep,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Risk , Conflicts of interest , Professional ethics , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Your Clients Won't Run Out of Money. Now What?,"There are only two amounts of money: less-than-you-need and more-than-you-need. Over the years, I've often used this statement as an introductory framing for various client conversations. Our financial planning profession is increasingly good at putting people on a path to the latter, and that's all the more likely the better you've been at comprehensive and holistic financial planning. Research by the Center for Retirement Research and, more recently, David Blanchett validates what common sense has always told us: spending for even moderately affluent retirees declines in real terms over time. And this real decrease can approach 30 percent for retirees spending $100,000 or more annually from their mid-1960s to their mid-1980s. Furthermore, when retirees hold off withdrawing Roth IRA assets and gradually transition unneeded IRA required minimum distributions to post-tax brokerage accounts (with their eventual basis step-up), the tax impact can turbocharge this cross-generational transfer.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®", Journal Article,Sep,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Savings , Retirees , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Impact of Retirement Age Uncertainty on Retirement Outcomes,"A growing body of research notes that retirement age projections are inconsistent with actual retirement age decisions -- people tend to retire earlier than expected. Retiring early can have a significantly negative impact on a retiree's likelihood of meeting his or her retirement income goal by reducing the time for saving and investing, lowering the potential Social Security benefit, and potentially extending the retirement period (assuming the decision to retire early is independent from any kind of health shock). This paper explores the extent to which certain variables can help predict early (or late) retirement; it also explores the implications of early retirement on required savings levels. Few of the variables considered for the analysis have statistically significant coefficients, which suggests there is a significant amount of uncertainty (i.e., randomness) associated with the decision to retire early. One variable, though -- expected age of retirement -- drove the majority of the predictive effect of the model.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®", Journal Article,Sep,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Age , Financial planners , Early retirement , Uncertainty , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

6 Steps to Harnessing the Power of Empathy,"Empathy is being aware of and sharing another person's emotions and experiences. Listening with empathy means caring more about what someone is saying and feeling than what you want them to hear. It's a critical skill for financial planners. Empathetic planners feel their client's pain and respond accordingly. Without empathy, it's difficult to establish the emotional connection necessary to build trust in advisory relationships. Those who understand the feelings behind their client's story do more than provide financial solutions; they build confidence. Empathy isn't built without listening. You can harness its power in advisory relationships by listening well. Here are six ways to do it: 1. Give your undivided attention. 2. Learn non-verbal cues. 3. Ask the right questions. 4. Make a connection. 5. Don't be afraid of silence. 6.

Describing Life After Career: Demographic Differences in the Language and Imagery of Retirement,"This empirical study was conducted to understand people's perspectives toward retirement and to describe how views differ between people of various characteristics. Verbal and visual representations regarding life after completion of a career were collected online from 990 adults in the U.S. to uncover underlying ideas and map key concepts. A small number of words and features were reported in descriptions of retirement, indicating both an ambiguity and limitation in relating their current selves to possible future states. Perceptions of retirement were generally positive, and a sense of optimism was evident across different segments. Some demographic differences were found in thoughts on life after career. For example, people making less than $25,000 a year used fewer positive words and more negative words; younger adults' images were more likely to address financial well-being; and older adults and those with higher incomes provided more images related to travel.

A financial planner told me about a wealthy couple who wanted their investments to be true to their social responsibility values. That planner was attuned to his own culture, where investment returns and risks are all that matters, but deaf to the couple's culture.

Understanding the Tax Torpedo and Its Implications for Various Retirees,"According to the US Social Security Administration, 62% of aged beneficiaries received at least half of their income from Social Security in 2015. However, if a person's objective is to maximize their projected pretax lifetime benefits, it is difficult to determine when a single individual or each partner of a married couple should claim Social Security benefits. If their objective is to maximize projected after-tax lifetime benefits, it is even harder. This paper explains the ""tax torpedo,"" which refers to the sharp rise and then sharp fall in marginal tax rates caused by the taxation of Social Security benefits. For many middle-income households, this tax torpedo causes their marginal tax rate within a wide range of income to be 150% or 185% of their tax bracket.

Jack of All Trades or Master of One?,"Few people could match Jack's knowledge and experience as a financial planner. He believed that a good planner could help anyone at any time with any challenge, and he was energized by the variety of challenges he faced as a financial planner. Financial planners often ask if it would be better to position themselves as someone who does financial planning as a generalist or as someone who specializes in a specific area of financial planning. Many new planners begin their career as generalists, later developing areas of specialization based on the clients they tend to attract or their own background or area of interest. There are three key reasons for developing a niche market: 1. It provides you with a clear focus for your marketing efforts. 2. It gives you a sense of identity as a recognized expert in a specific area. 3. Perhaps most importantly, a well-established niche helps facilitate referrals.","Kornegay, Adam, RCC™;Kornegay, Susan, CFP®", Journal Article,Jul,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Medical referrals , Niche marketing , Referrals , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Financial Planning Lessons from a Tragic Event,"I'm going to tell a story about a tragic event. Although it was experienced by my family, it could have happened to you or your clients. I hope learning about my story will provide some lessons in coping with those situations when they arise in your personal or professional life. My son died.

It has three ordinary words in a simple sentence construction, yet the underlying concept is too complex for human understanding. Here are some financial planning lessons from a tragic event: 1.

Promoting Improvement: A Key to Teamwork Excellence,"Providing great service to clients is critical for CFP practitioner firms to succeed. Perhaps it goes without saying that having team members get better at what they do leads to excellence, but there is much more to ""improvement"" than job excellence. A leader who pays attention to the needs for improvement within their organization should also pay attention to the desires of the team members for self-improvement. Organizational development researchers call this ""improvement behavior,"" which strengthens the trust relationship between the leader and the team member. This relationship quality is called the ""leader-member exchange,"" or LMX, in academic literature. LMX is a crucial concept in understanding how leaders get things done through their team members. LMX develops one team member at a time with the leader. If a leader has five team members, the leader has five LMX relationships to consider.","Smith, David F, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,Jul,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Teamwork , Financial planners , Success factors , Leadership , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Sharing the Wealth: Considerations in NexGen Ownership,"We've all seen the figures; advisers are aging. There is an abundance of opportunity for young professionals entering the financial planning profession. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem as though this opportunity necessarily translates to a meaningful transfer of ownership. Founders are struggling to develop and implement sound succession plans. Perhaps they cannot seem to find capable hands or are reluctant to part with a portion of the lucrative earnings generated by their established firm. Whatever the reason, I believe that the firms that can transition ownership to the next generation will thrive, empowering and engaging the future of our profession. At the time I joined RTD Financial, we had six owners, which in and of itself, signified opportunity. Our founder, Roy Diliberto, had thoughtfully engaged the next generation of owners to implement and execute his own succession plan.

Understand the Rules on HSAs to Reduce the Cost of Medical Care,"When advising your clients on ways to save money tax-free for future medical expenses, one thing to consider is a health savings account (HSA). To reduce the cost of medical care using HSAs, it's imperative to understand the rules around them. HSAs are similar to individual retirement accounts for medical expenses. Both individuals and employers can contribute to HSAs for eligible individuals. HSAs are funded with pre-tax dollars, and distributions are tax-exempt if used for qualifying medical expenses. Like an IRA, HSA funds do not have to be spent in a calendar year and can be carried over in the plan balance indefinitely. If a person is eligible, he or she can make deductible contributions to an HSA that is administered by a financial institution or insurance company. To be eligible for an HSA, a person must meet several conditions. First, he or she must be covered under a high-deductible health insurance plan.","Welch, Julie A, CPA, CFP®, PFP;Smith, Cara L, CPA, CFP®", Journal Article,Jul,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Health care expenditures , Eligibility , Financial planners , Health savings accounts , Cost control , Cost reduction , Medical savings accounts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Great Suppression: Actions and Implications for Gold Investors,"This research explored the traditional role of gold as an inflation hedge under the economic backdrop of low interest rates and low inflation, specifically during the era of 2008 to 2017, referred to here as the ""Great Suppression."" During the period studies, gold provided a favorable risk-adjusted return profile to portfolios made up mostly of stocks during a period of low inflation and low interest rates, but offered no yield or guarantee of growth going forward. Gold did not offer a favorable risk-adjusted return profile to portfolios made up of mostly bonds, nor to yield-reliant investors.

The Value of Financial Designations: A Consumer Perspective,"A financial adviser is responsible for using the information received from a consumer to make informed recommendations regarding optimal choices for the consumer's financial plan. The consumer relies on the expertise and professional judgment of a financial adviser when delegating these research activities. However, consumers may not be aware of the level of competence of their financial advisers. To make more informed decisions about the advisers they want to hire, consumers rely on signals that advisers provide, such as their financial designations. The question remains: do consumers value financial services received from credentialed advisers more than the services received from non-credentialed advisers? In this paper, the theoretical models of agency theory and signal theory were used to answer this question. Agency theory was used to test if consumers were willing to incur higher bonding costs in order to lower monitoring costs. Signal theory was tested to determine if there was weight to the signal (professional designation), and if consumers were willing to pay more for a credentialed adviser.","Raskie, Sterling, PhD, CFP®, EA;Martin, Jason, PhD;Lemoine, Craig, PhD, CFP®;Cummings, Benjamin F, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,Jun,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Certification , Trust , Agency theory , Consumers , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"THE WILD, WILD WEST","Though cryptocurrency has been around since 2008, launching with the white paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, interest in them peaked at the end of 2017 when the value of Bitcoin exploded and subsequently crashed early this year.

Many of the provisions remain unchanged, but several of the changes can be extremely helpful in reducing a family unit's taxes. Dependent children with earned income are generally better off under the new law. The Act's repeal of the exemption deduction does not affect these children because their parents claimed the exemption deduction under pre-Act law. Children with income under $1,050 do not even have to file a tax return, unless he or she has net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more.

To Rent or Buy? A 30-Year Perspective,"Past studies have suggested that home ownership is superior to renting, and a number of rent-versus-buy calculators exist; many of which support this finding. These calculators, however, often do not incorporate all the expenses involved with either home ownership or renting, and many assume a short time horizon despite the fact that many families maintain households for decades. This paper presents long-term, historical scenarios for six metropolitan areas that compare accumulated ending wealth for the rent-versus-buy decision. The scenarios incorporate the major costs of home ownership and renting over a 30-year time horizon. These historical scenarios, which reflect year-to-year changes in such factors as mortgage rates and investment returns, show that home ownership has not always been the best financial decision for a family.","Cox, Arthur, PhD;Foltowill, Richard, PhD", Journal Article,May,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Home ownership , Rents , Buy or make decisions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Clients' Perceptions of Their Financial Futures Predict Choices,"This study examined the relationship between perceptions of financial future and intertemporal choice by using a new psychological framework -- the future self-continuity framework -- to investigate intertemporal choices. Intertemporal choice is largely based on the concept of temporal discounting. Some individuals can delay immediate gratification with their money for a better financial future. Others prefer immediate gratification, which comes at a cost to their future financial well-being. Regression results suggest that perceptions about financial future predict ability to delay gratification. In particular, perceptions about similarity to a person's financial future and positivity about the performance of the economy may dictate whether clients are willing to delay gratification and save for their future. Results also provide evidence that the ability to visualize their financial future and the details of financial goals influence individuals' willingness to delay gratification. Financial planners can use the results of this study to help clients feel connected with their financial future.","Zepp, Phillip P;Heckman, Stuart J, CFP® PhD", Journal Article,May,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Studies , Perceptions , Regression analysis , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

With this objective in mind, the first part of this article will introduce planners to the RUFADAA and some of the key provisions that provide a framework for advising clients with regard to digital assets. The second part of this article will focus on the some of the strategies that planners may wish to utilize as part of a client's estate plan. A couple of words of caution, before we begin our journey. First, this article will not discuss the impact of any federal law or state criminal or privacy law as it applies to digital assets.

Don't Forget Digital Assets in Estate Planning,"As a planner, you can ensure that your clients' digital property is appropriately managed and dispersed upon incapacity or death. Digital assets are the online accounts in your clients' name that may include files such as photos, images, and videos; email accounts; and social media and networking accounts including Facebook, Linkedln, and YouTube. Fortunately, you can help your clients and their family members avoid obstacles by addressing digital property and information in their estate plans. You can arrange for full access to their digital property, minimize administration costs, and ensure that no valuable or significant digital property is overlooked. Many states, including Florida, New York, California, and Illinois, have recently adopted versions of the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act. Talk to your clients about how they want their online life handled after their death.

The Financial Implications of Cohabitation Among Young Adults,"Cohabitation is a common path to marriage for many millennials, with two-thirds of couples living with a significant other at least once before marriage. By delaying or opting out of marriage in early years, couples may be less financially prepared for retirement in later years. Previous research has found that men and women who have consumer debt are more likely to begin cohabitating with their significant other, yet combining consumer debt is associated with a higher risk of relationship dissolution. In contrast, buying a home with one's partner was associated in this study with a higher likelihood of transitioning to marriage, likely because of the higher entry and exit costs of the purchase. This study's findings indicate that cohabiters have lower net worth and financial asset accumulation than married respondents, but repeat cohabiters and married respondents with previous cohabiting unions have no less non-financial assets than married respondents who have never cohabited. Younger clients who have cohabited many times may be less interested in long-term planning and more interested in current consumption in the form of non-financial assets; whereas clients who are not cohabiting or cohabiting for the first time with a long-term partner might be more future-oriented with their financial planning.","Britt-Lutter, Sonya, PhD, CFP®;Dorius, Cassandra, PhD;Lawson, Derek, CFP®", Journal Article,Apr,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Young adults , Millennials , Consumer credit , Long term planning , Marriage , Personal relationships",ProQuest One Academic
Business Entity Selection: A Human Capital Approach,"Entrepreneurship remains prevalent in the United States despite the associated high rates of failure, undiversified business holdings, and lower growth in personal earnings. Prior research has shown positive outcomes for incorporated business owners. Using human capital theory as a guide and data from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, this study examined the factors that distinguish business owners from non-owners and incorporated owners from their non-incorporated counterparts. Net worth, income, education, years of work experience, and the use of professional advisers were positively associated with business ownership. And among business owners, net worth and a financial sophistication factor were positively associated with incorporation. The results suggest there are opportunities for financial planners to improve networking with other professional service providers, such as accountants or lawyers, in order to more actively engage future business owners, especially following recent changes to tax law.","Potter, Derek;Heckman, Stuart J, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,Apr,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Human capital , Tax legislation , Entrepreneurship , Business ownership",ProQuest One Academic
Don't Let Them Quit!,"Leadership studies find that each employed person has a degree of what is called voluntary termination intention (VTI), and financial planning firms are not immune to this employee characteristic. VTI came up during a recent FPA chapter meeting: ""Millennials just up and leave"" complained a baby boomer planning firm partner. Losing valuable personnel is costly to a firm; planning skills, operational expertise, and marketing talent are hard to develop and replace. Losing an employee is an obvious cost of the high end of the VTI spectrum, but other organizational costs also exist. What this means for a financial planning practice is summed up well with that statement made at the FPA chapter meeting about millennial leaving after being hired, trained, and shown a career path. The statement illustrates three challenges: 1. understanding the psychology of employees, 2. Knowing which rewards each employee values. 3.

2018 Is an Important Planning Year in Divorce Situations,"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) repeals the above-the-line deduction for alimony and separate maintenance payments and makes such payments nontaxable to recipients. The change applies to divorce or separation instruments executed after Dec 31, 2018. The revisions also apply to instruments executed before the effective date, if they are modified after Dec 31, 2018 and expressly provide that new law will apply to the modification. The Act revisions impacting divorce aiming go beyond the alimony changes. As a result of these changes, 2018 is an important planning year for clients in the midst of a divorce, contemplating a divorce, or needing to modify documents from a prior divorce.

Ignoring Business Development: The Greatest Planning Disaster of the Next Generation,"We are all in sales. In 2014, I tore my ACL and meniscus in an adult, co-ed soccer game. Embarrassing, I know. The knee reconstruction was a big investment, not only financially, but also physically, to get back to where I started. I define ""selling"" as the exchange of time, energy, or financial resources for a product, service, or better outcome. I spend a lot of time networking with financial professionals both inside and outside our profession. The annual Rydcx|SGI Advisor-Benchmarking survey has confirmed that is not the case, by stating that the most common source of referrals is passive. Passive referrals are generated by the fact that at least one client likes your services enough to send their friends or family your way, without you having to ask.

In the beginning it was survival. Now it's succession. Our profession is coming of age. We are seeing a shift in how financial planning practices are organized.

I Don't Need Life Insurance,"Rules of thumb in financial planning aren't always reliable, either. For example, one rule of thumb is that the amount of life insurance needed is seven to 10 times annual income. Sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes it doesn't. Even when it works, it's a pretty lame way to approach an issue worthy of serious analysis. The point of having life insurance on an income-generating individual in a family situation is to replace the income. Many financial planners use Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the probability that a retirement fund balance will last for a specified period. Monte Carlo analysis provides a backdoor way to consider the relative need for life insurance. When you identify the fund amount that generates a 95% probability of success, simply subtract $1 million from that amount and the difference is the life insurance need.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU", Commentary,Mar,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Monte Carlo simulation , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Has Your Advice Evolved with Technology?,"Just a couple of years ago, the word ""digital"" was largely used to refer to the new entrant in the financial services industry -- the robo-adviser. Financial planners' long-standing, often paper-based processes were quickly becoming archaic and cumbersome, and the robo-adviser was viewed as the competitor, but now technology is increasingly viewed as a planner's team member. As the fast-paced digital world continues to take shape, financial institutions and planners need to engage with technology through various levels. Planners can incorporate technology into their practices in different ways. Many use a single provider that addresses multiple technology needs, from onboarding to trading and reporting, in one consolidated platform.

"Use These Behavioral Tips to ""Science"" Your Clients on Saving","According to a 2017 study from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, only 61% of responding American workers reported having saved money for retirement, with 56% of respondents reporting they are currently saving (at the time of the survey) for their golden years.

As a financial planner, this isn't news to you, though it may be more disappointing for you than most given your line of work. Presented here are a few tools to help your clients get past some of the standard pitfalls around saving, using the very science that generates the issues as your weapon: 1.

Using a Behavioral Approach to Mitigate Panic and Improve Investor Outcomes,"In standard practice for financial planning, at least two competing demands are placed on the asset allocation process: taking on risk to help clients reach their financial goals, and decreasing risk to keep clients from panicking and abandoning the plan. To manage these competing demands, financial planners can apply two approaches: a risk capacity approach that focuses on goals and generating the required returns; and/or a risk preference approach that seeks to avoid panic. In isolation or in combination, these two approaches may fail to help clients reach their goals and forestall panic. This paper presents a third approach to helping clients. This behavioral approach brings behavioral interventions into the investment process and can potentially relieve the burden of these competing demands on asset allocation. To understand the benefits and limitations of each approach, this paper presents results from a novel simulation model of investor behavior. The model demonstrated how investor panic resulted in a loss of between 8 percent and 15 percent of assets over a 10-year period, under standard risk capacity-based asset allocations and risk preference-adjusted glide paths. The results were robust to a range of model specifications and assumptions. In moving from a standard approach of risk preference, adjusting glide paths to the proposed behavioral approach, investors may receive a net increase of 17% to 23% in assets over 10 years.","Wendel, Stephen, PhD", Journal Article,Feb,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Simulation , Investors , Asset allocation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Traditionally, when financial planning started, we thought that to be professionals, we just needed to deliver these money skills, this money knowledge, and the tricks of the trade so to speak. Life planning is much more about listening than it is about having a series of questions that work, because finding your way to be in an authentic relationship with a client is deeper than where a series of questions can take you.

Managing Student Loans in a Changing Landscape,"Student loan debt is the second largest type of consumer debt (after mortgages), totaling $1.3 trillion.

One of the most important things a planner can do at the beginning of an advice session with a client is figure out what type of student loans that borrower has, because it's the type of loan that's going to inform their rights and their options for dealing with that loan. Federal loans are issued directly by the federal government through the US Department of Education's Direct loan program, or through a now defunct program that issued many older loans called the Family Federal Education Loan program, also known as the guaranteed loan program, where a private lender fronted the money but it was backed by the federal government.","Minsky, Adam S, JD", Cover Story,Feb,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Student loans , Financial planners , Guaranteed loans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Rebalancing According to Behavioral Portfolio Theory,"The stock market has climbed so very high. Mean-variance portfolio theory says you should rebalance, selling stocks and buying bonds. Behavioral portfolio theory says you may not need to rebalance, but if you do, behavioral rebalancing is different from mean-variance rebalancing. Central features in behavioral portfolio theory rest on the observation that aspirations drive risk attitudes. We invest for a chance to reach our aspirations, and risk is payment for a chance to avoid falling short of our aspirations. Shortfall aversion takes the role of risk aversion in behavioral portfolio theory, whereas variance aversion and loss aversion take that role in mean-variance portfolio theory. Shortfall aversion interacts with loss aversion, illustrated by the choice to buy a lottery ticket. The choice to buy a $1 lottery ticket is inconsistent with loss aversion.","Statman, Meir, PhD", Commentary,Feb,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Theory , Risk aversion , Bank portfolios , Securities markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Effects of Social Security Benefits and RMDs on Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Strategies,"Financial planners often determine and recommend tax-efficient withdrawal strategies for their clients. This paper highlights how a portfolio's life can be extended by managing withdrawals from taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt accounts for a wide variety of clients, with graphs that help planners visualize the effects throughout the portfolio's life. Cook, Meyer, and Reichenstein (2015) showed that decumulating taxable investments coupled with converting to Roth IRAs in the early years of retirement to fully use the 15 percent tax rate bracket, followed by decumulating tax-deferred accounts in the later years of retirement to fully use the 15 percent tax rate bracket coupled with withdrawals from Roth retirement accounts can improve tax efficiency. Their analysis was extended here to consider Social Security benefits and required minimum distributions. It compared their recommended strategy to both a strategy that equates taxable income every year and a strategy some call the conventional wisdom. This comparison was made for a variety of circumstances. Results indicate that two strategies (one that fully uses the 15 percent tax rate bracket, and one that equalizes tax brackets across years by equalizing taxable incomes across years) outperformed the conventional wisdom for the variety of circumstances.","Geisler, Greg, PhD;Hulse, David S, PhD", Journal Article,Feb,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Effects , Roth IRAs , Tax rates , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Tax planning , Social security , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Think ""Inclusion"" to Build Teamwork","Getting the rights to work done the right way is crucial to every financial planning practice -- and it requires teamwork. A practice leader, office manager, or lead planner who builds a high-quality social exchange relationship with each team member individually will benefit from having high-performing individuals and a high-performing team. Leadership studies show that teamwork relies on the one-on-one relationship between the team leader and each team member individually. This article focuses on inclusion, a specific leader behavior that Five Star Leadership finds positively associated with high-quality social exchange relationships with individual team members. A leader has a choice on how they work with team members. When a leader needs a complex task completed, he or she could tell a team member what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and how high to jump. Inclusion, Practice leaders, office managers, and other team leaders have work that they need to get done; they rely on others to help accomplish those tasks to meet goals.","Smith, David F, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,Feb,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Teamwork , Financial planners , Behavior , Leadership , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Appropriate Investment Strategies During a Period of Care,"It is estimated that the majority of 65-year-olds will need long-term assistance at some point. While most financial planners know that most families will need help, many do not explore long-term services and supports (LTSS) planning beyond an analysis of long-term care (LTC) insurance needs. Planners can guide clients requiring LTSS to make better financial decisions with a fiduciary process that includes appropriate communication, relationship management, and technical skills. The focus here is not LTC insurance or planning for the possibility of care in the future, but rather how financial planners can optimize income, investment, and tax planning during a period of care. When modeling LTSS scenarios with planning software, the planner may overlook significant value. The traditional liquidation sequence may lead to higher risk and taxes and less money for care. Once the planner, with input from a care professional, has determined a client's new financial circumstances including projected costs for care, several areas will require attention.","West, Thomas C, CLU, ChFC, AIF;Starnes, Steven A, CFP", Journal Article,Jan,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Long term care insurance , Tax planning , Investment policy , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Someone to Watch over Me,"As the classic sing, ""Someone to Watch over Me,"" introduced by George and Ira Gershwin in 1926 attests, we all seek comfort in the care and protection of others. As financial planners, we are also increasingly required to watch over our vulnerable clients to provide protection against suspected financial exploitation. New regulations addressing elder abuse, effective in February 2018, will impact planners and their clients. The problem of elder abuse (including financial exploitation) is real and well-documented. It can take many forms, including physical and emotional abuse. Financial exploitation, however, is estimated as the third most common form of elder abuse, after self-neglect and caregiver neglect, according to the National Center on Elder Abuse. President Obama summarized the problem in a presidential proclamation as part of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, on Jun 15, 2015. This article offers information on recent federal- and state-level regulatory responses to the financial exploitation of the elderly (as a form of elder abuse) and explores the importance of incompetency planning.","Renner, John F, LLM, JD, CFP, ChFC", Journal Article,Jan,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Adult abuse & neglect , Federal regulation , Exploitation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How Nobel Laureate Richard Thaler's Work Impacts Financial Planning,"Richard Thaler, who is arguably the father of behavioral economics, recently won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Prior to the 1980s, almost all economists assumed that people were rational actors. The significance of Thaler's work stems from the idea that people are less rational than assumed, and that psychology may influence human behavior in predictable ways. What follows is an overview of some of Thaler's research findings and applications to the field of financial planning. One of the financial planning implications from this paper is that investors should evaluate their portfolios annually in order to maximize happiness. Myopic behavior has been shown to influence the allocation decisions of individuals. Research co-authored by Thaler found that students who were shown monthly returns allocated 59% of their hypothetical allocation to a bond fund and the remainder to a stock fund. Some academic research includes economic assumptions that are unrealistic and thus the findings may not be directly relatable to financial planning practitioners.","Evensky, Harold, CFP, AIF;Guillemette, Michael A, PhD, CFP", Journal Article,Jan,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Behavior , Financial planning , Investors , Effects , Economists , United States--US , Thaler, Richard H",ProQuest One Academic
4 Listening Skills that Will Boost Your Bottom Line,"Becoming a better listener is one of the most important -- and lucrative -- skills you can develop as a financial planner.

Hybrid Advice: Blurring the Roles of Client and Adviser,"I would like to preface this column by pointing out one thing: it is difficult to elucidate a specific incident that will happen in 2018. Rather, my ""prediction"" will highlight the evolution that is already occurring: the role of the adviser and client will continue to blur, moving us further toward the world of ""hybrid advice."" Hybrid advice is relatively new terminology that has begun to permeate the market. It is an interesting area of advice, sandwiched between our two current advice delivery models. The first advice model is not a recent trend, but rather, the way things were: traditional advice delivery, typically to baby boomers. Traditional advice delivery is what we all know -- advisers or other financial professionals visiting with their clients episodically throughout the year, delivering hard copy financial plans. The other advice model -- what we are witnessing today -- is consumers who want very little interaction with advisers, either because they merely do not wish to engage or they do not have enough investable assets.","Stich, Anthony", Journal Article,Jan,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Clients , Business models , Baby boomers , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Fruitful 50s: 7 Planning Opportunities for the Decade Before Retirement,"Most retirement planning topics focus on decisions and issues important just before, right as, or shortly after an individual or couple retires. This seems true in both professional journals and financial services trade publications, as well as in the consumer press. But a number of planning steps and strategies arise in the decade or so before retirement -- that is, in one's 50s usually -- that can have a big impact before the start of a retirement transition. In this column, however, I want to explore seven planning opportunities that are potentially available in the years before these cash flow transitions begin. These are: 1. building the nest egg, 2. income, 3. housing expenses, 4. what's no longer needed, 5. what may be need now, 6. portfolio allocation and 7. it may not be so complicated anymore.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP", Journal Article,Jan,2018,Journal of Financial Planning," Transitions , Guidelines , Financial services , Retirement planning , Cash flow , Moving & housing expenses , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

That same New York Times article reported that family caregivers lose more than $300,000 in wages and benefits over their lifetime because of the interruption in employment they experience providing care. In addition, family caregivers are often unhealthier and experience more emotional stress than their noncaregiving counterparts.

Every financial planning practice can benefit from learning about these behaviors. Leaders motivate others to do what needs to be done. Implicit in this discussion is that the leader knows what needs getting done: increase revenue, attain more clients, ensure a smooth-running staff, or any other goal.

Enhancing Financial Confidence Among Widows: The Role of Financial Professionals,"A renewed effort among researchers over the past decade has focused on better understanding the value financial planners add to their clients' well-being. Rather than focus on the benefits of financial planning strictly from an alpha viewpoint, several studies have examined other elements of a client's situation that improve when working with a financial planner. The present study was undertaken to further this line of inquiry by testing whether the interpersonal skill of a financial planner (i.e., a qualitative factor) is associated with a client's engagement in improved financial planning behavior, as well as increased financial confidence. The sample used for this study included widowed women who had remarried or entered into a long-term committed partnership. A primary contribution of this study is to help the financial planning community document another value of financial planning: building financial confidence among vulnerable populations.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP®;West, Carrie L, PhD;Leitz, Linda Y, PhD, CFP®;Rehl, Kathleen M, PhD, CFP®;Moor, Carolyn C;Hernandez, Michele N;Bradley, Susan, CFP®", Journal Article,Dec,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Widows & widowers , Client relationships , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Stop Questioning Your Profession's Status,"The financial planning profession seems to suffer from an identity crisis, more so in my opinion from those who have been at it for a longer time. It seems to me that younger planners embrace the profession without the impediments of philosophizing on what the profession should be. Financial planning is complex and multifaceted in its functions and roles. Collectively, we serve multiple generations, different classes of people, all with different goals. If you toss in words like fiduciary, broker-dealer, registered investment adviser, compensation neutrality, fee-only, and many others, framing the profession into a neat, definitive standard becomes challenging.

"Crafting Retirement Income That Is Stable, Secure, and Sustainable","Financial planners are driven by the passionate desire to serve clients with evidence-based convictions. Yet, planners often seem locked in a battle with each other over the superior method to deliver retirement income to clients. Often, this leads to staking out a position that one method is universally superior to others. In retirement planning, planners should consider a logical, definitional-based framework as convictional where empirical, evidence-based information is not available or is unclear. Our view is that the only clear answer to this deeper question for retirement income is found in what we call the 3-S model framework: it must be simultaneously stable, secure, and sustainable. Any 3-S approach (agreement-based, mortality-based, or historically based) can be reasonable and prudent to cover base expenses with a minimum coverage ratio of 1:1. Planners should use their knowledge, judgement, and discretion about their client to offer solutions or the best combination of solutions to craft retirement income in an unknowable context.","Branning, Jason K, CFP®;Grubbs, M Ray, PhD", Journal Article,Dec,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Models , Financial planners , Income , Retirement planning , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Examining Total Portfolio Performance: U.S. Government Vs. Corporate Bonds,"Stocks, compared to bonds, have historically contributed more volatility and return to portfolios. Adding bonds to a portfolio has been shown to decrease portfolio volatility. The bond asset class can be broken down into a variety of sub-asset classes, including: 1. US government, 2. corporate, and 3. international debt, among others. Each bond asset class has its own unique risk and return characteristics. Although there are many bond asset classes, the focus of this study was on the two oldest bond asset classes: US government bonds and domestic corporate bonds. This choice was guided by the availability of robust index data since 1926. US government-backed debt has been noted as the superior portfolio diversifier. Thus, this study sought to test and quantify the value of US government debt relative to UScorporate debt in a portfolio alongside stocks with the goal to better enable financial planners to produce the optimum portfolio allocation for their clients.","Luskin, Jon, CFP®", Journal Article,Dec,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Government bonds , Corporate bonds , Portfolio performance , Corporate debt , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Claiming a Casualty Loss After a Disaster,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria devastated much of Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast, Florida, and Puerto Rico during August and September. Some federal tax provisions can be used to help those affected recoup some of their losses, namely casualty loss deductions, and for those in federally declared disaster areas (qualified disaster areas), special extensions of time to comply with certain tax responsibilities. For individuals to claim a casualty loss on their federal income tax return, they must itemize deductions on Schedule A, Itemized Deductions. To determine the amount of the casualty loss, subtract any insurance money received (or the amount expected to be received from the insurance company) from the basis in the property. If one receives more insurance proceeds than the basis in their property, there will be a casualty gain.

What Is My Practice Worth?: What you need to know about value and valuation,"What is my practice worth is a question that every independent financial adviser should ask, or has asked, at one time or another. Given that the value of a fee-based advisory practice is often the largest asset that most advisers own, it is a good question in need of good answers. The starting place for most advisers who need a formal valuation is this simple mantra: purpose, standard, approach, and method. These are the key starting points in every valuation engagement. Any time a business appraisal is needed, the standard of value, approach, and method(s) used for estimating value should be tied directly to the purpose or reason that the valuation is being conducted. Value is a function of purpose, and the answer is not universally applicable to every situation. The most common reasons why your practice valued include non-tax valuation and tax valuation. No single valuation approach and method works every time in every situation.","Grau, Ryan, CVA, CBA", Cover Story,Nov,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Professional practice , Business valuation , Valuation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Valuing Roth Conversion and Recharacterization Options,"This paper explains the options provided by the tax code for Roth conversions and recharacterizations. Models are presented of the after-tax value of Roth conversion strategies to the strategy of retaining funds in a TDA and withdrawing these funds in a later year. Four reasonable cases illustrate how the Roth conversion and recharacterization options in the tax code could allow a taxpayer to increase the after-tax value of the funds converted to a Roth account by 5.56 percent, compared to the strategy of retaining these same funds in a tax-deferred account until later in retirement. One particular case, in which the Roth conversion increased the after-tax value by 62.79 percent, reflects the situation many taxpayers face. An example explains what a financial adviser should do to take advantage of the Roth conversion/ recharacterization options available in the tax code.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA;Meyer, William", Journal Article,Nov,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Conversion , Roth IRAs , Tax planning , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Reviewing Asset Allocation in the Context of the Retirement Plan,"Advisers should consider these factors, as follows, when deciding on the aggressiveness of both spending and asset allocation within a retirement income plan: 1. capacities (resiliencies), 2. aspirations (goals), 3. returns (assumptions), 4. emotional comfort (constraints). Meanwhile, a more aggressive retiree will tend to fall in the opposite direction on these matters, highlighting the highly personal and complex nature of these decisions. It is only after thinking about these different types of questions and assessing assets and liabilities on the retirement balance sheet that clients are able to fully determine their appropriate asset allocation and withdrawal rate decisions.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Journal Article,Nov,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Asset allocation , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
A Fiduciary Approach for Clients Who Need Long-Term Services and Supports,"The rising financial cost of long-term care in the US widely understood. The enormous personal challenge for family caregivers is also well documented. More than two-thirds of 65-year-olds will need assistance planning for a possible period of care at some point, according to a 2013 Congressional Budget Office report. Although most financial planners know that families will need help, many do not explore long-term services and supports (LTSS) planning beyond an analysis of long-term care insurance needs. Furthermore, many planners have little or no training in advising families through a current period of care. This article builds on research and knowledge from the medical, caregiving, and financial professions to provide guidance on working with clients navigating periods of care. Further research on clients' LTSS experiences should produce findings that will enable planners to make more accurate financial planning assumptions for their clients during a period of LTSS.","West, Thomas C, CLU®, ChFC®, AIF®;Starnes, Steven A, CFP®", Journal Article,Nov,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Long term care insurance , Clients , Long term health care , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Are Your Clients Not Spending Enough in Retirement?,"A few months ago i was speaking at a conference about the mental obstacles underlying the ""consumption gap"" and how financial advisers can help clients overcome them. The consumption gap is between people's actual consumption and potential consumption made possible by their wealth. In the February 2016 Journal paper, ""Spending in Retirement: Determining the Consumption Gap,"" Chris Browning and his co-authors found consumption gaps among people with median financial assets, not only among the wealthy. Adviser questions following my presentation were not about how to help clients find joy in spending their ample assets on themselves, their families, and the needy. Instead, they were about the ""retirement crisis"" and the need to encourage people to save more and spend less. We tackle the saving and spending task with the mental tools of framing, mental accounting, and self-control. Self-control can be excessive. Indeed, excessive self-control is as prevalent as insufficient self-control.","Statman, Meir, PhD", Journal Article,Nov,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Self control , Expenditures , Clients , Retirement planning , Consumption , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Identifying Variation in Client Characteristics between Financial Planning Compensation Models,"This study examines how client characteristics differ between individuals who use commission-only, fee-only, and commission-and- fee financial planners. Data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) Investor Survey were used to explore client profiles, portfolio characteristics, adviser-use characteristics, and client perceptions. Some client characteristics were related to the type of services provided by each compensation model. By understanding these profiles, financial planners can help focus their marketing material and skills toward the types of clients who are most likely to use their services. The variation in client profiles is important to consider within the context of pending Department of Labor fiduciary requirements. Given identical standards of care, these profiles provide evidence that there are significant market demands for services of all compensation models.","Seay, Martin C, PhD, CFP®;Anderson, Somer G, CPA;Lawson, Derek R, CFP®;Kim, Kyoung Tae, PhD", Journal Article,Oct,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Models , Financial planning , Compensation , Marketing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Integrating Home Equity and Retirement Savings through the ""Rule of 30""","This paper examines the effect of using reverse mortgage credit lines to supplement retirement income by two types of retirees that have not been addressed in the previous literature: (1) those whose retirement savings are significantly below those of the mass affluent; and (2) those who are ""house rich/cash poor."" Results of this analysis demonstrate an important contrast with the results of the earlier literature; specifically, the greater percentages of home value, when coordinated with the retirement savings portfolio, resulted in substantially greater percentages of the portfolio that can be drawn. This paper suggests a new alternative to the 4 percent rule that can guide planners and retirees toward an optimal cash withdrawal strategy. This new rule takes into account the total of the retiree's retirement savings plus his or her home value. The quantitative analysis in this paper uses the same spreadsheet models and strategies first presented in the Journal by Sacks and Sacks (2012).

Choosing a Continuing Care Facility,"A growing number of seniors and their caregivers select a life care facility based on the elder person's immediate care needs without a thought for the future. You begin in advising your clients if they are talking about any kind of supportive housing arrangements, such as an assisted living facility or continuing care retirement community (CCRC), for themselves or for their parents. CCRCs are not independent living communities, assisted living facilities, or nursing homes. They are combinations of all of these residential and care options, which are staffed to provide a ""continuum of care'"" for residents. The assisted living and nursing home components of CCRCs are usually intended for use only by residents from the independent living units that are part of the CCRC and not by seniors from outside of the facility.

Build Your Brand to Build Client Trust,"Your brand is not your tagline, elevator speech, logo, or even all your marketing combined. Your brand is your total firm identity. It identifies what you do, what clients experience, and how you are different from competitors. Gathering feedback from clients on what they value most about your service offerings is a critical step to developing your brand. Later in this article, I'll discuss three techniques you can employ today to build a more focused brand using that client feedback. Those three techniques are: 1. Clarify who you are. 1. Clear the clutter. 3. Communicate in a compelling way. Apple, the world's top brand, is a good example of the financial value of earned trust. The value of Apple's brand increases its market value by 21%, according to Forbes' list of top brands for 2017.

Focusing on Life Transitions Is Good for Clients and Planners,"This article is the third in a series of three articles exploring a more meaningful and more permanent value proposition that today's planners can offer their clients. If you're not in tune with the life transitions your clients are going through -- or will soon go through -- it could mean clients will leave your practice. In this article, we'll show you that there is a need for fundamentally focusing on life transitions to positively impact the well-being of both your client and your practice. There are three things to consider when providing clients a life-centered plan: 1. It must address the transitions unique to each client. 2. It is better to prepare than to repair. Much self-sabotaging financial behavior could be avoided by proactively addressing life transitions. 3. There is an umbilical relationship between life being in transition and money being in motion. Consequently, the common transitions most financial advisers address are children going to college, retirement, purchasing a home, and death.","Anthony, Mitch;Sanduski, Steve, CFP®", Journal Article,Oct,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Transitions , Client relationships , Life transitions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Grow Your Practice by Serving the Spanish-Speaking Market,"According to the US Census Bureau, Spanish has been the second-most commonly spoken language in the US since the 1980s. The Spanish-speaking population has been growing steadily and is expected to continue doing so. This consistently growing market represents opportunities across various industries. Although some industries have experienced revenue growth by catering to Spanish-speaking consumers, the financial planning and advising sectors have been significantly behind. An online search of Certified Financial Planner and other financial advisers who identify themselves as fiduciaries (including non-Latino planners) produces few results of those who explicitly also offer their services in Spanish. The 2016 annual report published by the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce found that the Hispanic share of all new entrepreneurs was 20.8%, versus 10% a decade ago. One reason more planners do not appear to be catering to Spanish-speaking clients could be due to a common misconception about this market segment.","Gonzalez, Claudia", Journal Article,Oct,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Spanish language , Financial planning , Financial planners , Entrepreneurs , Revenue , Target markets , Hispanic Americans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Don't Let the Tax Reform Tail Wag the Dog,"There has been much talk about tax reform recently, but little action. The partisan divide that has characterized Washington over the past several years has prevented any meaningful attempts to make substantive changes to the tax code. Since the 2016 election, the new administration and Congressional leaders have indicated that tax reform will be a top priority. The president and several prominent members of Congress have proposed a complete repeal of the estate tax that would be partially offset by limiting the step-to basis provision of Section 1014. Should this proposal be adopted, this would be a real win for affluent taxpayers.

To be honest, the client-facing portion of the internship was my least favorite. Centering his schedule around client meetings proved to be difficult, the meeting preparation process was arduous, and the almost daily face-to-face interactions through long meetings with clients became draining.

Does the Benefit of Deferring Social Security Offset the Opportunity Cost to Do So?,"This study examined the extent to which deferring the claiming date for Social Security benefits preserved an individual's tax-deferred retirement assets, thus enhancing the ability to provide for constant real consumption. The analysis incorporated the relevant reductions and credits for early and late claiming, mortality risk, stochastic investment returns, and the availability of longevity insurance. Results provide guidance for financial planners to help clients make the optimal claiming decision.

Risks in Advanced Age: A Review of Research and Possible Solutions,"This paper reviews both published and emerging research on different risks retirees in advanced age face and possible solutions financial planners can use to help clients overcome behavioral hurdles. Risk assessment questions that measure loss aversion, as well as reducing myopic behavior, can help keep clients in portfolios that align with their preferences. Older people have an inclination to reject evidence of declining skills, but if financial planners make clients aware of their declining cognitive and financial literacy abilities before retirement, they may be more willing to choose simplified and satisfactory solutions. Longevity ""insurance"" can be an effective way to help clients spend more during their early retirement years, while protecting them against the tail risk of running out of money prior to death.

Living Late Life Well,"As financial planners, they help their clients with investment management, insurance needs, estate planning, budgeting, retirement and income planning, saving for college, tax planning, and other financial topics. All are critical areas in which they serve their clients to help them stay on track with their financial goals and needs. However, as clients age, other issues related to life and finances arise -- especially in later life. Often financial planners are unwilling or reluctant to address these issues as there have been few, if any, financial planning courses teaching them how to address questions. The complexity of life, cultural bias about discussing death and disability, and family dynamics often leave families to deal with these issues in crisis mode. Helping their clients and their families plan for and live late life well has a place in their offering as financial planners. Late-life planning adds depth to their planning services and positions them as true family advocates. Heirs will often see the value of retaining their services.","Hinds, J Lynn, CRC®, CKA", Journal Article,Aug,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Elder care , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Value of Communication in the Client-Planner Relationship,"This study explored how various types and frequencies of communication relate to client satisfaction, trust, and commitment. Results indicate that clients were generally more satisfied when they received higher frequencies of investment-related educational communications, greeting cards, personal notes, and scheduled meetings. Increased frequencies of investment-related educational communications were positively associated with the likelihood of continuing to use the planner in the future and the percentage of assets managed by the planner. Greater frequencies of noninvestment- related educational communications were associated with a larger number of referrals. Greeting cards and personal notes were found to be more relevant than non-investment-related educational communications when building client satisfaction and trust. The overuse of interest and hobby communications was found to result in lower levels of satisfaction, trust, and commitment. Scheduled meetings were positively and significantly associated with higher levels of satisfaction, trust, and commitment across all domains. The value of this type of communication appeared to top out at approximately four scheduled meetings per year.","Cheng, Yuanshan, PhD;Browning, Chris, PhD;Gibson, Philip, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,Aug,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Financial planning , Impact analysis , Communication , Client relationships , Meetings , Greeting cards",ProQuest One Academic

She was elated to find young planners -- and a bunch of them -- in the same room. It felt like an epiphany; she'd found her people. Over the course of that weekend in 2014, they used open space technology to brainstorm topics of discussion for slotted breakout sessions. One idea proposed was study groups. Former FPA NexGen president Jude Boudreaux, CFP, offered to facilitate the session. He shared his experience as a member of a study group and helped the attendees of that fateful session break off into like-minded groups. His study group members are the ultimate cheerleaders. They support and encourage each other, and celebrate one another's victories. In 2015, he decided to run for FPA NexGen president-elect.

How to Use Qualified Charitable Distributions as a Tax-Saving Tool,"Qualified charitable distributions (QCD) from individual retirement accounts (IRA) to qualified charities were first allowed in 2006, but it was a bi-annual planning question whether Congress would allow the transaction for another two years. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act) eliminated these concerns by permanently adding QCDs to the law starting in 2016. The QCD is not reported in income, and no charitable deduction is claimed. Although it seems like the result would be the same if the individual included the IRA distribution in income, contributed the distribution to charity, and then deducted the charitable contribution on his or her tax return, using a QCD is more beneficial in many scenarios. To qualify as a QCD, the distributions must be made to an organization that qualifies for a charitable deduction other than a private (grant-making) foundation, donor-advised fund, or charitable trust.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP®;Daff, Leslie, JD", Journal Article,Aug,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Charitable tax deductions , Tax legislation , Donations , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Tax increases , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

A 3-Step Procedure for Computing Sustainable Retirement Savings Withdrawals,"Retirement planning involves coordinating income from multiple sources such that savings are not depleted prematurely, no large undesired surplus is left behind, and disposable income is maximized. This paper proposes a practical retirement savings withdrawal procedure using a free online calculator that addresses these objectives. The procedure is called 3-PEAT. The heart of 3-PEAT is a linear programming application that computes an optimal retirement income management plan whose results include annual savings withdrawals and maximum disposable income for the term of the plan. The 3-PEAT requires that the retiree adapt to variable annual disposable income. The procedure increases withdrawals in rising markets and reduces withdrawals in down markets. Because it is a procedure, it is amenable to simulation. This paper analyzed 3-PEAT simulations for six historical stock market periods. Results show that when 3-PEAT was compared to other variable withdrawal methods, it increased disposable income, prevented savings from being depleted prematurely, and reduced the variability of annual disposable income.","Welch, James S, Jr", Journal Article,Aug,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Disposable income , Linear programming , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Savings , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

You are a fiduciary under ERISA if you do one of three things: 1. exercise discretion over the management plan or IRA assets; 2. render investment advice to a retirement investor for compensation; or 3. have any discretionary authority over the management or administration of the plan. If you are a fiduciary under ERISA, you can perform activities that are educational. If you're working with an ERISA Title 1 plan, educational activities include: providing information about the plan; general financial, investment, and retirement information; asset allocation models; and interactive investment materials.

Ryder said besides the obvious obligations with the SEC Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations that require the adviser protect their client data, it's a fiduciary responsibility to take care of your client data. He thinks it's critically important, whether there is regulation or not, that protecting client data is the responsibility of all of us, including any type of company that safeguards client data. He thinks the biggest risk is phishing. The Identity Theft Resource Center has a telling chart that shows all the different types of breaches -- brute force attacks, skimming, employee error, negligence. Employees should get cybersecurity training at least annually; preferably semi-annually, and if you want, on a quarterly basis.","Schulaka, Carly", Interview,Aug,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Internet crime , Data integrity , Federal regulation , Data encryption , Corporate presidents , Training , Computer security , Identity theft , Ryder, Steven , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Endowment Effect: Why Executives Love Their Company's Stock,"Senior corporate executives are a large segment of their firm's practice. As such, the merit of diversifying portfolios highly concentrated in company stock is a frequent discussion. Generally, the concentration builds over many years due to stock bonuses, deferred compensation, stock options, restricted stock grants, other corporate asset accumulation plans, and occasional market purchases. Sometimes companies mandate that senior executives hold a certain amount of stock, perhaps as a percentage of compensation. Even when this is a consideration, most executives have difficulty diversifying holdings beyond policy requirements. In the field of portfolio management, much has been written on the generally unfavorable risk/reward metrics of overly concentrated portfolios, especially when the concentration is in a single security. Most of their executive clients acknowledge that their portfolios are exposed to unsystematic market risks and readily agree that if they were counseling clients, they would recommend diversification. The behavioral aspects behind remaining highly concentrated in company stock are complicated.","Clarfeld, Robert A, CPA, CFP®", Journal Article,Aug,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Stocks , Portfolio diversification , Executive compensation , Executives , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

That's the climate people live in, with constant advertising campaigns from tech companies selling shiny new applications, features, and integrations that promise them the next big thing (not to mention the technology consultants and experts in the financial planning industry). What they lose sight of is that the key to technology solutions doesn't lie in flashy features or reports. It's in the skill and talent of your people and the strategy and service that you already provide. Here are some tips on how planners expect to use the tech to its maximum potential: 1.

According to Kochis, the biggest hurdle holding firm owners back from achieving a successful succession is the emotional impact. While this is the biggest stumbling block to actually making a successful transition, it's not the only one. The others are the operational readiness of the firm for a transition, and then the financial terms have to be acceptable to all the parties. It can't be one-sided. The importance of distinguishing management from ownership is that it permits founder/CEOs, or maybe sole owners, to distribute and begin to shed some of their ownership interest without necessarily relinquishing control, because the real emotional impact here is not about ownership; it's much more about control.","Schulaka, Carly", Interview,Jul,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Emotions , Success factors , Succession planning , Business ownership , Kochis, Tim , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Deducting the Costs of Long-Term-Care Expenses,"The costs of nursing and assisted living facilities continue to rise each year. With more than a million seniors residing in some type of nursing or assisted living facility, the ability to take a tax deduction for medical costs can help offset the cost of the care. Currently, taxpayers can deduct medical and dental expenses that are more than 10% of their adjusted gross income (of course, financial planners should keep an eye on legislation; a current proposal would eliminate medical expenses as an itemized deduction). Medical insurance reimbursements reduce the deductible amount. Self-employed taxpayers may be able to deduct 100% of their health insurance costs in arriving at adjusted gross income. Also, taxpayers using health savings accounts (HSA) may be able to use amounts in the HSA account to pay for medical expenses. Many people turn to insurance policies to help pay for some of the costs of long-term care.","Welch, Julie A, CPA, PFP, CFP®;Smith, Cara, CPA, CFP®", Journal Article,Jul,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Long term health care , Health care expenditures , Financial planners , Health savings accounts , Insurance policies , Cost control , Medical expense deduction , Health insurance , Long term care insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Integrating Behavioral Finance, Financial Psychology, and Financial Therapy into the 6-Step Financial Planning Process","Clients have strong emotions around their money, yet there is a tendency to focus solely on the economic aspects of a client's financial well-being. In their work with clients, many financial planners utilize CFP Board's six-step Financial Planning Practice Standards. Traditionally, this framework focuses on financial data-gathering and financial goals, and does not necessarily include the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of a client's money-related issues. This paper provides a framework for integrating behavioral finance, financial psychology, and financial therapy theory and tools into the six-step financial planning process to help planners provide more comprehensive and effective services. Financial planning stands to benefit greatly should the profession choose to adopt and integrate behavioral finance, financial psychology, and financial therapy theory and practices.","Lawson, Derek R, CFP®;Klontz, Bradley T, PsyD, CFP®", Journal Article,Jul,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Behavior , Client relationships , Training , Financial planning , Behavioral economics , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Make sure you and the grantor understand exactly what the trust document's purpose and specific provisions are prior to naming the trustee. 2. Ensure the prospective trustee understands your clients' family history. 3. Be sure to select prudent and accessible trustees who can carry out the provisions of the trust and manage investment, tax, accounting, legal, and interpersonal issues. 4.

It really was born of a number of things that were going on, both in the industry and her own life. First, she was taking a harder look at what success really looked like with advisers. For so many years she had focused almost exclusively on client engagement, and she had quite a narrow focus in that area. And she would have argued that client engagement is what makes people successful when they get it right. For a financial adviser, you are absolutely engaged if you have intentionally designed a business that is at that intersection of growth and fulfillment.

Investing after the End of the Golden Age,"The ""Golden Age"" of investing provided more than three decades of strong investment returns beginning in 1982. Despite two steep equity market corrections in the 1990s, the S&amp;P 500 Index provided double-digit annualized returns during the multi-decade rally. Bonds also rallied strongly, providing significant price appreciation as 10-year US Treasury yields declined from double-digit to low single-digit levels. Investors during the Golden Age benefited from market-friendly policy changes, favorable demographics, and increasing global trade. These positive factors served as tailwinds for stock and bond markets. However, many of the tailwinds are now becoming headwinds, and financial advisers and their clients will need to adapt to a less favorable outlook for markets. Today, many of the tailwinds from the Golden Age are becoming headwinds. Understanding these headwinds will help advisers best guide clients' investing decisions.

Emotions Matter: How Facial Coding Can Better Connect You to Your Clients,"An underlying premise of behavioral finance is the recognition that decision-making involves both System 1 and System 2 mental processes. The former is intuitive and emotional, and the latter more cognitive and rational. As neurobiology studies suggest that 70% of a person's decision-making process is emotionally driven. Their default -- because it's easier and more natural -- is to be more like Homer Simpson than Mr. Spock of Star Trek fame. A limitation with using mind-mapping or like-minded exercises to uncover a client's true emotional state is that, to the extent they explore emotions, they may actually traffic in feelings. Psychologists distinguish between emotions and feelings -- emotions subconsciously and spontaneously occur; feelings are cognitively filtered instances of self-reporting.

"A Model for Building a Lower-Cost Portfolio Using Active, Passive, and Smart Beta Products","The debate to invest actively or passively has engaged the financial industry since the early 1970s, when all equity investors were active investors. The publication of A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel in 1973, which presented an argument for passive investing understandable to the common investor, helped propel passive investing. In 2014, the amount of wealth invested passively by US investors eclipsed 20%. This represents a sizable shift in assets and thinking about investing. Moreover, the debate on whether to use passive or active investment strategies now includes a middle ground, smart beta strategies, which generally are transparent and rules-based like passive strategies while focused on achieving factor exposures or investment beliefs like active strategies. A commonly held belief is that one should invest passively where active opportunity is considered low, such as highly efficient markets like US large-cap equities, and invest actively where markets are less efficient and opportunity is high, such as emerging markets equities and small-cap equities.","Pittman, Sam, PhD", Journal Article,Jun,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Opportunity , Efficient markets , Portfolio investments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

RMD Arbitrage: Strategies for Legally Delaying and Reducing RMDs,"It has been widely acknowledged that, in most cases, the best use of an inherited IRA for a non-spouse is typically to use the ""stretch provisions"" to stretch out the distributions over the beneficiary's life expectancy, rather than taking a lump sum or a five-year distribution. The main principle behind the inherited IRA stretch strategy is that it allows the IRA assets to remain tax-deferred for the longest possible time frame. Therefore, younger beneficiaries, such as grandchildren and great-grandchildren, could stand to receive the greatest benefit from an inherited IRA, because they have a longer life expectancy over which required distributions may be stretched. Technically, it is not possible to change one's own required minimum distribution schedule. However, in a majority of American households, the age gap between the two spouses is greater than one year. The primary objective of this research was to determine whether age gaps created advantages for savings in a younger spouse's IRA relative to savings in the older spouse's IRA.","Vaughan, Caleb W, CFP®", Journal Article,Jun,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Tax deferred privileges , Beneficiaries , Life expectancy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
What Is Your Financial Planning Weakness?,"Most financial planners are quick to admit that they don't know much about property and casualty insurance (P&amp;C). Many dislike the fact that they had to learn about P&amp;C for the CFP certification examination, even though they had no interest in the topic and knew they would never be licensed for that type of insurance. Indeed, the common advice from planners regarding P&amp;C insurance is to find a good P&amp;C agent, which presumably exonerates the planner from any responsibility if something goes wrong. If you completed an approved education program, you should have been exposed to myriad insurance topics, including (P&amp;C) insurance for individuals and businesses. Still, few of them learn the topic well, and even fewer retain the information. Yet mistakes in the P&amp;C area can be catastrophic financially for your clients. An informed discussion about P&amp;C insurance topics with your clients is the right thing to do, because it is in their best interest.

Shifting societal needs are forecasting an unprecedented demand for professional financial planners over the coming years. The aging population, longevity risk, and the retirement income responsibility shift from employers to ill-equipped employees continue to drive demand. The US Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, in updating its Occupational Outlook Handbook, has projected an extremely positive job outlook for financial planners with a growth of 30% through 2024 -- much faster than related professions. Although demand is high, the future supply of quality financial planners is uncertain.

The Effect of Low Reverse Mortgage Literacy on Usage of Home Equity in Retirement Income Plans,"This article is designed to help financial advisers better understand the potential knowledge level and desires of their clients with regard to reverse mortgages and home equity as a retirement income source. Results of a 2016 survey of 1,000 Americans ages 55 to 75 are discussed, including attitudes toward home equity and retirement planning with a special focus on reverse mortgages. Survey respondents were quizzed on their reverse mortgage literacy; they performed poorly with an average score of 48%. The existence of a relationship with a financial adviser did not increase the likelihood the respondents would consider a reverse mortgage, nor did it increase their reverse mortgage knowledge. Overall, respondents did not have a positive view of reverse mortgages as a retirement income tool. Low literacy rates and negative opinions regarding reverse mortgages appear to be restricting wider usage of the product.","Hopkins, Jamie Patrick, JD, LLM, RICP®, ChFC®, CLU®", Journal Article,May,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Home equity loans , Financial planners , Financial literacy , Reverse mortgages , Retirement planning , Polls & surveys , Retirement income , Literacy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
It's Time to Reexamine Your Fee Schedule,The growth of the fee-based advice model has been one of the most significant developments in the financial planning profession over the last 30 years. They have gone from a world dominated by commissions to a world where advisers now derive more revenue from fees than from commissions. The trend toward fee-based advice has been driven primarily by a desire to find a business model that removes some of the conflicts of interest inherent in the commission-based model. Compensating an adviser based on a percentage of assets under management may remove the incentive to recommend unnecessary trades to generate a commission. But charging for advice based on a percentage of assets under management does not perfectly align an adviser's interests with the client's. The AUM pricing model also holds a subtler potential conflict.,"MacKillop, Scott", Commentary,May,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Fees & charges , Compensation , Asset management , Business models , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Can Institutional Style Factor Analysis Benefit Retail Wealth Management?,"Traditionally, when advisers think about portfolio construction and drivers of risk, they think in terms of asset classes. However, in the institutional investment space, more and more asset allocators and risk managers are thinking in terms of factors instead of asset classes. Start with a discussion of the difference between factors and asset classes. Strictly speaking, factors are underlying drivers of risk and return while asset classes are groupings of similar types of investments. Put another way, an investment's asset class is usually part of a family of investments, such as equities, debt, or cash. Factors are different in that they are drivers of return instead of groups of assets, examples being inflation, the US dollar, or interest rates. In his 2013 article on factor investing (""Risk Factors as Building Blocks for Portfolio Diversification: The Chemistry of Asset Allocation,"" published by the CFA Institute), Callahan Associates' Eugene Podkaminer described factors as atoms and assets as molecules.","Wakeman, Kendrick, CFA", Journal Article,May,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Discriminant analysis , Asset allocation , Risk management , Wealth management , Institutional investments , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The top predictors of financial conflict for husbands included perceptions of a spendy wife, having financial worries, reporting a lower income, having three or more children, and having a wife who thinks he is too spendy. The top predictors of financial conflict for wives included having a husband who thinks she is too spendy, feeling a lack of communication with her husband, having financial worries, having a husband with low income, and having perceptions of a spendy husband.

Dick Wagner on Why Financial Planning Is the Most Important Profession of the Century,"In an interview, financial planning pioneer Richard B. ""Dick"" Wagner, J.D., CFP, talked about why financial planning is the most important profession of the century. According to Wagner, for planners, he thinks there are actually two key points. One is that money is the most powerful and pervasive secular force on the planet, which speaks to huge responsibility. And two, that they are generating the most important profession of the 21st century. He wants people to wonder about that, but he wants them to also be open to the possibility that this is a true statement; he believes it is. He first made that statement years ago in the speeches he made when he was president of the ICFP [a predecessor organization of FPA]. He puts it in there as a method of thinking aspirationally about the importance of financial planning, but he has thought a lot about it since. He thinks maybe what needs to be updated are the attributes of a quality and qualified personal financial adviser.","Yeske, Dave, DBA, CFP®", Interview,May,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Philosophy , Personal profiles , Professions , Personal finance , Financial planning , Wagner, Dick , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Transforming from ROI-Centric Planning to Return on Life Planning,"The financial planning profession has made several transformations over the past few decades. Prior to 1980, most financial advisers were brokers who sold stocks and bonds on commission. During the 1980s and 1990s, stocks gave way to mutual funds and asset allocation. Today, prodded by the millennial generation, they're seeing a strong movement toward redefining money. As Daniel Pink pointed out in his 2005 book, A Whole New Mind, the value propositions of the future are going to be rooted and grounded in the right side of the brain, meaning that the human element is what people are willing to pay for. Everything else is going to eventually become commoditized. In financial planning, the human element is best expressed in the discovery and review processes. The traditional financial advice path and focus has been on numbers and returns (return on investment, or ROI). The Return on Life (ROL) model subordinates ROI into a tertiary value, existing only to support ROL and highly personalized planning.","Anthony, Mitch;Sanduski, Steve, CFP®", Journal Article,May,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Return on investment , Personal finance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Early efforts to integrate psychology with finance focused on behavioral finance. Behavioral finance is built on the premise that human beings don't always act in their best financial interests. Practicing financial planners, who frequently witness clients act against their own interests, intuitively understand this.

What Celebrities Can Teach Us about Estate Planning,"It is interesting how the common estate planning mistakes of average clients are so often replicated and exaggerated in celebrity situations. This column will discuss some of the things the authors can learn from high-profile celebrity estates, recognizing that their typical clients receive much less media attention and, often enough, have a few less zeros on their estate values. It is not that celebrity estates are more confounding than your average client's estate. It's that most celebrities have been allotted more than 15 minutes of media time, with much of it collected after they die. Dying without a will doesn't damage the deceased, but it sure makes it hard on the survivors. Abraham Lincoln was shot on Apr 14, 1865. He died the next morning without a will despite being a skilled and successful attorney. He left an estate of $110,296.80. Unfortunately, a significant number of Americans seem to be following Paul Simon's perspective from his 1965 song Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall: ""So I'll continue to continue to pretend that my life will never end.""","Scroggin, John J, AEP, JD, LLM", Journal Article,May,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Celebrities , Death & dying , Financial planning , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Science of Helping Clients Change,"Much like an NBA start playing basketball, the great change agents in their lives have raw talent and great instincts. But never underestimate the fundamentals -- as Michael Jordan said, ""Get the fundamentals down, and the level of everything you do will rise."" Psychologist Roy F. Baumeister studies a lot about human behavior, including what they call ""willpower""and what he calls ""self-regulation."" His studies have found that willpower acts like a muscle: if you use it, over time it gets stronger. In the short run, it depletes. Baumeister's research also teaches two important lessons about willpower. First, before making a tough decision or performing a task that requires willpower, find a way to replenish it. Second, don't rely on willpower any more than you have to; instead, leverage good habits and rules. The key is to make the rule simple and clear. Ambiguity makes it easier for the human brain to make deals with itself for why an exception is okay. Also, try some limited-time experiments.","Birke, Kol, CFP®", Cover Story,May,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Motivation , Behavior , Financial planners , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Advice for Next-Generation Advisers Looking for Ownership,"The author talks to a lot of financial advisers about succession planning.

But he doesn't meet some financial advisers' expectations of a succession planning expert. When he first started presenting on these topics, he was introduced as the ""boy wonder of succession planning"" in front of an audience of about 200 senior advisers. The first piece of advice he has for G2s is: try to imagine yourself in G1's position and see the opportunity from the founder's perspective.

Bootstrapping simulation techniques provided the basis for the analysis, and the results serve to clarify and quantify the relative impact of each of the six factors.

Because Retirees Aren't Spreadsheets,"Retirees often cover ongoing living expenses with Social Security and any pension benefits. If these sources aren't enough, they are sometimes advised to cover the rest by using assets to purchase guaranteed sources of inflation-adjusted income, such as bond ladders or single premium immediate annuities (SPIA). Depending which they choose, the use of retirement savings to fund these ""essential"" expenses can be an irrevocable decision. The amount of capital required to fund each real dollar of such lifetime spending is about $30. Consider the financial planning implications of this, beginning with the amount of capital needed to fund essential or core lifestyle spending. This, of course, directly determines what's available for items that don't meet the definition of core spending. But even with this adjustment to the core-discretionary spending dichotomy, there could still be unintended lifestyle costs.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®", Journal Article,Apr,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Single premium annuities , Financial planning , Social security , Retirees , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Impact of Guaranteed Income and Dynamic Withdrawals on Safe Initial Withdrawal Rates,"Optimal safe initial withdrawal rates can differ significantly across relatively similar retiree household scenarios and to a much larger extent than has been commonly noted in retirement income research. Important variables to consider are the amount of guaranteed income, the extent to which the household can adjust consumption, the risk of the investment portfolio, the return assumptions used for projections, and the degree of income stability desired by the retiree. Guaranteed income had the largest impact on the estimated safe initial withdrawal rates among the variables considered. Those withdrawal rates varied by more than 4% points for different levels of guaranteed income. Although recent research using forward-looking returns suggested that 3% is a more appropriate safe initial withdrawal rate for retirees today, this analysis suggested that 4% is likely still a much better starting place for many retirees, although the optimal target varies considerably.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®", Journal Article,Apr,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Regression analysis , Financial planners , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Retirees , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Cognitive Decline: The Importance of Awareness and Advance Planning,"For an aging population, cognitive decline is an unnerving challenge on numerous levels. Expected longevity has jumped more than 10% since 2000, according to the Society of Actuaries. The average 65-year-old man can be expected to live into his mid-80s, one-fourth live past age 90, and 10% live past 95. The average 65-year-old-woman has an even longer life expectancy. Affluent individuals have actuarial life expectancies beyond the averages and often have complex financial considerations requiring high levels of cognitive function. Although increased life spans bring great benefits, the potential for cognitive decline is an important consideration for financial advisers. Dementia is defined as the loss of cognitive and mental functions severe enough to impair a person's daily functioning, and estimates indicate that nearly 15% of Americans over age 70 suffer from some form of dementia.

Developing a Framework to Craft a Value Proposition,"Value proposition serves as the starting point for every marketing activity, prospecting strategy, and client service activity. And yet, very few planners talk about their practice in a unique way. But, the few planners who do articulate their value find tremendous success. The majority of planners tend to be logical and analytical. They like numbers and math. These are the crucial left-brain attributes needed to be a successful planner. Yet, to be a successful marketer requires a strong dose of right-brain attributes, especially creativity. This could explain why so many planners struggle to describe their value in a way in which the prospective client could relate. This article proposes a new framework to develop a value proposition by taking a logical, analytical, left-brain approach to solving the problem. This new approach contrasts sharply with many other articles and books that use an approach geared toward planners who exhibit more right-brain attributes.","Lecours, Mike, CFP®", Feature,Mar,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Creativity , Valuation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Selling a Planning Practice: The Relationship between Revenue Multiple and Revenue Size,"The combination of large numbers of financial advisers reaching retirement age and the fact that most financial planning practices do not have succession plans in place, means the topic of succession planning remains an important one for the financial planning profession. Assuming an average retirement age of 68, an estimated 8,600 financial advisers will reach retirement age each year for the next several years, according to Cerulli. To successfully exit a financial planning practice requires the owner(s) to meet not only industry regulations, but also their own retirement needs. Previous literature has indicated many rules of thumb in determining the fair market value of a practice. But limited empirical studies have offered analysis of these rules of thumb to help owners determine their succession or exit needs.

Using Bonds to Meet Retirement Expenses,"Bonds can be incorporated directly into a retirement income strategy as a way to meet retirement expenses in three broad ways. The first is an assets-only approach to build a total returns investment portfolio. Two additional methods put the retirement liability (meeting an ongoing spending goal in retirement) at the forefront and will try to choose bonds to best protect the spending plan from interest rate volatility. These include matching the duration of bond funds to the duration of the retirement liability, and holding individual bonds to maturity to generate the desired cash flows to fund expenses on an ongoing basis throughout retirement. Bonds may provide other roles in a retirement income plan, such as creating liquidity for unexpected expenses. But the focus in this article has been on using bonds to meet expected expenses, and these are the three basic options available for advisers.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Commentary,Mar,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment income , Bonds , Budgets , Investment policy , Retirement planning , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Planning for a More Expensive Retirement,"Many financial planning assumptions are based on historical returns; however, these historical returns may not be relevant in the future. Prices of bonds and stocks are much higher than in the recent past, suggesting a greater likelihood that portfolio returns will fall below the assumptions commonly used by planners. This study explored how lower expected returns affect optimal saving and spending during working years, retirement replacement rates, retirement lifestyles, and the cost of bequests. Future real returns on financial assets are an important unknown that may be seen as following a continuum from reasonably certain (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) to unknown (stocks). Advisers need to estimate future returns on riskier securities, and typically draw from past risky asset returns to project the future. Rather than set returns at historical averages, bond returns should be set at today's yield curve, and equity returns should be adjusted for the lower risk-free rate and reduced equity premium.","Blanchett, David, PhD, CFP®, CFA;Finke, Michael S, PhD, CFP®;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Mar,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Investment policy , Expected returns , Bequests , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Understanding Business-Related Education Costs,"The IRC provides tax incentives to help offset the costs of higher education in a variety of forms such as above-the-line deductions for tuition and fees and student loan interest, the American opportunity tax credit, the lifetime learning credit, and college savings plans such as 529 plans. Perhaps you are pursuing a graduate degree or have clients who are doing the same. Having an employer sponsor or pay for business-related courses is the best option for an employee, because those benefits can often be structured so they are tax free to the employee. Similar to work-related deductions such as business auto mileage and supplies, work-related education expenses are also allowable deductions. The lifetime learning credit and the above-the-line deduction for tuition and fees are also available for professionals with business-related education expenses. However, they start to phase out for those with incomes over certain amounts. A credit reduces the amount of tax you owe, and a deduction reduces the amount of income subject to tax.","Welch, Julie A, CPA, PFP, CFP®;Smith, Cara, CPA, CFP®", Commentary,Mar,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Academic degrees , Education expenses , Qualified tuition programs , Cost control , Tax credits , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Retirement Income Showdown: Risk Pooling Versus Risk Premium,"Different groups within the financial services profession continue to debate about the best approach to building a retirement income plan. Pfau (2014) identified two general philosophies about retirement income: the probability-based and safety-first schools of thought. A key issue of disagreement between these sides is about where retirees are best served in placing their focus and trust: in the risk/ reward trade-offs and upside potential of a stock portfolio (probability-based), or in the contractual guarantee of income annuities (safety first). This analysis aimed to test these competing approaches to provide greater clarity about the role of risk pooling (income annuities) and risk premium (stocks) in a retirement income plan. The theory for retirement income planning used in this research was informed from multiple sources. First, Branning and Grubbs (2010) proposed a framework for thinking about retirement income in terms of household liabilities and asset-liability matching. Retirees must decide how much risk to their lifestyle they are willing to accept.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Feb,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement plans , Risk premiums , Financial services , Retirees , Annuities , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"To Enhance Lifetime Retirement Security, Use Reverse Mortgages or Immediate Annuities?","This paper reviews how reverse mortgages work, with a focus on costs, taxation, and possible use in enhancing lifetime retirement security through tenure payments. A recent article in the financial planning literature found that tenure payments from a reverse mortgage effectively and efficiently balance income and bequest needs of a retired household. For those retired households who have both significant retirement assets and housing equity, the question remains whether they should use reverse mortgages based on their housing equity or immediate life annuities based on their retirement assets. The answer lies, in part, in an empirical analysis done here with note of costs and current market conditions, using standard calculators. Results show that for three timeframes with different interest rate levels, the life annuity produced higher income for individuals of almost all ages and both genders in retirement, while for couples, the reverse mortgage produced generally higher incomes, although the income from the annuity improves relatively when the age spread among the couple widens and as they are older.","Warshawsky, Mark J, PhD", Feature,Feb,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Retirement , Mortgages , Life annuities , Reverse mortgages , Income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Curbing Client Risk with Cyber Insurance,"One of the basic steps comprehensive planners engage in when preparing a financial plan for a client is conducting a risk management assessment. Risk management is an essential component in a well-constructed financial plan, and risk management measures are usually implemented early in the planning process. Without an adequate risk management plan in place, the benefits resulting from saving and investing to reach client goals for education funding, retirement, and legacy planning may be wiped out if the client experiences a negative risk exposure. A relatively new risk that business-owner clients are exposed to is financial loss resulting from a cyber breach. The evolution of the Internet and online electronic payment mechanisms have greatly expanded the potential for many businesses in a relatively short period of time, but it has also provided an opportunity for cyber thieves to steal information vital to the operation of those businesses, and vital to the customers who patronize them.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®, CLU®;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA, CFP®", Feature,Feb,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Funding , Clients , Risk management , Insurance coverage , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Incorporating Long-Term Care and Estate Planning Into Ultimate Life Insurance Trusts,"As a planner, strategize ahead your clients on the need for appropriate long-term care (LTC) insurance coverage with premiums significantly increasing and several insurers departing the LTC business over the last several years to ensure that your clients do not have to potentially draw down their estates for unexpected and prolonged LTC events. Most importantly, you should be selective with solutions for LTC coverage and seek more flexibility than what is typically offered with the features of traditional LTC policies. Talk to your clients who already have ample savings to cover LTC, since they can use the life insurance to create a tax-free bucket. This hybrid or linked-benefit life insurance policy eliminates the risk inherent in traditional LTC policies for clients who pay prodigious premiums for coverage they hope to never use.

What his company knows about financial advisers is they typically do business with people who are 10 years older or 10 years younger than them. What makes a financial adviser ""gen-savvy"" is when they understand their own generational biases that come out of their coming-of-age years and how they are generationally unique.

Making Research Meaningful to Clients,"One of the ways financial planning is moving from an industry to a profession is through research conducted by university academics in conjunction with financial planning practitioners. College programs now exist across the country, and best practices are moving from intuition to evidence-based financial planning. This is important news, and planners should be sharing it with their clients. Showing their clients that they base their practices in research and theory is important for many reasons. Making the commitment to sharing theory and research with their clients only addresses half of the potential problem. Sometimes equally problematic is fostering interest in their clients. Most importantly, theory and research in a planning practice needs to be holistic and inclusive. A great place to start is in your marketing department. Although it seems counterintuitive, research can be an excellent marketing tool for your firm.

Dollar-Cost Averaging Using the CAPE Ratio: An Identifiable Trend Influencing Outperformance,"Investment advisers have continued to practice dollar-cost averaging despite its demonstrated inferior returns compared to lump-sum investing. However, lump-sum investing has not conclusively eclipsed dollar-cost averaging; it has outperformed dollar-cost averaging only two-thirds of the time. Certain periods of flat stock market performance, and downward-trending markets point to the superior nominal investment return with dollar-cost averaging. This study sought to identify an environmental pattern in dollar-cost averaging's higher returns over lump-sum investing. The investment returns of the lump-sum investing strategy and the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy were compared for rolling 15-year periods. Historic cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio metrics were sourced from Robert Shiller's webpage at Yale University. Ten- and five-year periods were also tested, but 15 years was used because it enabled the greatest chance for the outperformance by DCA. The results failed to reject the null hypothesis: CAPE ratio valuations above 18.6 proved to provide, on average, superior nominal investment returns when using DCA.","Luskin, Jon M, CFP®", Feature,Jan,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Lump sum , Investment advisors , Return on investment , Portfolio investments , Investments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Master Your Return on Effort: How to increase revenue, decrease effort, and amplify fulfillment in your practice","Too many advisers linger in a state of mediocre fulfillment, unsure what to do next to spring from their current plateau. Stuck in their status quo, they are unable to envision new possibilities to achieve what they want from their business. To maintain a sustainable business, you need cash flow to cover business expenses and the necessary personal expenses that your income funds. Revenue over that baseline provides for savings and retirement, donations, gifts, luxury personal expenses, child or parent support, and whatever else you choose. To increase your revenue, you must focus on marketing. Marketing is more than creating awareness to generate action; it spans from that first impression through developing deep client loyalty and inspiring ambassadors. Here are four ways to improve your revenue: 1. Attract more high-quality leads. 2. Improve your conversions. 3. Increase engagement of your clients. Revisit your pricing and service offering.","Harad, Kristin, CFP®", Feature,Jan,2017,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Financial planners , Sustainability , Profit maximization , Income funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Preparing for an End-of-Career Transition: How to address the emotional and logistical aspects of succession planning,"As they near the end of their careers, financial advisers often lament that succession planning is a complex, difficult process. There is the technical aspect of succession planning that involves finding the right buyer, valuing the business, negotiating the deal, and executing the arrangement; but for many advisers, the more difficult aspect is accepting the fact that a long, rewarding career is winding down. To make a successful transition to retirement, it's important to address both sides of the equation-emotional and logistical. Once you've done the emotional and psychological work of readying yourself for retirement -- in whatever form it may take -- the logistical work of readying the practice for transition is likely to go more smoothly. Identifying your successor is the first critical step in the year or two after you have prepared yourself for a transition. Your career as an adviser may no longer be a work in progress, but your contributions to the world still are.","King, Maria Considine;Youngwirth, Joni", Feature,Dec,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Careers , Succession planning , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

From predictions that artificial intelligence, white-label robo-services, and big data will transform how they as advisers operate and work with clients, to the potential that voice recognition technology like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa will be the next iteration for how investors get advice, they are being bombarded with future visions for our industry that depending on who you are-are either super exciting or downright terrifying.

Planning for Your Clients' Care with Advance Directives,"Advance medical directives outline the kind of medical care that your clients would want in the event that they someday become incapacitated due to a serious accident or terminal illness. Unfortunately, some clients have not taken advantage of advance directives and the opportunity to control their futures. An advance medical directive generally has two parts: the health care proxy and a living will. The health care proxy, or durable power of attorney for health care, designates someone, such as a spouse or trusted friend, who can legally act as an agent and make medical decisions for your clients if they are incapacitated. The living will portion of an advance medical directive delineates the type of treatment your clients would want if they become critically ill and further specifies your clients' wishes in terms of end-of-life care.

Professional services firms connect an adviser's work effort to the business. Essentially, the adviser and the business become one. Like a financial budget that allocates limited monetary resources to the most important priorities, a time budget ensures that a business's essential tasks are completed on time and within the optimal operating range.

Helping Clients Weigh the NUA Distribution Decision,"Clients who are approaching retirement are often tasked with navigating myriad decisions with respect to their qualified and non-qualified retirement and employee benefit plans. And once in retirement, retirees must make critical choices as to which retirement assets to withdraw to meet their everyday living expenses. As a financial planner serving this demographic, it is vital to counsel clients and provide a thoughtful analysis on their retirement distribution options in order to maximize cash flow and preserve after-tax wealth. The following considerations should be explored when considering net unrealized appreciation (NUA) as a part of a client's retirement distribution plan: 1. tax rates, 2. the amount of NUA and cost basis, 3. time horizon, 4. diversification, 5. creditor protection, 6. charitable giving, and 7. estate planning. Although the NUA election may not be fitting in every situation, it is always an important consideration for financial planners to analyze whenever an employee departs from service holding company stock in a qualified retirement plan.","Westley, Robert A, CPA/PFS, CFP®", Feature,Dec,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Donations , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Using Neuroeconomics to Help Clients Make the Right Financial Decisions,"Many clients became overwhelmed when faced with decisions regarding their investments, family security, or taxes. And sometimes, they avoided making a decision altogether, which put them at risk. As a result, financial advisers started studying neuroeconomics -- the combination of economics, neuroscience, and psychology -- and its impact on how clients make economic decisions. In order for the client to make a good decision, a direct connection between the financial information being presented and the area in a client's brain that can make the most sense of that concept is needed. The adviser must ensure everything comes together at that perfect moment when a client needs to make the right decision. Delivering a consistent client experience is paramount. A successful financial adviser knows that numbers are the means to the story. The story is about a person's life and their ability to make financial decisions to make it a better, safer, and happier one.","Hamowy, Charles, CFP®, CPA/PFS;Conigliaro, Christopher, CFP®", Feature,Nov,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Neuropsychology , Client relationships , Economics , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Equity Yield Curves, Time Segmentation, and Portfolio Optimization Strategies","Time is a critical component in personal financial planning. Lifetimes can be broken up into a sequence of years, each with its own specific spending need. Good planning typically requires segmenting life on a year-by-year basis and taking appropriate actions to fund each year. Many investors must take on equity exposure to improve the probability of achieving a portfolio sufficient to cover lifetime financial goals. As with bonds, it makes sense that the equity portion of the investor's portfolio should also align with the investor's spending needs, albeit the longer dated spending needs. In this paper, three equity strategies were examined to determine which would be more consistent with a time segmentation approach and better support the goals of a financial plan and perhaps work better from a behavioral perspective as well. The three equity strategies were tested over 40 different holding periods (one-year, two-year, etc., up to 40-year holding periods) to estimate the effect of the length of the holding period on performance.","Huxley, Stephen J, PhD;Burns, J Brent;Fletcher, Jeremy, CFA", Feature,Nov,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Bond portfolios , Yield , Equity , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

It's a myth to believe that discovery's an upfront process. The thing that drives him crazy about the ROI value proposition is that it's done on a comparative basis. It's relative investment performance. Now, return on life is getting the best life possible with the money you have; managing your money in a way that optimizes your life.

Both types of loans must be secured by your primary or second home for the interest to be deductible. Some tax planning considerations to keep in mind when advising clients are: 1. Couples considering marriage and home ownership, especially in high-cost housing areas, should be aware of the mortgage interest deduction limitations as a married couple and as co-inhabitants of the residence. 2. Amended returns can be filed. 3.

This analysis demonstrated the differences between commonly used Monte Carlo simulations that assumed a withdrawal based on a fixed mortality period and initial capital, versus a model that integrated an actuarial withdrawal methodology recasting simulations at the beginning of each year, and for each iteration within each Monte Carlo simulation.

Helping Clients Understand Their Longevity Risk,"Longevity risk in retirement is the risk of running out of assets before running out of life. A longer life is wonderful, but it is also costlier. Your clients may live longer than they expect. Popular discussions of longevity risk tend to underestimate it for three general reasons as it relates to the circumstances of your clients: 1. Life expectancy may not be measured from the relevant age. 2. Life expectancy may be calculated from current year mortality rates instead of projected future mortality rates. 3. The underlying population for which mortality and survivorship is being calculated may not be relevant for your clients. There are two general methods for managing longevity risk. The first is to decide on a conservative planning age.

Incorporating Financial Risk Tolerance Research into the Financial Planning Process,"When working with a client to create a long-term financial plan, three important risk factors must be considered: 1. risk need; 2. risk capacity; and 3. financial risk tolerance (Carr 2014; Nobre and Grable 2015). Financial risk tolerance is a more subjective measure that reflects an individual's willingness to accept uncertainty related to the outcome of a financial decision (Grable 2000). As an individual's comfort level with such uncertainty increases, their financial risk tolerance goes up. Risk aversion is another term sometimes used instead of financial risk tolerance. Risk aversion represents the inverse of financial risk tolerance. The more risk averse a person is, the lower their comfort level with financial uncertainty. The need for a financial planner to consider a client's financial risk tolerance is well documented in the literature and often required to meet various professional standards and regulations.","Ryack, Kenneth N, PhD, CFP®, CPA;Kraten, Michael, PhD, CPA;Sheikh, Aamer, PhD, CPA, CRFA, CFC®, CGMA®", Feature,Oct,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Professional standards , Risk aversion , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Clients with taxable estates that include closely held businesses and/or real estate often engage in discounting strategies to reduce the impact of the gift and estate tax.

He held this colleague in very high esteem. To his surprise, he expressed frustration that his presentation was met with a lack of enthusiasm by the planners. The general conclusion from this group of practitioners confirmed his academic colleague's conference experience. For the most part, financial planning research doesn't matter to financial planners. Here are three recommendations based on his observations as both a financial planning practitioner and an academic to help bridge the science-practice gap, so that they can ensure that their financial planning research does matter: 1. Leave campus. 2. Focus on practice, not personality. 3. For financial planning research to matter, research ideas need to be generated by, or in collaboration with, practitioners.","Klontz, Bradley T, PsyD, CFP®", Feature,Oct,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Self esteem , Guidelines , Client relationships , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
2017 Budget Proposals Take Aim at Life Insurance,"Earlier this year, Pres Obama presented his 2017 budget proposal to Congress. Commonly known as the ""Green Book,"" the budget proposal includes a number of measures that appear to be loophole closers designed to raise revenue for the federal government. As in prior years, the Green Book includes several provisions that affect insurance companies and consumers. Planners should be aware of these proposals and the potential impact they may have on clients. One proposal that could affect consumers of life insurance involves a change to the transfer-for-value rule. One of the benefits purchasers of life insurance receive is the ability to transfer the death benefit on the policy to the named beneficiary free of federal income tax. Upon the sale of a policy, the transfer-for-value rule is invoked, and the death benefit received by the beneficiary is subject to income tax to the extent it exceeds the owner's basis in the policy.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®, CLU®;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA, CFP®", Feature,Oct,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Provisions , Financial planners , Insurance policies , Client relationships , Insurance companies , Budgets , Life insurance , Income taxes , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Michael Finke on the Truth about Retirement Spending, the Annuity Puzzle, and Changing the Paradigm","In an interview, The American College dean and chief academic officer Michael Finke, Ph.D., CFP, talked about his current research projects, his views on the future of education in the planning profession, his insight on effective retirement income planning, and his ideas for bridging the research-practice gap. Finke said the role of higher education in any knowledge profession is to identify best practices through research and then relay the current understanding of that body of knowledge to students and practitioners. A realization that he came to while at Texas Tech is the importance of online applied education in general. To him, that is going to be how professional education is provided in the 21st century -- through high-quality and innovative online delivery.

Serving High Net Worth Clients through Wealth Preservation,"For many financial advisory firms, effectively serving high net worth (HNW) clients -- who are often a small but important segment of their client base -- is a top concern. Adviser-applied variable universal life insurance (AAVUL) is a relatively new tool available to advisers to help meet a variety of HNW clients' wealth planning needs while also creating business benefits for the firm. Some advisers have had difficult experiences with retail-priced variable universal life (VUL) products. Therefore, this article serves to educate advisers on the advances AAVUL can bring to the planning and execution process for certain clients, as well as situations where AAVUL is not appropriate for others. In US Trust's 2016 ""Insights on Wealth and Worth"" survey, 55% of HNW respondents (with at least $3 million in investable assets) stated that it's more important to minimize the impact of taxes when making investment decisions than it is to pursue the highest possible returns regardless of the tax consequences.","Loury, Kirk", Feature,Oct,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Variable life insurance , Polls & surveys , Universal life , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Guardrails to Prevent Potential Retirement Portfolio Failure,"A primary objective of any retirement plan is to ensure that the retiree does not run out of money. To provide guidance on how to achieve that goal, numerous researchers have defined various safe withdrawal strategies, and financial institutions have created calculators designed to forecast a retiree's assets and income over time. And yet, better ways to manage withdrawals are still being sought (Updegrave 2016). The research presented here took an in-depth look at the failures arising from using several retirement withdrawal strategies. Failure scenarios describe situations where a retiree ran out of money. Examining these failures can provide valuable insight into early warning signs of a future failure. These early warning signs can then be used to establish guardrails that modify a retirement strategy by providing corrective action to avoid failure. Guardrails are an easy-to-follow system to avoid portfolio failures.","Klinger, William J", Feature,Oct,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Failure analysis , Financial planners , Withdrawals , Retirement plans , Client relationships , Retirees , Failure , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

3 Steps to Helping Clients Manage Health Care Costs in Retirement,"The cost of health care in retirement gets a fair share of publicity. Enough so that many people say it's their No. 1 retirement concern. But health care is only the fourth-highest spending category for people between ages 65 and 74, after housing, transportation, and food. Fifty-three percent of pre-retirees surveyed by Nationwide Financial said it's important that their financial adviser talk to them about health care costs in retirement, yet only 10% of survey respondents said they have talked to a financial adviser about how to manage those costs. Planners can begin to bridge this gap with three relatively simple steps: 1. Make one-time estimates of how much clients might pay for their retirement health care. 2. Encourage retired clients to monitor and re-evaluate their coverage each year during Medicare's annual open enrollment period. 3. Suggest that clients track their health care expenses.","Armes, David, CFP®", Cover Story,Oct,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Health care expenditures , Financial planners , Polls & surveys , Guidelines , Retirement plans , Costs , Health care policy , Retirement , Long term care insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Young and Indebted: A Closer Look at the Future of Young Professionals,"Financial planners can work closely with young clients to combat worries about planning for the future by following a few recommendations. Planners need to make themselves available, not just at universities or in the workplace, but also to high school students. Educating high school seniors, in particular, before they attend college can be beneficial because it helps them understand the importance of money and develop an appetite to save. With this exposure before college, they will be able to borrow wisely and not be in debt after they complete their undergraduate degree. Work with companies to establish ""just-in- time"" training sessions on financial planning topics for their new employees. This recommendation is perhaps best suited for planners who work in large companies or at government agencies. ""Just-in-time"" training is appropriate for new employees, especially when they are receiving a new salary and not sure what to do with their new income when it comes to retirement savings.","Concepcion, John N", Feature,Sep,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Work environment , Training , New employees , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Why It Makes Sense to Build a Next Generation Practice,"Everyone has seen the statistics related to the aging financial adviser. The average age of a financial adviser, depending on what study you look at, is anywhere between 55 and 60. Over the next 10 years, more of these advisers will exit the profession than will invest in building next generation practices. It's hard to argue against advisers wanting to exit and take short-term risk off the table, because having a longer-term view requires greater investment and risk. More investors will need advice in the future, not less. More assets will be in play going forward, and even if fees compress, the firms with effective asset-gathering programs will be armed to gain a disproportionate share of the assets and revenue in motion. There are some certainties in the world: the sky is blue, and financial planning is moving to the center of the financial adviser's value proposition. As this happens, the use of technology becomes even more paramount in advisory practices.","Hummel, Jay", Feature,Sep,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Technology adoption , Revenue , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Research by CFP Board found that 72% of the women CFP professionals surveyed reported that they enjoyed their jobs, versus 46% of women advisers who did not hold the certification. For women in general, however, the CFP certification is the proverbial light under a bushel basket: shining brightly but largely disregarded. The percentage of CFP professionals who are women has flatlined at 23% for the last decade. As girls or high school students, they probably never met or talked to a female financial planner. As part of its WIN study, CFP Board compiled a survey of the characteristics of men and women financial advisers and found that the average female adviser is younger, less experienced, and less entrepreneurial than the average male adviser.","Blayney, Eleanor, CFP®", Feature,Sep,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Women , Certification , Polls & surveys , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

A Dynamic Yield Curve-Based Approach to Retiree Portfolio Allocation,"This study tested the hypothesis that an annual rebalancing of a client's portfolio would benefit from consideration of yield curve status when deciding upon the appropriate portfolio allocation. Results indicate that a simple dynamic reallocation strategy could help retirees increase their safe withdrawal rates considerably. An adjustment to reduce equity portfolio risk in certain years appeared to allow increased equity portfolio risk exposure in years in which the yield curve was not inverted, supporting an increased withdrawal rate. Using historical returns from 1926 to 2014, it was seen that when a valuation-based strategy that employed the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio to inform the annual portfolio rebalancing was combined with reducing equity exposure when the yield curve was inverted, the safe withdrawal rate was further increased.","Fink, Jason D, PhD;Fink, Kristin E, PhD", Feature,Sep,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Retirees , Price earnings ratio , Portfolio management , Risk exposure",ProQuest One Academic

It should also include a shared understanding of our history; where they came from and how they evolved to look the way they do. Those first elements are well covered by academic programs and continuing professional education, but a shared sense of history fades unless periodically refreshed. It feels like the time for a refresh has arrived, and so the author is taking this opportunity to offer a concise history of the financial planning profession as he understands it.

What Active ETFs Say about the Future of Active Management,"A lot of people have written off actively managed ETFs, and for good reason. Compared to the traditional world of mutual funds, actively managed ETFs are pathetic. While 78% of mutual fund assets are actively managed, that number is just over 1% for ETFs. Hardly worth mentioning. Studying where actively managed ETFs have succeeded is the best possible way to understand what active will look like in the future. ETFs operate in the market of the future -- one where products are bought based on their merits and not based on aggressive sales efforts alone. As such, ETFs are a canary in the coal mine for the active fund industry. And that canary has a lot to say. Here are four insights to be gained from studying the growth of actively managed ETFs: 1. Active is best received in illiquid markets. 2. Active works best in specialist areas. 3. Celebrity and style still matter in active. 4.

A Quiet Advocacy: Preparing Clients for a Change in Tax Filing Status,"Financial planners sometimes describe themselves as advocates for their clients. In such a capacity, they advocate for current decisions and strategies that clients in their future life would want themselves to follow today if only they knew now what they will know then. Of course, none of them can know today what them will tomorrow; however, they can certainly advocate for the positions in which their clients might hope to find themselves. As all US financial planners know, a single taxpayer reaches each tax bracket at a far lower income than a taxpayer who is a married couple filing jointly. Most importantly, this happens twice as quickly when moving from the 15% federal bracket to the next bracket, 25%. It's the biggest jump in the tax code. Certainly not very inspiring stuff, but it can make a whale of a difference in your client's well-being -- even if they and their family never fully appreciate the true value of such advice.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®", Feature,Sep,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Clients , Decision making , Taxpayers , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Multivariate analyses show that while there are generally not racial/ethnic differences in preferences for type of financial service professionals, Black households are significantly different in their use of financial planners; they are significantly more likely to use financial planners compared to all other racial/ethnic groups when controlling for other household characteristics. Results indicate that the popular assets under management fee structure may inadvertently be preventing Black and Hispanic households from using financial planners.

Enhancing Estate Planning with Investment Policy Statements,"Financial planners can enhance their clients estate planning by using an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) to manage client assets. Most importantly, you can create an IPS to set clear expectations with clients and all parties in regard to the philosophies, policies, investment objectives, and risk parameters that will guide the investment of the client's liquid wealth. Trustees of irrevocable trusts must follow the Uniform Prudent Investor Act tenets, stating trustees are required to pursue an investment strategy that accounts for factors such as risk and return. The IPS develops a systematic investment discipline for the trustee and investment adviser to follow and can discourage the trustee or fiduciary from making emotional decisions as a result of turbulent market conditions. Note that the IPS establishes management procedures for specifically addressing prohibited investments and transactions.

Financial Advisers Can't Overlook the Prudent Investor Rule,"To protect the integrity of financial advice to retirement savers, in April the Department of Labor (DOL) promulgated a rule that imposes fiduciary status under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) on any person who provides investment advice or recommendations to an IRA owner or to a retirement plan beneficiary. The DOL's main rationale for expanding the scope of ERISA fiduciary status was to impose the fiduciary duty of loyalty on financial advisers to retirement savers, obligating those advisers to give financial advice that is unaffected by the personal financial interests of the adviser. The purpose of this article is to highlight the DOL's imposition of the trust law duty of care, and so the prudent investor rule, on financial advisers to retirement savers. In brief, the prudent investor rule codifies the essence of modern portfolio theory. The core teaching of portfolio theory is that an investor should maintain a well-diversified portfolio with a level of risk and return matched to her particular circumstances.","Schanzenbach, Max M, PhD, JD;Sitkoff, Robert H, JD", Feature,Aug,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Duty of care , ERISA , Fiduciary responsibility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
What Impact Could the DOL Rule Have on the Mutual Fund Industry?,"Although much of the news following the announcement of the Department of Labor's Conflict of Interest Final Rule has focused on the adviser component of the equation, another component that deserves discussion is the impact the fiduciary rule may have on financial product providers. Although the fiduciary rule does allow advisers to receive commission-based compensation and/or indirect income by way of revenue-sharing provisions allowed through certain mutual fund share classes, there's some question as to how long that will be the case. Direct compensation seems to be the direction the industry is headed, and indirect forms of compensation could be challenged in the future. The most common form of indirect compensation is through mutual funds, the 12b-1 fee, which was created through the auspices of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The 12b-1 application provided a way for mutual fund companies to compensate a third party for performing tangible service functions that they otherwise would be delivering themselves.","Coté, Thomas P", Cover Story,Aug,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Compensation , Commissions , Conflicts of interest , Fiduciary responsibility , Revenue sharing , Scandals , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Intertemporal Persistence of Risk Tolerance Scores,"Before moving forward, it is important to clearly define what is meant by the term financial risk tolerance. The International Organization for Standardization (2006) concluded that financial risk tolerance is the extent to which someone is willing to experience a less favorable outcome in the pursuit of an outcome with more favorable attributes. The key word in the definition is willingness, which is someone's degree of readiness to engage in behavior. Whether a person's willingness to engage in a risky behavior is a relatively fixed dimension of personality or a transient emotional disposition is a question that has been widely debated in the financial planning literature. Some have argued that people have a natural tendency to perceive situations in a certain way that influences their willingness to take risks. As previously noted, the stability and persistence of financial risk tolerance scores across time continues to be debated within the financial planning profession.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP®;Heo, Wookjae, PhD;Kruger, Michelle", Feature,Aug,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Standardization , Behavior , Risk , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Path Toward a True Profession,"The Department of Labor's (DOL) fiduciary rule is elegant in its core provisions, yet fraught with danger for those who ignore its tough requirements when providing conflicted advice. Should the fiduciary rule survive judicial and political challenges, it promises to propel the financial planning community closer to status as a true profession with its foundation firmly rooted in the provision of objective advice and counsel. Various class exemptions then seek to accommodate a variety of ways broker-dealers, insurance companies, and their representatives receive compensation from product manufacturers, primarily through the Best Interest Contract Exemption, or BICE, in which the ""best interests"" fiduciary standard is applied.

New Approaches to Retirement Income: An Evaluation of Combination Laddered Strategies,"The use of life annuities for retirement account assets by participants in qualified plans and holders of deductible and rollover individual retirement accounts (IRA) is of great interest to analysts, policymakers, and advisers. With the decline in automatic annuitization from defined benefit pension plans, many are concerned about the financial security of retirees -- that retirees receive continual income payments over increasingly longer lifetimes. Experts recognize, however, that voluntary full and total annuitization may be an unrealistic and even inappropriate goal for most retired households. Therefore, partial annuitization strategies need to be fully explored. This paper builds on prior, related research to show the advantage of a broad genus of partial annuitization combination strategies using systematic withdrawals from a dynamically changing investment portfolio together with the laddered purchases of immediate life annuities over an extended period of time.

Digital Attrition: What It Means for Your Practice,"The author believes the impact of technology is tremendous for everyone. Technology is at the point where they may underappreciate how much it has improved many aspects of their lives, from banking to ordering food to health care. In their profession specifically, technology is improving the client-adviser relationship. This is most certainly happening in banking, retail shopping, and countless other industries. Herein lies the genesis of digital attrition. Digital attrition is a term used by people way smarter than the author. In short, it describes users who leave companies or services that do not offer an ideal digital experience. This same digital expectation is coming to the financial planning profession. You could argue that they are experiencing it now; however, the real tsunami of change is still coming. Finally, offering a digital experience will make your practice more appealing to a wider pool of prospects, resulting in a larger book of business, more referrals, and, ultimately, more revenue.","Stich, Anthony", Feature,Aug,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Technology adoption , Impact analysis , Banking industry , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Forward with Fiduciary,"The financial services profession is no stranger to regulation. In the wake of the Great Depression that devastated the financial wherewithal of individuals in the US, Congress created laws to protect the financial security of its citizens. The Securities Act of 1933 was the first major federal legislation to regulate the offer and sale of securities. This was followed by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Similar to the initial passing of ERISA, a confluence of financial challenges and court decisions caused the DOL in October 2010 to propose amendments to the 1975 regulations. The DOL had concerns that conflicts of interest may compromise advice given to retirement plans and IRA investors. There can be no doubt that FPA and the profession will face policy issues similar to the DOL fiduciary rule in the future. What you have learned is that honest, direct, and respectful discussion can go a long way to support the mission of FPA, your members, and the profession.","Gjertsen, Edward W, II, CFP®", Feature,Aug,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Regulation , Amendments , Investment advisors , Financial services , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Why the Fiduciary Standard Exists,"The more personally invested you are in a relationship, the more you are likely to trust them. The more you trust someone, the more you can be hurt by them -- emotionally, physically, financially, etc. The most egregious breaches of trust by family members generally stand alone in their emotional impact. But the depth and breadth of damage that can be inflicted from betrayals by professional advisers can be even more devastating. In Roman times, the fiduciary standard began to crystalize and take a form easily recognized in today's standard. The term ""fiduciary"" originated in Roman law and means a person holding the character of a trustee, or a character analogous to a trustee, in respect to the trust and confidence involved in it and the scrupulous good faith and candor it requires. Perversely, financial advisers have the least consistent and rigorous system of holding practitioners accountable as fiduciaries.","Aikin, Blaine F, CFP®, CFA, AIFA®", Feature,Aug,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Trust , Accountability , Fiduciary responsibility , Fiduciaries , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Modern Investing Trends Reframe Active vs. Passive Debate,"Current trends in asset management and within the ETF space indicate that the active versus passive management debate may soon become outdated. New strains of investment products seek to combine the attributes of active and passive management so that investors benefit from active management in the more flexible, transparent, and cost-efficient manner associated with passive management. Advisers can demonstrate their value by explaining how certain products attempt to combine the best characteristics of active and passive management, and working with clients to determine whether or not the products in question are worth their fees given performance history, potential for alpha generation, correlations to other asset classes, and client goals and time horizons. The rise of smart beta ETFs is one of many trends spurred by the financial crisis of 2008, when investors saw firsthand that traditional asset allocation strategies and investment approaches could not adequately protect them in extreme market conditions.","Clift, Tim", Feature,Aug,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment products , Financial planners , Exchange traded funds , Asset management , Trends , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Which Financial Advice Topics Are Positively Associated with Financial Satisfaction?,"Financial satisfaction is an indicator of consumer financial well-being that is an important component of overall life satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between financial advice topics and financial satisfaction. This study used data from the 2012 National Financial Capability Study, which asked more than 25,000 respondents nationwide whether they received financial advice from any financial service professional in the last five years. Results of t-tests showed that respondents who received financial advice on all financial topics except debt counseling, compared to those who did not receive advice, scored higher on financial satisfaction. Multiple regression analysis findings indicated that, controlling for several demographic and financial variables, advice on investments and taxes was positively associated with financial satisfaction.

With yield-generating ETFs in the limelight, investors may wish to focus on high-quality dividend growers that offer sustainable payouts. Dividends are often seen as a reflection of confidence in a company's balance sheet, earnings, and performance outlook. Dividend-paying companies that have consistently increased dividends are ranked among an elite group of dividend payers and have outperformed those that eschewed cash payouts.

Planning for the Net Investment Income Tax for Non-Grantor Trusts,"The net investment income tax (NIIT) under section 1411 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted under the 2010 health care legislation in order to fund health care reform. It became effective starting in tax year 2013. The NIIT is a 3.8% tax imposed on net investment income. The amount of net investment income subject to the tax is the lesser of: net investment income; or adjusted gross income (with some adjustments) in excess of a threshold amount. The NIIT applies to trusts and estates as well as to individuals. And with thresholds for applicability much lower for estates and trusts than for individuals, trusts are operating at a clear disadvantage. The NIIT affects both simple and complex trusts. Simple trusts are required to make income distributions to beneficiaries, whereas complex trusts can generally make discretionary distributions of income and sometimes principal, or they can accumulate income, adding it to corpus.","Welch, Julie A, CPA, PFP, CFP®;Smith, Cara, CPA, CFP®", Feature,Jul,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment income , Financial planning , Income taxes , Internal Revenue Code , Trusts , Health care policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Fear of Fees in Defined Contribution Plans,"Fees are a major theme when investment offerings, such as target date funds (TDF), are being vetted for defined contribution plans. Discussions are often anchored there, once fees come into play, and the subsequent bargaining may overshadow other important considerations. Among its tips for ERISA plan fiduciaries, the US Department of Labor suggests costs as the fourth factor to review, after understanding the fund's investments. For plan sponsors, however, fee consideration is often singled out as the most critical step to improve their fiduciary positioning. The fear may well have been heightened by the recent ""excessive-fee"" suits, including the Supreme Court's ruling in Tibble v. Edison International. Individual investment experiences vary, but this ordering of attributions held for the majority of cases, across various savings patterns, glide paths in TDFs, and levels of fees observable in the market. This analysis revealed that such security hinges on savings levels and investment outcomes, plus a containment of the effect of management fees.","Pang, Gaobo, PhD, CFA", Feature,Jul,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Lifecycle funds , ERISA , Stock offerings , Fiduciaries , Defined contribution plans , Supreme Court decisions , Fees & charges , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Capital Market Expectations and Monte Carlo Simulations,"One of the important and challenging aspects of retirement income planning relates to how taking distributions from an investment portfolio amplifies the impacts of portfolio volatility. Monte Carlo simulations can be used to show how the range of money-weighted investment returns gets larger in retirement. This has important implications about the choice for a fixed portfolio return assumption that should be used when creating financial plans within a spreadsheet. For a lifetime financial plan, the most intuitive way to express a portfolio return assumption is as an inflation-adjusted compounding return. Unfortunately, this is generally not the most common way returns are expressed. It is worth a quick review of the steps needed to arrive at a real compounded return. As for retirement, the impacts are even bigger, as sequence risk further amplifies the impact of investment volatility. Retirees experience heightened sequence-of-returns risk when funding a constant spending stream from a volatile portfolio, because portfolio declines imply needing to spend a greater percentage of remaining assets.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Jul,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Monte Carlo simulation , Financial planning , Retirement planning , Rates of return , Volatility , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
From Irrational to Rational: 6 steps to guide clients to productive decisions,"In modern society, money is the primary tool for survival, security, and satisfaction. Consequently, every primitive survival and pleasure-seeking drive is intensely focused on capturing and guarding money.

Here are 6 steps to guide clients to productive decisions: 1. Predict irrationality. 2. Listen for emotions. 3. Acknowledge and normalize. 4. Repeat the big picture. 5. Use vivid fluency. 6.

O'Leary said one of his investing rules is to never own a stock that doesn't pay a dividend. Because he learned through experiences in his life that really profoundly changed the way he invests. His mother used to tell him and his brother to never spend the principal, only the interest. She's not a portfolio manager, but she had that philosophy of getting paid something. It turns out that dividends are the backbone of returns. And so, from that experience, he's just made it a personal philosophy. Diversification is the key when investing.

Nurturing: One Way to Succeed at Succession,"Succession planning is an often-talked and written about topic for good reason. The baby boomer cohort is moving through the financial planning profession just as it is society as a whole. In contemplating practice succession, as with the financial planning process, it's important to establish and even prioritize competing objectives. Fundamentally, there are only two types of exit strategies: an insider transition and an outsider transition (with variations including mergers and roll-ups). Most advisers would prefer to transition their practice to someone with whom they and their clients are already familiar. Further, they prefer that the prospective successor reflect their values, philosophy, and approach. In short, they want to nurture their own successor.

Understanding Tax Implications of Foreign Stocks,"Financial planners have a more difficult job in portfolio construction than non-client-facing money management professionals for many reasons. The most obvious one is that clients have a tendency to let their emotions affect their decisions. But intricate technical issues, such as tax management, especially around foreign investments, can challenge financial planners in particular. Most foreign governments require US brokerage firms to withhold tax on dividends that companies based in their countries pay to US citizens. Through tax treaties, however, individual investors can usually get the tax back if the asset is held in a taxable account -- but not if the asset is held in a nontaxable account, like an IRA or a qualified plan. Most countries tax dividends that their companies pay to foreign investors. This may cause US investors with foreign-based holdings to be taxed twice -- once by the foreign country, and once by the US.","Burke, John, CFP", Feature,Jun,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , International , Foreign investment , Tax treaties , Portfolio management , Investments",ProQuest One Academic
Talking with Clients about Same-Sex Couple Retirement Withdrawal Rates,"Legalization of same-sex marriage by the US Supreme Court on Jun 26, 2015 made it easier for same-sex couples to jointly manage retirement assets. Traditional research has focused on heterosexual couple retirement withdrawal rates. Same-sex couples naturally will ask if they can use the standard recommendations for retirement withdrawal rates, or if they need to adjust those rates to reflect the makeup of their family. This study explored systematic differences between heterosexual and same-sex couple withdrawal rates so that same-sex couples can adjust publicly available retirement withdrawal rate projections for their specific circumstances. Likewise, financial planners can use this analysis to help advise clients. Sustainable retirement withdrawal rates for same-sex couples vary in a systematic manner from withdrawal rates for heterosexual couples. However, because of life expectancy convergence at typical retirement ages, the differences are slight, and same-sex couples can reliably use withdrawal rates recommended for heterosexual couples with, at most, slight adjustments.","Mitchell, John B, DBA;Felton, Zachary S;Mitchell, G Thomas", Feature,Jun,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Same sex marriage , Financial planning , Withdrawals , Retirement plans , Advantages , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

One obvious item that should be on the checklist of everyone approaching age 65 is to sign up for Medicare to avoid the possibility of a lapse in insurance coverage or a permanent increase in premiums for Part B coverage. From the financial adviser's standpoint, those who have clients approaching age 65 must be conscious of the sign-up rules to provide proper service to clients and to retain them. Medicare provides government-sponsored health insurance for those age 65 and older, and for those who are on Social Security disability.

Applying Behavioral Finance to Ourselves,"The field of financial planning is complex, and practitioners intellectually understand that they should be offering their clients holistic advice grounded in theory. Even when beliefs and actions may be very different among financial planning practices, many planners try to stay within the guidelines of theories they follow. Problems arise when market behavior and current events strain the theories and the nerves of the planner. It's easy to forget that practitioners are subject to the same emotional stress as their clients. In meetings, they remind their clients of the importance of ""staying the course,"" but in practice, they may have trouble doing it themselves. A financial planner who is faced with a stressful situation can more easily engage a proven theory base by simply slowing down, avoiding the first behavior that springs to mind, and letting system two make a logical judgment.","Doviak, Peggy, PhD, CFP", Feature,Jun,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Personality traits , Polls & surveys , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Dick Wagner on Why Financial Planning Is the Most Important Profession of the Century,"In an interview, Richard Wagner, author, speaker, thought leader, and financial futurist, talked about why financial planning is the ,most important profession of the century. For planners, Wagner thinks there are actually two key points. One is that money is the most powerful and pervasive secular force on the planet, which speaks to huge responsibility. Economic prosperity was a big deal, but it was not based on money the same way as it is today, where money is really the only source of, at some level, determining well-being and wealth. The whole concept of ""what is wealth"" is one that needs to be addressed as well. The mission and purpose of financial planning is to work with individuals. and families and their personal relationships with money and the fearsome forces that it generates. The Department of Labor fiduciary standard is about holding somebody's best interest to heart. He finds words like ""best interest"" to be pretty ambiguous, so he'd rather use ""trust"" and ""confidence.""","Yeske, Dave, DBAC, CFP®", Interview,May,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Personal relationships , Professions , United States--US , Wagner, Richard",ProQuest One Academic
How Robo Technology Is Changing Wealth Management,"Over the past year, there has been a lot of talk about robo-advisers as financial advisers try to determine how to best use this technology. But before you dive in, consider your business, the environment today, and most importantly -- where this technology is headed. When it comes to new technology, there is always a mad rush and few winners remain. Robos are no different. As a matter a fact, the concept of robos is nothing new. Today's robo-adviser is simply the same wealth management engine that professional advisers have used with a highly simplified interface, but with very limited investment solutions. Understanding how today's robos may impact the broader wealth management business may help maintain consistent revenue. As various robo platforms are trying to find a place in the market, some are starting to sell their technology as a solution. However, remember that the individual financial adviser or firm would be responsible for managing risk and investments.","Bhatnagar, Ash, CFP®", Commentary,May,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Technology adoption , Automation , Risk management , Wealth management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Risks of De-Risking,"De-risking usually takes the form of reducing a portfolio's allocation to equities below the level that would be typical of the investor's financial situation. There are certain risks associated with this tactic, some long known, and some new and unique to today's market conditions. To begin with, de-risking may take the equity allocation below a level that would be considered prudent for a given investor's long-term financial well-being. Cash is the probably the single-worst asset class one could choose if the goal is to protect the economic value (the purchasing power) of the portfolio. De-risking into cash can be self-destructive and therefore a risk not worth taking. The best way to de-risk the portfolio in the current environment is to not decrease the equity allocation at all, but to replace a material portion of traditional equities with their risk-managed counterparts.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFP®, CFA, FCAS, MAAA, CERA;Chow, Gladys, CIMA®", Commentary,May,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk management , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs: Employer Plans or IRAs?,"Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) and Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRAs flip-flop between operating rules for IRAs and employer plan rules. If you're an adviser dealing with business owners, knowing the subtle difference is extremely important. Certain aspects of the plans are often misunderstood -- like the 25% tax penalty if you make a withdrawal within two years from when you first participated in the SIMPLE IRA plan, or the ""still working exception"" associated with employer plans. Contribution limits and allowable contributions differ dramatically between traditional and Roth IRAs, SEPs, and SIMPLE IRAs. SIMPLE IRAs and SEP IRAs follow the same required minimum distribution rules as traditional IRAs. While there's a ""still working"" exception for a 401(k) and other employer plans, this is one area where SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs do not follow plan rules, but rather IRA rules.","Harris, Bill, CFP®", Commentary,May,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Differences , Financial planners , SEP , SIMPLE retirement plans , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Advantages , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Why David Blanchett's Retirement Spending Research Is a Big Deal,"In recent years, David Blanchett of Morningstar has unveiled research confirming what Michael Stein in his 1998 book (The Prosperous Retirement: Guide to the New Reality) and Ty Bernicke in his June 2005 Journal article (""Reality Retirement Planning: A New Paradigm for an Old Science"") demonstrated years ago: namely that real (inflation-adjusted) retirement spending decreases over time until, for some, health care costs cause it to rise again late in life. Blanchett's work rises from ""nice-to-know"" to ""big deal"" status because most empirically based safe withdrawal strategies take a static approach to spending which assumes that retirees need to increase their spending by inflation in each and every year of retirement. In reality, they don't. Blanchett's research into actual retiree spending patterns, coupled with the research around dynamic retirement distribution strategies and spending policies, means that retirees can enjoy sustainable retirement lifestyles with higher incomes and/or lower asset totals and/or earlier retirement dates than the plethora of static-approach withdrawal research would otherwise have them believe.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®", Commentary,May,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Research , Health care expenditures , Inflation , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Taxation of Social Security Benefits and Planning Implications,"The taxability of social security benefits (SSB) for federal income tax purposes phases in as income increases. None of the benefits are taxable at low levels of income, but up to 85% of the SSBs are taxable at higher levels of income. At intermediate levels of income, where the SSBs' taxability is phasing in but has not reached the maximum 85%, additional income causes additional SSBs to be taxable, a phenomenon that has been dubbed the ""tax torpedo"". This paper analyzed the joint effect of these two factors. It shows that the additional SSBs that are taxable because of an additional dollar of income generates an additional tax that ranges from zero to 21.25 cents. The portion of SSBs that are taxable depends in part on an amount referred to as provisional income (PI). PI equals modified adjusted gross income plus one-half of the SSBs received.","Geisler, Greg, PhD;Hulse, David S, PhD", Feature,May,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Taxation , Gross income , Social security , Tax exempt , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
A New Approach: How to talk to clients about long-term care to compel them to act,"There is arguably no other unexpected event in life that creates more lasting damages to a family than the need for long-term care later in life. Yet few financial advisers understand the serious emotional, physical, and financial consequences of providing for a family member who is so frail, so fragile that he or she is no longer safe. This article gives the financial professional insight into the often irreversible consequences of providing and paying for care. The article has two goals: to give compelling reasons why you should proactively engage your client on the subject; and to suggest an innovative approach to discussing those consequences in a manner that compels the individual to take action. That action is not to purchase a product to mitigate the risk to the client, but rather to allow you to create a plan to protect the client's family -- those whom the client invited into his or her life and promised to take care of.","Gordon, Harley, JD, CLTC", Cover Story,May,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Long term health care , Financial planning , Client relationships , Long term care insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Wealth, retirement, and estate decisions have never been as complicated, nor has there ever been as much opportunity to develop approaches and financial plans that can echo into the future. Those echoes, however, will reverberate with planning genius, or with the shrill tones of shortsightedness.

Financial Catastrophes Due to Disability: Which Households Are Most at Risk?,"According to an actuarial note from the Social Security Administration, the risk of becoming disabled is substantially greater than the risk of dying prematurely. The Social Security Administration considers an individual to be disabled if he or she is unable ""to engage in substantial gainful activity"" due to an injury or illness that is expected to result in death or to last one year or more, according to its 2015 Red Book. Disability can be a financially catastrophic event for households. According to the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, the median income for US households was $46,700. Disability risk exposures can be managed by retaining the risk, transferring the risk, and, to some extent, reducing the risk. Retaining the risk through self-insurance may seem like a reasonable strategy to manage the risk of becoming disabled; however, research has shown that this is typically not realistic.","Heckman, Stuart J, PhD, CFP®", Feature,May,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Households , Polls & surveys , Disability , Demographics , Risk management , Social security , Self insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

3 Ways to Help Your Clients Make Smart College Choices,"For all the talk about outrageous tuition costs and zillionaire dropouts, a college education is still one of the best investments most people could make.

That is simply an average. But as with just about any other investment, results aren't guaranteed. Here's how you can use the Money College Planner tool and other resources to help your clients make smart college choices: 1. educational quality, 2, affordability, and 3. graduate outcomes. In the end, financial issues should be just one part of a family's college selection decision.

The Financial Planner's A.I.D.E.

Incorporating Home Equity into a Retirement Income Strategy,"The use of a reverse mortgage to supplement portfolio withdrawals as a part of retirement income strategy is a fascinating topic and a number of counterintuitive findings are slowly entering into the financial planning profession. For most Americans, home equity and Social Security benefits represent the two biggest assets on the household balance sheet, frequently dwarfing the available amount of financial assets. Even for wealthier clients, home equity is still a significant asset that should not automatically be lumped into a limiting category of last-resort options once all else has failed. Past studies generally struggled with how to explain the combined impacts of home equity use on sustaining a retirement spending goal as well as preserving assets for legacy. When describing the impacts on legacy, past studies generally focused on the median amount of legacy wealth and struggled with how to make proper comparisons in cases when the full spending goal was not met.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Apr,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Home equity loans , Impact analysis , Financial planning , Retirement plans , Reverse mortgages , Social security , Equity , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Improving Withdrawal Rates in a Low-Yield World,"Determining an appropriate withdrawal rate from their investment portfolios is one of the biggest investment or financial planning decisions retirees will make. Prior research indicates that a portfolio of 50% stocks and 50% bonds is capable of supporting an initial withdrawal rate of 4% (with the dollar amount subsequently adjusted for inflation). Bengen (1994) showed that a 4% initial withdrawal rate failed in 0% of historical simulations. In addition, using Monte Carlo simulations, with capital market expectations equal to the historical averages, the 4% initial withdrawal rate failed in only 6% of the simulations. One way to increase the safe withdrawal rate of a portfolio is to decrease the allocation to bonds and increase the allocation to stocks. Unfortunately, increasing the allocation to stocks dramatically changes the risk profile of the portfolio by increasing the standard deviation of returns and increasing the maximum drawdown.","Miller, Andrew, CFA, CFP®", Feature,Apr,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Monte Carlo simulation , Stocks , Withdrawals , Retirees , Simulation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Propensity to Plan: A Key to Health and Wealth?,"This article describes a study of the relationship of a self-reported planning behavior and the frequency of performance of positive health and financial management practices. The study uses data from an online survey of personal health and financial practices to examine whether respondents who have higher health behavior scores also have higher financial behavior scores. The conceptual base of this study is the Theory of Planned Behavior, which links intentions to perform behaviors with attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. This theory has been found to be well supported by empirical evidence as a highly accurate reliable way to predict human behavior. Correlation analysis was conducted between the health and financial behavior indexes. The correlation was 0.46 at a significance level of p &lt; .05. This result suggests that desirable health and financial behaviors are moderately associated. Support was found for all three hypotheses in this study.

Understanding the Line of Credit Growth for a Reverse Mortgage,"Although reverse mortgages have long had a bad reputation with financial planners and the public, new government rules and research articles from the past few years are causing many to take a second look at their potential role and value. Research published in the Journal starting with the Barry Sacks and Stephen Sacks article, ""Reversing the Conventional Wisdom: Using Home Equity to Supplement Retirement Income,"" from the February 2012 issue, reaches an important conclusion that there is potentially great value in beginning a reverse mortgage as soon as eligible (age 62) for those with a reasonable expectation to remain in their homes. The idea is to begin the reverse mortgage early, even if proceeds from it may not be taken out for many years. The reason for these conclusions relates to how the line of credit on a reverse mortgage grows throughout retirement. Understanding this detail is probably one of the most challenging aspects when first learning about reverse mortgages as a retirement income planning tool.

This is a new view of financial markets that really looks at the economic interactions through the lens of evolutionary biology to try to understand how it could be that markets can be so important and work so well at times and fail them so badly at other times. The idea behind a managed futures strategy is that you're going to be following trends. So if the price of oil goes down, then you tend to sell it. If the price of cocoa goes up, then you tend to buy it as a trend follower.

Investment Bargains in Corporate Bond Markets?,"Many upper-income investors buy individual corporate and municipal bonds rather than bond funds or ETFs. Post-2008, the bond markets have become more transparent, but much less liquid. This has created a transparent but strangely fragmented market that resembles that for consumer products. Bargains abound, sometimes in small quantities, bonds go ""on sale,"" and close substitutes trade at different prices. The analysis in this paper shows that bargains truly exist. The yield-to-maturity pickups and price discounts in markets for the same corporate bonds were measured, and some causes explored. The analysis shows that, at any given time, an investor could be paying up to 5% more or 5% less than the fair value of the bond. The analysis also shows that the deals tend to be in premium bonds and in discontinued corporate names.","Dubil, Robert, PhD", Feature,Mar,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Discounts , Studies , Municipal bonds , Investment policy , Bond markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Expense-Performance Relationship (or Lack Thereof),"In this month's column, the author points out an econometric problem with the majority of the empirical studies that have documented a negative expense-performance relationship and what this means for financial planners when selecting mutual funds for clients. If the negative relationship between mutual fund expenses and performance was linear, as most of the empirical literature assumes, then financial planners should correctly believe that the cheapest funds perform the best, and therefore, they are the ones that would be most prudent to select for their clients. However, as Barber, Odean, and Zheng's analysis shows, the relationship is not linear. Therefore, what can be said about the role of expense ratios in the mutual fund selection process isn't that financial planners should seek funds with the lowest expense ratios, rather that they should avoid funds with the highest expense ratios. Barber, Odean, and Zheng conducted their analysis of the expense-performance relationship over the time period 1970 to 1999. The financial dynamics of the mutual fund industry have changed since then.","Nanigian, David, PhD", Feature,Mar,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Mutual funds , Portfolio performance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Social Media First Steps,"FPA and LinkedIn recently conducted a study that found 67% of high-growth firms leveraged multiple social media platforms to connect with and educate current and potential clients. Maybe that's because the highest net worth individuals are on social media and are using it to do research on investments and information relevant to their current financial situations. A separate LinkedIn study, conducted with Cogent Research, found that 52% of affluent investors indicated they'd be interested in interacting with financial planners through social media, yet only 4% of them are actually engaged by planners online. Some first steps for successfully using social media at your firm are: 1. Educate yourself on your company's social media policy. 2. Try LinkedIn first. 3. Go for quality over quantity. 4.

When Helping Hurts: 5 recommendations for planners with financial-enabling clients,"Financially dependent adult children who continue to rely on their parents well into their 30s, 40s, and 50s, can be a significant threat to the financial health of financial planning clients. Although a referral for financial therapy may be advised, it is common for a financial planner to be the only professional in a position to identify and influence a financial enabling-dependence dynamic. Here are five considerations for financial planners who are dealing with financial enabling and financial dependence: 1. Recognize that financial help can hurt. 2. Understand the curse of too many options. 3. Acknowledge the curse of unstructured free time. 4. Rip off the financial band-aid. 5.

Altering Irrevocable Trusts: Bringing flexibility to the inflexible,"An irrevocable trust established during life or at death as part of an estate plan represents a primary vehicle used to transfer and manage assets to meet the objectives and dispositive goals of the grantor and the beneficiaries -- at the time the trust is created. However, goals and objectives can change quickly with the changing circumstances of the grantor and the beneficiaries. And irrevocable trusts, by their very nature, do not change -- at least that's what they tend to think. As financial planners, they set plans in motion based on client-communicated wishes and their understanding of what the future may hold. Contrary to popular belief, when life's circumstances change, there are ways to change the impacted irrevocable trust: 1. private settlement agreement, 2. decanting, and 3. reformation. The methods for altering irrevocable trusts vary by state-specific law, which is frequently influenced by the Uniform Trust Code.","Chuna, Trevor R, CFP®, AEP®, CTFA", Feature,Mar,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Irrevocable trusts , Estate planning , Trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Spending in Retirement: Determining the Consumption Gap,"Much of the financial planning literature on safe withdrawal rates assumes that retirees spend a constant amount of money that is based on spending down (or decumulating) a percentage of accumulated investment assets. However, retirees seem to spend much less than theory would predict. Rather than spending down savings during retirement, many studies have found that the value of retirees' financial assets hold steady or even increase over time. This unwillingness to spend from assets can result in a gap between the amount retirees could safely spend and their actual spending during retirement. This study compared retirees' actual consumption to that available under multiple asset allocation strategies. A retirement consumption gap (RCG) exists where actual spending is less than available spending. By considering multiple asset allocation strategies, it analyzed what the RCG would be for retirees with varying preferences for market risk and income certainty. Results suggest that a consumption gap exists across all asset allocation strategies for those with financial assets at the median level and above.","Browning, Chris, PhD;Guo, Tao, PhD;Cheng, Yuanshan;Finke, Michael S, PhD, CFP®", Feature,Feb,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Asset allocation , Retirees , Retirement planning , Consumption , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"""SOAP"" Notes for Advisers?","Communicating action items as quickly as possible after client review meetings allows advisers to get things off their minds before moving on to the next task, while staff prepares to follow up on action items. Often, though, there's a delay between the time that a client leaves a review meeting and when the notes -- whether in verbal or written form -- are conveyed. One reason may be that the adviser doesn't have a consistent, efficient approach for summarizing the meeting. Several decades ago, medical professionals started using ""SOAP"" notes. SOAP stands for subjective, objective, assessment, and plan. The notes are consistent, clear, and concise, and they quickly communicate to staff what needs to be done next.

When Life Insurance Is too Good to Be True,"Tax planning often involves the use of creative structures that appear to comply with the tax laws while allowing a client the ability to achieve a desired outcome that the IRS and Congress may not like. Creativity in tax planning can, however, push the envelope too far, creating results that, while ostensibly in compliance with the tax rules, are too good to be true. Due to the tax benefits associated with the use of life insurance, life insurance is often used as a key component in tax planning. One example is the use of life insurance in a Section 419 plan. Section 419 plans appear to permit business owners to purchase life insurance on an income-tax deductible basis through an employee welfare benefit plan, and still retain tax-free access to cash values through policy loans and receipt of the death benefit free of income taxes.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP®, CFA, CLU®;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP®, CFA", Commentary,Feb,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Tax free , Tax planning , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Estate Planning Implications of Remarriage: Understand spousal rights, then learn how to reduce or eliminate them","Most people getting remarried have little to no concept of the full legal impact of their new marriage. Many believe that documents like prenuptials or other waivers are only needed by the wealthy. As a result, they often do little planning when a remarriage occurs -- increasing the conflict and chaos that often occurs when people die. Financial planners should make sure their clients understand the practical, legal, and tax impacts of an impending remarriage or recent remarriage. Because of all of the state variations, this area of law is even more complex than the federal tax code; 50 states have broadly different and constantly changing rules, exceptions, exclusions, and limitations. It also impacts far more families than state and federal estate taxes. But a central part of being a skilled planner is ensuring clients and their parents and close family members fully understand the practical, legal, and tax impacts of an impending remarriage or recent remarriage.","Scroggin, John J, AEP®, JD, LLM", Feature,Feb,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Remarriage , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Bridging Theory and Practice,"Financial planning is a relatively young profession. The relatively recent addition of college degrees in the field of financial planning has led to research written specifically for financial planners. The future of financial planning is, indeed, bright. However, there has been a long-standing division between those who conduct research in the field and practitioners. As the field moved more to a client-planner relationship, determining the scope of what you currently call ""financial planning"" was challenging. Best practices often came about through formalizing processes because they worked -- not because they were grounded in theory. And too many times, the theoretical world of financial planning, housed primarily in universities, has little impact on the practices of planners.

The Impact of the 2008-2009 Stock Market Crash on the Wealth of U.S. Households,"The Great Recession began in December 2007 and officially ended in June 2009, although high unemployment, substantial drops in housing prices, and high foreclosure rates continued for years after 2009. The impact on the stock market was also severe. For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a peak before the Great Recession of 14,088 on Oct 1, 2007 and decreased to 6,547 by Mar 9, 2009, a decrease of 54%.

Less Is More: Clearing out the Business Clutter,"Over several years coaching financial advisers, the author found that most find themselves with more than just physical clutter such as client notes and old newsletters. He believes there are four types of clutter. Physical clutter is probably the easiest to detect because it is physically present. Most financial advisers have some degree of physical clutter, but if it has taken over more than half of your work area, then it has grown out of control. Emotional clutter is much more difficult to manage because there is no visual component. It can be a task to consistently figure out where something should go, and that is why many advisers find themselves taking the path of least resistance and just forming piles with the intention of filing items later. Product clutter is the most socially accepted form of clutter. Some advisers even consider it a badge of honor to have hundreds of stock positions, numerous mutual fund families, annuities, and money managers to follow.","Finley, Daniel C", Feature,Jan,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Work environment , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

From Founder to Successor 8 areas to consider when planning for succession,"Most entrepreneurs dream of building a profitable business, enjoying autonomy and financial rewards, and cashing out untold wealth upon retirement. While researching the new book Success and Succession: Unlocking Value, Power, and Potential in the Professional Services and Advisory Space, the author and his co-author discovered several key items to address in order to ensure a smooth succession between business founders and successors. First, it's important to understand certain characteristics of founders and successors. When contemplating succession, each must understand the choices presented, maintain respect for one another, and cultivate a level of humility. Just like advisers analyze client assets and liabilities, they should also examine their own businesses ahead of succession. In a perfect transition, both founder and successor avoid extremes and adopt a collaborative approach based on empathy -- an understanding of the personalities that each embodies and appreciation for what each contributes.","Hummel, Jay", Feature,Jan,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Financial planners , Succession planning , Successors , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Quantifying the Value of Downside Protection,"In the wake of the financial crisis and ensuing equity market collapse of 2008-2009, there has been a proliferation of strategies and products that attempt to dampen the volatility -- and in some cases explicitly limit the downside risk -- of equities. Each of these approaches has a cost, whether implicit or explicit, and some strategies are more cost efficient than others. A possible solution to the portfolio problem is provided by investments that attempt to manage equity risk directly within the equity investment itself. The authors label such attempts as ""risk-managed investing"" (RMI). This article outlines the various categories of products and solutions currently available, covering both volatility dampening and downside protection elements of RMI. it is important to note that RMI's ability to elevate the efficient frontier is to be expected.

Could a Health Savings Account Be Better than an Employer-Matched 401(k)?,"Health savings accounts (HSA), which require that an individual be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) to be set up, are quickly becoming very common. O'Brien (2015) reports that at the end of 2014, assets in all HSAs, both those provided by employers and those that are not, totaled $24.2 billion in almost 13 million accounts. Because they are taxed like a retirement account, HSAs should be compared to retirement accounts. Financial planners should always find out if their clients are eligible to set up an HSA and, if they are, make appropriate recommendations about funding and taking distributions from it. This article does not analyze whether an employee should choose a HDHP or a traditional health plan, if their employer offers both. Instead, this article provides financial planners with the tools needed to assess and perhaps recommend to individual clients HSAs as a wealth maximization option, where available. It also provides the tax-efficient rank ordering for contributing to HSAs, retirement accounts, 529 accounts, and for paying debts.","Geisler, Greg, PhD", Feature,Jan,2016,Journal of Financial Planning," Comparative analysis , Financial planning , Studies , Health savings accounts , Employers , Deferred compensation , Financial planners , Medical savings accounts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Case for Delaying Social Security,"On of the hottest topics in retirement income planning over the past several years has been how to help clients strategize on their Social Security claiming decisions. These discussions generally delve into the intricacies of approaches like ""file and suspend"" or ""file a restricted application."" The general theme emerging from these discussions is that at least the spouse with higher lifetime earnings should delay taking their benefit until age 70. The point is that greater emphasis should be placed on what happens in longer retirements, because the financial consequences are more severe, and this is when delaying Social Security will have a clear positive impact. The alternative to treating Social Security as insurance is to view it as an investment or as a gamble on how long one lives. This can be problematic. The investment approach focuses more on the break-even age for when it finally pays off to delay benefits.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Dec,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment , Advantages , Disadvantages , Income , Social security , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Innovative Uses of Variable Annuities for Legacy Planning,"Traditionally, variable annuities did not offer diverse and viable estate planning options. With older annuities, the insurance company typically kept whatever money was left in the contract when the client passed away. Now, however, you can have clients add riders to variable annuities that permit them to leave part of the annuity to their heirs, albeit sometimes in exchange for a lower regular payout. Seek the guidance of appropriate tax, legal, and other professional advisers when carefully assessing all income tax ramifications and legacy planning aspects of a variable annuity. Planning ahead with innovative strategies is essential to maximizing your clients' asset growth and wealth transfer. Think about a restricted beneficiary feature when your clients are concerned about transferring their variable annuity assets to spendthrift beneficiaries or heirs with limited financial experience or unique circumstances. Your clients can elect a full restriction or restrict only a portion of the assets for a specific beneficiary.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP, CTFA, AEP", Feature,Dec,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Beneficiaries , Estate planning , Variable annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

When the Old Horses Run,"You're undoubtedly aware of the aging adviser workforce. The average age of a CFP professional is 53. While clients no doubt benefit from the wisdom gained through their advancing years, the graying of the adviser workforce begs the question of what will become of their practices and the clients they serve. Some of you may have already undertaken to create a practice succession plan. Most of you have not. FPA will continue to provide great programming in practice management, including practice succession planning. And CFP Board will continue to develop registered programs, especially those in the leading schools of business. Working together, FPA and CFP Board can help ensure continuity of client service, support successful and profitable practice transition, and enhance career paths for a generation of new CFP professionals. That's a win-win for everyone, and it's an important step forward in the growth of your profession.","Rojeck, Richard P, CFP", Feature,Dec,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Transitions , Workforce planning , Older workers , Strategic planning , Succession planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Pamela Sandy on Building the FPA Brand and Creating Planners of Excellence,"In an interview, Pamela Sandy, CFP, ADPA, founder and CEO of boutique advisory firm Confiance LLC, and 2016 Financial Planning Association (FPA) president, talked about building the FPA brand and creating planners of excellence. FPA is very inclusive -- the diversity of their board represents that inclusivity. Initiatives in diversity, women in the profession, and their support of the next generation of planners all speak to FPA's vision of their changing world. FPA brings their history and the vision of the future together under one roof. Their growing collaboration with media and research partners, and their strengthening advocacy activities are raising awareness of FPA's value and that is essential in building the brand. Additionally, consumer recognition of FPA as the home of ""planners of excellence"" will connect the public with financial planning professionals that place the best interests of the client ahead of their own. Growing the FPA brand not only serves their members and the profession, but will increase consumer access to professional financial planners.","Schulaka, Carly", Interview,Dec,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Associations , Financial planners , Strategic management , Brand identification , United States--US , Sandy, Pamela",ProQuest One Academic
Succession: Why Aren't Planners Planning?,"Succession planning is important for you and your business. But there aren't many of you doing it. InvestmentNews reported earlier this year that the reasons are threefold with the first reason being valuation of the business. The second reason for not planning is planners simply are not ready for retirement. Planners plan for everybody but when it comes to succession -- and even retirement planning -- they haven't been doing it for themselves. The third reason is desire. Planners don't want to stop owning their business and doing what they're doing. They've seen their clients plan, only to die a few years into retirement and they're scared this might happen to them, so they just want to keep working.",Anonymous, Commentary,Dec,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Succession planning , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

He's sure that most of his colleagues in financial services haven't been that person either. But the system that fosters a lack of consumer care is still going strong and by many accounts getting stronger day by day. He teaches financial advisers to do things differently. He tells financial advisers their job is simple. Just model integrity and deliver freedom. That's it. Holding to those principles changes everything. Growth arises primarily from the entrepreneurial spirits of people. That spirit can be inspired by great advice, fostered by a great culture, and unleashed by free markets. It is time, in democracy and economics, to replace the preoccupation with corporatist power with the celebration of human freedom.

Do Fundamental Index Funds Outperform Traditional Index Funds?,"Traditional index funds (TIF) allocate investments in such a way that chosen firms have the same weight as they do in a price-weighted, capitalization-weighted, or similar measure of market behavior. Fundamental index funds (FIF) allocate cash in such a way that more money is spent on stocks with book value, cash flow, dividends, and net income characteristics that supposedly lead to higher subsequent investment returns. The potential advantages of fundamental indexing have stoked debate between supporters of traditional capitalization-weighted index funds and advocates of more recently created fundamental index funds. Using the universe of index ETFs and mutual funds with at least five years of data, this study documents the performance of FIFs and TIFs since the 2008-2009 market meltdown. Cost, return, risk, and risk-adjusted returns measures were used to compare the allocation methods. Authors found that index fund providers were able to increase return, but also added risk. Although risk-adjusted returns in general were insignificant, fundamental weightings tended to enhance domestic returns when the market advanced.","Chang, C Edward, PhD;Krueger, Thomas M, DBA", Feature,Dec,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Asset allocation , Index funds , Portfolio performance , Rates of return",ProQuest One Academic

Building Trust Through Communication,"In 2006, Robert F. Hurley, a professor of management at Fordham University in New York, wrote a significant article on the topic of trust and communication. In ""The Decision to Trust,"" published in the September 2006 issue of Harvard Business Review, Hurley discussed the 10 factors related to whether people will trust. Three of the factors relate to the individual and are the result of a complex mix of personality, culture, and experience (for instance, risk tolerance). Seven of the factors relate to the situation or the person to whom trust will (at least to some degree) be granted (for instance, whether the person being granted trust shows benevolent concern or is perceived as capable). The gap between moderate and complete trust may be an issue of fact (an adviser is not doing some of these things,) or of communication (the client is not fully aware of what the adviser is doing). Here are communication tips to enhance trust: 1. Be predictable. 2. Assume less. 3.

Updated Advice on Mutual Fund Selection,"In 2012, the author published a literature review in the Journal of Financial Service Professionals on the characteristics of actively managed mutual funds that are indicative of future performance. The main takeaways were that a high level of fund manager ownership, board of director ownership, a short-term redemption fee, a high active share or low R-squared value, and being unaffiliated with an investment bank are all positively associated with future performance. Since that paper was published, new research has revealed additional characteristics to consider when selecting mutual funds. In the working paper, ""Outsourcing of Mutual Funds' Non-Core Competencies,"" Christoph Sorhage compares the performance of mutual funds that administer their shareholder services in-house versus those that outsource these non-core tasks to external firms. He finds that funds that outsource all of their shareholder services outperform their counterparts by 39 to 253 basis points per year, depending on metric of performance and performance regression model specification.","Nanigian, David, PhD", Feature,Nov,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Mutual funds , Stockholders , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

From Functioning to Flourishing: Applying Positive Psychology to Financial Planning,"This paper introduces positive psychology, illustrates how it overlaps with financial planning, and provides specific scientifically based tools and resources that financial planners can use to integrate positive psychology into their practice. Financial planning has naturally evolved from helping clients function financially to helping clients improve their well-being and quality of life, as evidenced in life planning, financial coaching, and financial counseling. Positive psychology has had a similar evolution over the past decade to explore how people can optimize their well-being to thrive, prosper, and flourish in life. Financial planning and positive psychology align through the notion of positive financial planning. Two client case studies illustrate that positive psychology can be integrated within financial planning in three basic ways: as a perspective and orientation to financial planning, as a source of scientifically based information to bring to financial planning conversations, and as a positive intervention to help clients move through financial and life changes to maximize their well-being.","Asebedo, Sarah D, CFP®;Seay, Martin C, PhD, CFP®", Feature,Nov,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Psychology , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Mastering the Lost Art of Listening,"When you are meeting with a prospect or client, there are two things you can do: talk or listen. Unfortunately, most financial advisers are under the misconception that the more they talk, the more information they are sharing or explaining, and that that's a good thing. One of your main tasks as their adviser is to ensure that when you spend time with clients, that you are not just talking to them, but more importantly, you are listening to them. People don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care. If you are genuinely interested in understanding and you are truly listening to clients at this kind of level, they will realize that you do care.","Finley, Daniel C", Commentary,Nov,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Listening , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Daily interaction is almost always reactive as you respond to what others post. An effective adviser marketing plan starts with weekly content creation or curation aimed specifically at the concerns and aspirations of your target client. Each time you upload a blog post or publish a new video, be sure to share it across all of your social media accounts.

Clients will hang with you through a few tough quarters, or longer, if they trust you. And trust is a two-way street. If you have people's trust as a peer, they feel they can trust you as a professional. Sometimes it's a long process. You may stay in touch with prospective clients for years before they say they're ready to do something with you.

Supreme Court Opens Door to Rare Tax Refund Opportunity,"In its Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v.

This offers a significant opportunity for affected taxpayers to claim tax refunds from their resident states, cities, or counties. The Supreme Court's ruling opens the door to refund claims across the country, because cities and counties rarely allow credits for taxes paid to nonresident jurisdictions where a resident's income is taxed, and resident states rarely allow credits for taxes paid to nonresident cities and counties. Refunds for all open tax years (generally 2014, 2013, and 2012) are available. Those who extended their 2011 returns may have until Oct 15, 2015 to amend their 2011 returns.

Five key elements are required to deliver empathetic service that, in turn, grow the business by engendering client loyalty. 1. putting honor in service, 2. authority to act, 3. CRM for workflows and tracking, 4. client feedback, and 5. service reporting. The experiences a client has in being released from big and small burdens become stories that are retold.

One of the paper's purposes was to re-validate the benefits of a valuation-based asset allocation policy compared to various set-it-and-forget-it glide paths. Understanding this additional contribution and its implications is this column's subject. Practitioners should be aware when your portfolio's fixed income make-up differs from the composition modeled in research on which you base retirement income advice. Remind yourself that the fixed income allocation's ""primary purpose is to defend against equity declines and be available to reinvest for better equity returns (via rebalancing), not to be a return driver itself"". Perhaps the current low need not be so concerning if a portfolio's shorter-term bond volatility is closer to that of Treasury bills than intermediate-term Treasuries.

Dollar-Cost Averaging: The Trade-Off Between Risk and Return,"Traditional modern portfolio theory is a static model with only one time horizon. This study extends this static model to a dynamic setting in which investors have to decide how to invest over time. This framework can explain why dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is so popular among investors in spite of the many academic studies claiming that a lump-sum investing strategy is superior. The approach presented here analyzes both the expected return and the standard deviation, showing that there is a trade-off between these two variables. Although the expected return is higher for lump-sum investing than for DCA, the standard deviation of lump-sum investing is also higher than that of DCA. Depending on an investor's level of risk aversion, an investor may not want to invest all of his or her money in risky assets at once. Instead, the investor may want to invest equal amounts over time to reduce the risk. Results suggest that despite the fact that it provides a lower return than lump-sum investing, DCA can still be an optimal investment strategy for certain investors.","Cho, David D, PhD;Kuvvet, Emre, PhD", Feature,Oct,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Standard deviation , Risk aversion , Expected returns , Investment policy , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

However, with issues of liquidity, what has been used to determine a stock's liquidity cannot be necessarily applied to ETFs. When an ETF is trading at low volumes, it doesn't mean there is low liquidity. There is a lot of liquidity in the underlying baskets, but one needs to be able to successfully access it. it is possible to shift around large quantities of cash in low-volume ETFs, but an investor needs to be more creative in the process.

Making Sense Out of Variable Spending Strategies for Retirees,"The purpose of this paper is to identify and classify key variable spending strategies, and to develop simple metrics to evaluate and compare the strategies on an equal basis. As an alternative to failure rates, this paper suggests comparing the distribution of outcomes for spending and remaining wealth for different strategies, and calibrating initial spending rates using the following customized ""XYZ formula"" determined by the financial planner and client. This review provides a summary of research on variable spending by identifying and describing key representative variable spending strategies and classifying them into a general taxonomy with two subsets: decision rule methods and actuarial methods. Each strategy was simulated using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations for stock and bond returns. As a general distinction, decision rule strategies tend to put retirement income spending rules in place at the start of retirement, while actuarial methods allow for more revision over time for the expected portfolio returns and remaining time horizon.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Oct,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Monte Carlo simulation , Pension costs , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Tail Risk Hedging: State of the Market,"In planners work in risk-managed investing, one of their weapons is the design and management of a diversified suite of cost-effective ""tail risk hedges"" -- i.e., devices that attempt to mitigate the impact of equity market downturns that are rare but potentially catastrophic. As part of this effort, they try to maintain close, collaborative relationships with key thought leaders in this area from other financial advisory and asset management firms, investment banks, and risk consultants of various types. Earlier this year, we introduced a bit more formality into these ongoing efforts by issuing a request for proposa to the aforementioned firms to see if there were any recent improvements in tail risk hedging that they may have overlooked. One major categorization of volatility is ""realized"" versus ""implied."" Realized volatility is typically the standard deviation of the S&amp;P 500 over some recent number of days or weeks. With respect to implied volatility, there is no shortage of available investment vehicles that can provide you access.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFP, CFA, FCAS, CERA;Chow, Gladys, CIMA", Feature,Sep,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Request for proposal , Hedging , Asset management , Recessions , Volatility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Robo-Advisers: The Gateway to Millennials,"The debate about robo-advisers rages on in the financial planning world. While some news reports claim that advisers aren't really interested in attracting millennial business, others claim planners are desperately trying to. Though most millennials may not have the kind of assets that attract top financial advisers, they certainly might one day. And right now, they don't really want to work with human advisers, according to Go Banking Rates. They'd rather work with robo-advisers and other technological solutions. The Wells Fargo 2014 Millennial Study found that only 16% of millennials work with a financial adviser.

The Tax Man Cometh for Life Insurance Death Benefits,"Planners and clients often take for granted that life insurance proceeds paid by reason of the death of the insured are exempt from federal income tax. That exclusion of life insurance death benefits from the definition of income is found in IRC Section 101(a)(1). Similar to most tax code sections, however, the exclusion of life insurance death benefits from income has its exceptions. In the case of life insurance, the exception -- called the transfer for value rule -- states that if a life insurance policy is transferred for valuable consideration, the death benefit becomes taxable to the extent it exceeds the purchaser's basis in the policy. Individuals who create small businesses jointly owned with others typically enter into buy-sell agreements requiring surviving owners to purchase their interest at death. Tax law is only as permanent as Congress wants it to be. Planners have been able to rely on the techniques described here to protect their clients through the use of life insurance.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA", Feature,Sep,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Buy sell agreements , Tax legislation , Life insurance , Death benefits , Accelerated death benefits , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Initial Conditions and Optimal Retirement Glide Paths,"The body of research exploring the optimal glide path shape for investors, both for accumulation and distribution phases of retirement, continues to grow. Traditional financial planning theory generally suggests that the retirement glide path should include an equity allocation approximating 100% minus an investor's age. Different approaches exist, but the optimal glide path shape is commonly assumed to decrease throughout someone's lifetime, meaning the portfolio should become more conservative as the individual approaches retirement. Retirees need to consider both initial bond yields and stock market conditions at retirement. In this paper, two key indicators were used to forecast the future returns of bonds and stocks; namely, 10-year US government bond yields and the Shiller CAPE ratio, respectively. Bond yields provide a great deal of insight to the future returns of bonds, because a majority of the return on bonds is the coupon, which is known at the time of purchase.","Blanchett, M David", Feature,Sep,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement , Financial planning , Bonds , Securities markets , Yield , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Survey Says: Groom Your Talent,"A survey of FPA members, conducted by Cerrulli and Associates earlier this year, found that the higher a firm's assets under management are, the more likely it is they'll need to hire some support staff. According to the survey, about 43% of practices employ at least one non-producing service or support adviser, and about 34% employ at least one producing junior adviser.

The Next Generation of Communication,"Authentic communication cultivates productive relationships and can quickly transform a young planner into a business-generating machine. Focusing on this art, rather than simply hammering away at financial knowledge, helps remove invisible barriers that might otherwise derail fruitful relationships. Clients and referral partners latch on to someone who can blend authenticity and vulnerability in a way that shows confidence and trust. By focusing on building strong relationships via authentic communication across all mediums, up-and-coming advisers from the millennial generation can catapult themselves ahead of their peers -- and perhaps even more experienced advisers. The next generation of financial planners should be trained to build relationships first. Gaining experience takes time, yet learning how to have productive conversations with people simply takes practice. The financial planning industry must learn to be less controlling and salesy, and more generous and vulnerable if they want to expand and thrive. If they adjust their training programs to focus on communication and leadership skills, they will tap into a hidden realm of possibilities in millennial planners.","Roberge, Eric, CFP", Feature,Sep,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Communication , Leadership training , Financial planning , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Who Are the Next Generation of Planners and Clients?,"Among millennial financial planners, many of them have similar stories. Whether it's a family member's lack of financial knowledge to make sound financial decisions that are affecting their lives today, divorced parents (which can result in a major emotional and financial hit), or just the taboo notion of talking about money within their families. With almost every conversation, there is a similarity among millennial planners. Impact and innovation are common themes that emerge in conversations with my peers. Millennial planners entering this profession have graduated from one of the more than 350 CFP Board registered programs, and are fueled with passion. It is no surprise that technology is a part of the millennial DNA. Millennial planners committing to being practitioners are choosing one of two roads -- traditional or nontraditional.

A Blueprint for Retirement Spending,"Considerable research on optimal and sustainable retirement spending strategies has been conducted over the last two decades. This paper aims to guide planners and clients toward an appropriate spending strategy based on client preference. The analysis specifically looks at systematic spending strategies -- those that employ a pre-defined method of spending. The intent is to review the lessons from existing research and determine which are applicable to different types of clients. By doing so, planners can help clients approaching retirement draft a strategic blueprint for spending from savings. Throughout this study, existing research is presented and the findings are confirmed with an original analysis, which uses a variety of methods and definitions that are briefly described here.

The Evidence-Based Financial Planner,"Financial planners often adopt and share with colleagues practices that are born of trial-and-error and intuition rather than empirical validation. At the same time, academic research focused on financial planning is too often answering questions financial planners aren't asking. The obvious solution is to find better ways to connect financial planners who know the crucial questions of the day with the academics who have the knowledge and skill to conduct the necessary research to answer those questions. FPA has been working diligently on the solution, first by forging a deeper partnership with the Academy of Financial Services, the oldest association devoted to the interests of financial planning educators and researchers; and secondly, through the creation of the new FPA Theory in Practice Knowledge Circle.

History of Cash Value Life Insurance and Implications for Existing Policies,"Cash value life insurance has an interesting history. About 1977 marks the period that national high interest rates started showing up in participating whole life (PWL) dividend values and when mutual companies started providing a ""dividend interest rate"" figure. The primary insurance products sold until the early 1980s were PWL policies sold by the mutual companies, and whole life policies sold by stock companies. Early in the 1980s, universal life (UL) was introduced, offering buyers double-digit interest crediting rates (new money rates) that were higher than PWL's portfolio rates. Year 1993 marks the year when PWL dividends and UL crediting rates began to gradually decline as lower interest rates dug in. Around 2009, another new policy type became popular, indexed universal life, which promises that its interest crediting rates are determined by reference to the S&amp;P 500 stock index with no losses.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Feature,Aug,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," History , Universal life , Insurance policies , Interest rates , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Meb Faber on Smart Beta, Robo-Advisers, and Why You're Overthinking Asset Allocation","In an interview, Meb Faber, Co-founder and chief investment officer of Cambria Investment Management, author of Global Asset Allocation and Global Value, talked about smart beta and asset allocation. As most asset classes -- through indexing and ETFs and mutual funds -- are very accessible for a super low cost. If you're doing buy-and-hold investing and you have some global stocks, some bonds, and some real assets, the exact amount doesn't matter that much; as long as you have those three ingredients, then the precise asset allocation becomes less material. Smart beta is a term Faber tries to avoid, though all five of the ETFs could be classified as smart beta depending on who you ask. In many cases, smart beta is an excuse to charge more and to say you're active or you're doing something that's super alpha-generating and proprietary, but really, most of them are formulaic and should be had for probably 60 basis points or less.","Schulaka, Carly", Feature,Aug,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Asset allocation , Exchange traded funds , Investment policy , United States--US , Faber, Meb",ProQuest One Academic

ABLE Act Considerations for Estate Planning,"On Dec 19, 2014, Pres Obama signed into law the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act. This Act added a section, Section 529A, to the Internal Revenue Code to allow for the creation of a new type of qualified, tax-advantaged savings account, termed an ABLE account (or 529A account). Qualified ABLE account assets are not subject to the current income tax and thus accumulate on a tax-free basis. In essence, the ABLE accounts are likely to be most appealing for those with disabilities who work and seek to save more than $2,000, as well as for the families who need a place to deposit gifts or inheritances from family members. ABLE accounts are not sensible for families who wish to fund larger dollar amounts on behalf of a disabled beneficiary over time in excess of the maximum account limit. For families saving for a disabled child's future, the ABLE account will serve as a significant and viable supplement to the special needs trust.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP, CTFA, AEP", Feature,Aug,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Federal legislation , Disabled people , Savings accounts , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

This study builds on previous HIFO research by investigating the impact of volatility of returns on the benefit provided by HIFO accounting to determine if more volatile securities have a greater tax benefit. Results indicate that the effect of volatility on the total dollar benefit of HIFO is not always clear. However, when expressed as a percentage of wealth, above-average volatility increases the HIFO benefit substantially after controlling for return. While, on average, HIFO can increase wealth by about 1%, more volatile assets may have HIFO benefits three times as large.

Sustainable Retirement Spending with Low Interest Rates: Updating the Trinity Study,"The Trinity Study is one of the hallmark studies in retirement income planning.

By mixing the S&amp;P 500 with long-term corporate bonds, the Trinity study calculated that a 4% initial spending rate, with subsequent spending adjusting upwards for inflation, would have survived in 95% of the historical rolling 30-year periods when using a 50/50 portfolio. Sustainable spending rates are tied closely to the underlying market returns, and with sequence of returns risk, the market returns experienced early in retirement have a disproportionate impact on the final outcomes.

Reassessing Risk: Considering indexed universal life as an alternative to traditional conservative investments,"When investing, people generally seek to obtain the highest return possible given the amount of risk they are able and willing to tolerate. Unfortunately, gauging the degree of risk associated with various investments is not always easy. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate carry their own varying degrees of risk and also lack guaranteed results, but many people consider these known risks, where they believe they have sufficient information available to confidently project future results. The lack of familiarity with life insurance as an asset class can prevent people from applying a similar, objective analysis to insurance products. Nothing in life is risk-free, and indexed universal life insurance products are no exception. Interestingly, though, the concerns about these products that are most often cited are ones that are (at least statistically) extremely remote. In an effort to demystify this conservative investment alternative, this article presents an overview of how indexed universal life insurance works and the risks most likely to impact performance.","Smith, Jordan H, JD, LLM", Cover Story,Aug,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Universal life , Life insurance , Investment policy , Risk assessment , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
A Fresh Look at Life Insurance in Periods of Uncertainty,"A properly balanced planning strategy can allow clients at any stage of their financial plan to capture the significant long-term appreciation of the equity markets while thoughtfully apportioning assets in cash or cash alternatives for liquidity needs. These liquidity needs start with death, continue with emergencies and the inevitable bear market, and extend to distressed investment opportunities such as buying a piece of real estate amidst a market crash. Life insurance is an asset whose unique and most important characteristic -- the death benefit -- provides certain cash to heirs at the policyholder's death. Traditional dividend-paying whole life insurance on its own can be a compelling asset to own in any market environment. When you factor in the benefits of its unique liquidity characteristics at death and during life, it can have a significant impact on an individual's overall portfolio performance.","Tiboris, E Peter, CFP, CLU, ChFC, CAP", Feature,Aug,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Life insurance , Portfolio investments , Portfolio performance , Death benefits , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
7 Long-Term Care Insurance Trends to Watch,"Long-term care insurance (LTCI) is a young product by industry standards. As such, it continues to grow and evolve at a rapid pace. The first LTCI policies appeared just 41 years ago, in 1974. Compare that to life insurance, which has been around since the early 1700s. The LTCI industry is still learning and changing accordingly. Here are seven trends to watch about where the product and industry is headed in 2015: 1. Younger consumers are buying LTCI. 2. More consumers are partially self-insuring. 3. Costs and claims are rising. 4. Premiums are rising, but moderately. 5. Underwriting refinements continue. 6. Policy innovations are on the way. 7. Asset-based plans are growing in popularity. People are living longer, resulting in a greater likelihood of needing care. An unplanned long-term care event can decimate the most meticulous financial and retirement plans while placing enormous stress on families.

Crosby's one big lesson is, that in every market, you control what matters most. Most people aren't too keen on accepting responsibility for anything really, so what ought to be an empowering message is one that is too often ignored. The most important thing planners could be doing is to always be building up that money in the bank with their clients, so when it comes time for them to ask them to do something uncomfortable, they feel like they owe them one. Meanwhile, there's a lot of upside to crazy.

Reduce Retirement Costs with Deferred Income Annuities Purchased before Retirement,"Most deferred income annuities (DIA) have a relatively short deferral period, making them particularly appealing to clients nearing retirement who value the ability to plan on a fixed, nominal income stream after retirement. Unlike long-term deferral period annuities (longevity insurance) that are primarily meant to protect against longevity risk, a short-term deferral period annuity can provide a steady income to pre-fund retirement spending over the entire retirement life cycle. The purchase of a DIA before retirement is particularly valuable for clients who would have maintained a stock allocation lower than 70 percent. Retirees would have been better off without a DIA in simulations where portfolio returns are very high or when retirees die early. Findings suggest that short deferral period annuities can reduce the cost of funding retirement, provide longevity protection, and offer behavioral benefits to clients concerned about near-retirement market performance.","Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Jul,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Federal funding , Deferred income , Retirees , Retirement planning , Annuities , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Market Your Firm through Consumer Education,"You may not immediately think of educating consumers as a meaningful marketing strategy, but at Simply Money's financial planning firm, consumer education is the primary marketing focus. The firm's co-founder and CEO, Nathan Bachrach, spends most of his time speaking and writing about personal finance. His goal is to explain what clients need to know in everyday English -- in keeping with the firm's name. When it comes to marketing, the firm's educational focus has done an amazing thing for them: they don't have to do seminar campaigns or other outbound marketing. They think of Simply Money media as the client magnet. Simply Money is more than a radio show, and they're more than a financial planning firm -- they have earned consumers' trust even before they walk in the door.","Purvis, Deanna, CFP", Commentary,Jul,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Consumer education , Best practice , Marketing , Consumers , Customer relations , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
CFP Board Celebrates 30th Anniversary,"In the year 1985, the Dow Jones Industrial average achieved a first-ever close above 1,500. The bull market in bonds was also underway with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note around 11 percent and descending by year's end. And the new vehicle for Americans to save for retirement -- the 401(k) -- was celebrating its fifth anniversary. That same year Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board of Standards Inc was founded. Thirty years later they find themselves at a very different place in history. The Dow has risen more than 100-fold, breaching the 18,000 mark. Interest rates, still at an all-time low, may be poised for a climb. What hasn't changed is CFP Board's unwavering pursuit of its mission to benefit the public by upholding the certified financial planner certification as the recognized standard of excellence for competent and ethical personal financial planning.

Limit Rising Rate Risks with a Hedged Bond ETF,"The Federal Reserve is pushing off interest rate hikes, but bond investors will eventually have to contend with a rising-rate environment. Instead of shifting a fixed-income portfolio down the yield curve or into cash to diminish the effects of rising rates, consider an interest-rate-hedged bond ETF to potentially enhance returns. Advisers seeking a little more yield can consider hedged corporate bond ETFs. Interest-rate-hedged, investment-grade bond ETF options include the iShares Interest Rate Hedged Corporate Bond ETF (LQDH), ProShares Investment Grade-Interest Rate Hedged ETF (IGHG), and the recently launched Deutsche X-trackers Investment Grade Bond-Interest Rate Hedged ETF (IGIH).

How Anchoring Biases Influence Clients' Financial Behavior,"The work of Daniel Kahneman, Nobel-prize winning economist, psychologist, and author of Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow, has spread the concept of a rule of thumb called ""anchoring bias."" The anchoring biases of clients who resist sound advice presume intuitive knowledge or instincts that supersede the analyses of a fiduciary. Some anchors are formulated from people's personal experiences, or even passed down from generation to generation. Some are good guidelines, but others could get clients in trouble. Anchoring biases should be identified and periodically reviewed. Investors are people, and people have biases that they may not be aware of that could negatively impact their finances. Part of an adviser's job should be to help clients discover these biases and illuminate their potential consequences. Preferably, a client self-discovers his or her anchoring biases through a questionnaire or quiz, similar to the implicit-association test, which reveals hidden racial or gender biases.","Astorino, Francis X, CFP, CPWA", Feature,Jun,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Bias , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

This is clearly true when someone chooses to work longer. Meanwhile, a bridge portfolio could be applied in more comprehensive situations involving a couple and/or with multiple defined benefit income streams with multiple start dates.

Not in the Family: When to Name a Corporate Trustee,"The main advantages of naming a corporate trustee are expertise, experience, resources, and impartiality. The oft-mentioned disadvantages are cost, insensitivity to or lack of familiarity with family circumstances, and bureaucracy. An often overlooked advantage of naming a corporate trustee is the organization's fiduciary responsibility. A corporate trustee is required to look out for the interests of all beneficiaries equally. It is important for the client and adviser to look into the corporate trustee's requirements to ensure the trustee will accept the appointment before the client finalizes the documents. The adviser should inquire whether there are any particular clauses or language that would cause the trustee to refuse to serve. In certain circumstances, the best way to keep wealth in the family is to have someone outside the family manage the wealth. This reasoning leads clients to use financial advisers and corporate trustees.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Daff, Charles, JD", Feature,Jun,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Client relationships , Wealth management , Fiduciary responsibility , Trustees , Family trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Strategies to Increase Financial Asset Ownership among U.S. Hispanics,"Financial planners should pay close attention to national trends in financial asset and financial product ownership. Hispanics have lower levels of asset ownership compared to other segments of the US population. Financial asset ownership is closely associated with family saving behavior. Financial risk tolerance, which is defined as a person's willingness to take on additional risk or uncertainty in exchange for higher expected returns, also plays a key role in financial asset ownership among Hispanics in the US. Networks of family and friends and cultural values are another determinant of financial asset ownership among Hispanics. Financial institutions and intermediaries, particularly those desiring to capture a greater share of the fast-growing Hispanic market segment in the US, can implement several strategies to increase financial asset ownership among this population group. Several of these strategies are: 1: Increase financial education and literacy. 2: Promote, support, and implement policies and initiatives. 3: Provide individualized and customized comprehensive financial planning.","González-Corzo, Mario A, PhD", Feature,Jun,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Hispanics , Target markets , Investment policy , Hispanic Americans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Exploring 2 Stubborn Investment Issues: Universal or funded-goal portfolios, and simultaneous or sequential savings?","Planners must make a variety of recommendations; some with a sound theoretic basis, some based on rules of thumb or best guesses. Although the investments field has a massive research base, advisors often must choose between alternative investment worldviews when considering client recommendations. People can agree that in selecting portfolios whose assets are held for a particular goal, you should consider time horizon, the importance of the goal to the client, and the client's level of risk aversion. Financial planners can get consumed with technology: simulation modeling, sensitivity analysis, hedging, rebalancing, tax location, and others, ad infinitum. These are important and useful tools, but some unresolved issues depend on out understanding of basic financial math. Most planners seem to agree that working to achieve client goals simultaneously has distinct advantages.

The Value of Goals-Based Financial Planning,"The financial planning profession is built on helping people accomplish goals. While investing appropriately is generally an important part of accomplishing a goal, achieving a goal often requires advice beyond selecting investments based on alpha and beta.

In contrast, the focus of this research is how to determine which goals should be funded, as well as how to optimally save toward goals over time. A utility model based on prospect theory was used to determine the optimal funding strategy for a household. The results suggest that using a goals-based framework to determine which goals to fund and how to fund them can lead to an increase in utility-adjusted wealth of 15.09% for a hypothetical household versus a naive strategy focused only on funding retirement.","Blanchett, David, CFP, CFA", Feature,Jun,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Goal setting , Financial planning , Funding , Households , Studies , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Tips for Choosing an Actively Managed Bond ETF,"When financial planners choose bond ETFs, it is typically for their income, diversification, and liquidity characteristics -- important features for helping clients achieve their investment objectives. Therefore, the authors propose that planners also look for active management in bond ETFs. Choosing the right active bond ETF for your clients involves some research. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, so planners should look at additional aspects aside from the expense ratios and previous returns. Some key considerations in choosing an active bond ETF include: 1. the research and trading resources of the manager; 2. the benchmark of the strategy; 3. the overall level of risk within the strategy; 4. the sources of risk within the strategy; 5. other elements of the ETF mandate, including any guidelines or restrictions; and 6. the structural risk controls. Consequently, various active management strategies can augment total returns for active bond ETFs, even in a rising-rate environment.","Atluri, Pramod, CFA;O'Neil, Ford", Feature,Jun,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Guidelines , Bond portfolios , Exchange traded funds , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Ultimately, this is why clients hire planners. Most of them have these kinds of discussions with their clients daily. And they really matter. At times, they need to encourage certain clients to take action. Other times, they need to ask them to explore why they are making choices that seem personally incongruent.

Incorporating the ABLE Act into Special Needs Planning,"On Dec 19, 2014 President Obama signed the Achieving a Better Life Experience, or ABLE Act, into law. The ABLE Act provides a vehicle for families to save for the future care of their child with special needs through an account made available by similar legislation for 529 college savings plans. This article provides a brief history of the ABLE Act, an overview of the rules, a comparison with other savings options, and specific examples where ABLE accounts can typically be the most appropriate planning strategies. The funds in an ABLE account can grow tax deferred and will come out tax free when used to pay for qualified expenses for the beneficiary. One difference between the ABLE account and the 529 college savings account is that in a 529 account the owner is the donor and the beneficiary is the college student.

Reversing the Dialogue,"The author quickly found that the way financial advisers have been selling isn't working because what they have been doing isn't actually selling, but more like telling. So, as an adviser, the solution on how you get a client or prospect to buy with confidence isn't only about what you say but about the questions you ask so that clients or prospects come to the conclusion that they want or need what you are recommending. The way to do this is to reverse the dialogue -- determine the conclusion that you'd like the individual to come to and map out the questions you would ask, in reverse order, until you get to the starting point of the conversation. Reversing the dialogue works for a few reasons: it gives you a visual of the question path; it gives you an opportunity to get prospects involved; and it helps you systematize the process.","Finley, Daniel C", Feature,May,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Client relationships , Sales prospecting , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Investors May Take Heart: A Game Theoretic View of High Frequency Trading,"High frequency trading (HFT) provides infrastructure for trading at speeds unimaginable only a decade ago. Using high speed infrastructure and special, but opaque, relationships with some exchanges, some high frequency traders are able to glean order flow information ahead of other traders and profit from it. The current arrangement is beneficial for HFTs and exchanges, but detrimental for investors. A relatively new stock exchange, IEX, has taken the lead in devising a system that denies preferential access to any trader (including HFTs) by providing an order routing system that eliminates the time lags between when an order reaches various exchanges. This is changing the incentive structure for stock exchanges and many may change their behavior in the future. In the meantime, to preserve the wealth of their clients, financial planners are advised to route large orders through IEX. Small orders need not be routed through IEX, but one must take the precaution of using limit orders at the quoted bid or ask price.","Pandey, Vivek K, DBA, CFA, FRM;Wu, Chen Y, PhD", Feature,May,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Investors , Game theory , Stock exchanges , High frequency trading , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Back to the Future for Life Insurance and Retirement Planning,"In February, US Pres Obama released the Administration's Fiscal Year 2016 Green Book, detailing his budget and tax proposals for the fiscal year beginning in October 2015. The 2016 Green Book proposes several significant changes to tax policy that planners and clients have relied on for decades. Although it is unlikely that all of these provisions will be adopted into law, they may influence the direction of tax policy. Some of the proposals would have a direct impact on uses of life insurance in financial planning. Life insurance is used in personal financial planning for two primary purposes: 1. to hedge against the risk of loss of human capital, and 2. to enhance wealth on a tax-free basis. If some or all of the President's Green Book proposals are adopted into law, the demand for life insurance to enhance the family's wealth on a tax-free basis will likely increase. If Congress adopts the President's proposals, clients and planners will have to adjust their strategies back to the future.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA", Feature,May,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Fiscal policy , Tax planning , Life insurance , Proposals , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Confirming the Value of Rising Equity Glide Paths: Evidence from a Utility Model,"Rising equity glide paths during retirement can offer equal or improved financial outcomes compared with static allocations. This study confirms the work by Pfau and Kitces using a utility model of constant relative risk aversion. Increased pension income may encourage retirees to tolerate more risk with retirement savings. Increased risk tolerance entails larger planned withdrawals and/or higher equity allocations. As retirees age, pension income (in the form of employer pensions and Social Security) will likely become more important as financial savings dwindle. As a consequence, it is optimal for retirees to increase withdrawals as a percentage of the remaining savings and to increase equity allocation later in retirement. This finding aligns with the benefits of the rising equity glide path. Retirement withdrawal amounts have a larger impact on financial outcomes than equity allocations. Retirees should focus first on managing spending before trying to enhance performance through innovative methods of asset allocation.","Delorme, Luke F", Feature,May,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Risk aversion , Utility functions , Asset allocation , Retirees , Equity , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Also, Adam Beck, assistant professor of health insurance at The American College, some provisions of the ACA either haven't taken effect, therefore there could be a delay, potentially this year, in the change in the definition of small group market.

Low-Beta Investing: Why and How?,"The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by William Sharpe and John Lintner, provides investors with a simple and intuitive model for how they should be compensated for bearing systematic risk, which affects the entire market and cannot be eliminated through diversification. The CAPM says that there is a one-to-one relationship between the sensitivity of a stock's excess return to variation in the excess return on the stock market, and the expected return on the stock. But the existence of ""gamblers"" in the stock market creates greater demand for high beta stocks than for low beta stocks. The strong demand for high beta stocks from ""gamblers"" and borrowing-constrained investors combined with the tracking error volatility constraints faced by institutional investors make a compelling case for individuals to employ a strategy of investing in low beta stocks. Financial planners can construct this strategy for their clients through investing in a diversified portfolio of individual stocks with low betas.","Nanigian, David, PhD", Feature,May,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Guidelines , Stock exchanges , Capital assets , Portfolio diversification , Institutional investments , Beta , CAPM , Securities markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Don't Let Clients Become Identity Theft Victims,"As a trusted financial planner, part of your role is to protect client assets and safeguard their privacy. This is an opportunity for you to advise clients on protecting their personal privacy, preventing identity theft, and suggesting proven strategies to greatly reduce their risks. The primary types of identity theft are: financial identity theft, driver's license identity theft, Social Security and IRS identity theft, medical identity theft, child identity theft, and synthetic identity theft. Meanwhile, the greatest tool in preventing information from being stolen and used illegally is the security freeze. Additionally, your clients should never use their home address because that information is sold to marketing lists and becomes public information. Avoid being hacked by using a two-factor authentication, which involves using a username and password plus a secondary level of security, such as security codes sent via text. Also, always use a Virtual Private Network service when using public WiFi.","VanderPal, Geoffrey, DBA, CFP", Feature,May,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial counseling , Guidelines , Security management , Identity theft , Privacy , Virtual private networks , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The three strategies for sustainable spending from dedicated income resources for a 65-year-old couple include: 1. Buy a joint/100% survivor's life-only single premium immediate annuity. 2. Buy a ladder of bonds maturing over the next 30 years. 3. Buy a ladder of bonds maturing over the next 20 years and purchase a deferred income annuity that will continue the same income level and trend in years 21 and beyond.

The Return on Investment for Delaying Social Security Beyond Age 62,"For individuals who have a realistic choice of deciding when to retire, and for those not being forced into early retirement because of lack of employment opportunities, poor health, the need to care for a spouse, or any other possible reasons for early retirement, the decision of when to claim Social Security retirement benefits should be carefully examined. The Social Security retirement decision can have a major impact on the future lifetime benefits and the standard of living in retirement. Using basic investment cash flow analysis techniques, this paper examines the rate of return on investment on delayed benefits compared to the increase in future benefits received as a result of delaying the start of Social Security from age 62 to age 66, and from age 62 to age 70 for individuals and married couples using the spousal benefit. This paper also examines the impact of the delay on the recipient's future standard of living as measured by the percentage of income replacement in retirement at various levels of earned income.","Rose, Clarence C, PhD", Feature,Apr,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement , Age , Early retirement , Standard of living , Return on investment , Social security , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Counseling a Client with Addiction: Tough Love Is Not the Answer,"Addiction has become the new taboo. Many planners are increasingly finding that their clients and their loved ones are struggling with this unhealthy, expensive, and often life-threatening disease. Their behavior effects everyone by inadvertently drawing in family, friends, and business associates. Naturally, it is the responsibility of the clinician and/or therapist to diagnose and treat such problems. However, financial planners and wealth managers play an increasingly important part in assisting families on issues of family governance, asset transfers, and philanthropy. In my opinion, turning a blind eye by encouraging ""tough love"" is not a viable solution. The best advice you can give is: don't deny addiction, don't enable it, and don't wait. By simply facilitating the difficult issues, planners will find that their clients will come closer to achieving their goals once they acknowledge the addiction in the family, and bravely, intentionally move together toward recovery in the protective provisions outlined in governing their estate and trust documents.","Seeber, Catherine M, CFP®", Feature,Apr,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Duty of care , Addictions , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Holding out as a ""financial planner"" only triggers the need to register as an investment adviser representative. What regulators could and should do is at least limit the use of the title ""financial adviser"" to people who are actually advisers rather than sales reps, attach the title to a bona fide fiduciary duty, and ban hat-switching.

Retirement Planning for Workers Impacted by the Windfall Elimination Provision,"Workers who have a mix of earnings and retirement benefits from employment in and outside the Social Security system may face more complexities with respect to retirement planning than if their careers were in one retirement system or the other. Currently, the most common sources of employment outside the Social Security system include state and local governments that do not participate in the Social Security system, as well as postings outside the US. For workers whose careers have been split between these two retirement programs, the interaction of the two programs makes estimating a worker's expected retirement income more challenging, and these job switchers -- and the financial planners who assist them -- need to understand how non-covered retirement programs interact with Social Security in order to best prepare for retirement.

Due to the uneven growth outlook in the developing world, advisers can overweight specific countries instead of taking a broad emerging market position. Advisers who want a more small-cap focus can also use ETFs to target the asset category, such as the Market Vectors India Small-Cap Index ETF, EGShares India Small Cap ETF, or iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF.

Break that Habit: How to Help Clients Develop Better Investment Habits,"Habitual thoughts and actions pertaining to the financial markets influence many poor investment decisions. Financial advisers can play a significant role in helping clients develop better investment habits. This is a value-add approach that advisers can implement to further validate their advisory fee; this is important because the message from the mainstream media is that financial advisers are not worth their fee. Teaching and encouraging good investment habits is far more valuable than a simple portfolio recommendation, especially because the average investor is unable to stick with an investment strategy for more than a few years. In this article, the author will discuss the psychology behind resolutions, which often has to do with changing one or more habits to obtain a better outcome. He will then explain the nature of habits -- how they develop and what steps are needed to change them. Finally, specific investor habits will be examined, along with a practical application of how advisers can help clients cultivate better habits.","Mooreland, Jay", Feature,Apr,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Behavior modification , Financial planning , Client relationships , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Income-Based Repayment and Loan Forgiveness: Implications on Student Loan Debt,"When it comes to paying for college, student loans are indeed the norm, rather than the exception. For many young adults, exiting their college years and entering the workforce with sizable debt can be a life-long financial challenge. However, individuals with low income or high debt levels often benefit from income-based repayment plans. Repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs are scheduled to be expanded in 2015 and could dramatically change decisions about student loan debt. Payment amounts will be based on the ability to pay instead of the level of debt and interest rate.

Consequently, appropriate financial planning policies can play a powerful role in keeping clients committed to a consistent and disciplined course of action and in avoiding such biases. Ignoring or failing to grasp this concept can have a detrimental influence on investment performance. The authors' purpose is to examine some behavioral aspects of financial planning and investing.

A Captivating Idea,"Planners occasionally encounter clients with substantial family businesses. Often, these are closely and privately held companies, and can represent an outsized share of the client's wealth. Considered as a component of the family's overall investment portfolio, the enterprise is typically not only the largest but also the riskiest investment in the portfolio. It would, therefore, be prudent to explore effective ways to expertly manage the risk of that investment. In the authors' opinion, there is a particular risk management device that is very well suited to this task. It was developed decades ago by large corporations to provide themselves very customized and tax-efficient risk management, and has been increasingly used by small businesses for similar purposes. The approach involves creating, within or alongside the family business, a wholly owned insurance subsidiary -- a captive insurance company. What should be particularly noteworthy to planners, though, is this: beyond their risk management benefits, captives, if properly structured, can provide significant income tax, business, and gift/estate planning advantages to wealth management clients.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFP®, CFA®, FCAS, CERA;Chow, Gladys, CIMA®", Feature,Mar,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Family owned businesses , Wealth management , Captive insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

How to Incorporate Behavioral Finance Theory into a Planning Practice,"Several strategies for better understanding and implementing behavioral finance in your practices are presented. First, study the subject and read in the field. From the readings, choose specific exercises or topics that you find especially interesting. Once you feel confident enough to use the exercises and activities with your clients, begin to implement them with clients whom you believe will be most receptive. When determining the kind of bias becomes important, drill down to the major categories. It takes more time to explain behavioral finance to existing clients than it does to add it to the new client onboarding process. Keep the conversation focused on how the client's belief or bias is affecting the current planning and investing situation. Try to find a money coach, money therapist, psychologist, or other professional who is trained to work with people and their money psychology.

How Dumb Is Smart Beta? Analyzing the Growth of Fundamental Indexing,"In this study, after summarizing the fundamental index ETF's performance relative to the market benchmarks, the analysis starts with the decomposition of returns into the common four systematic factors: market, ""size"", ""value"", and momentum. This allows risks taken to be characterized by a fundamental index ETF by the factor loadings (traditional betas). This approach also helps identify performance attribution by multiplying the pre-computed betas by the realized returns of the factors, with the remainder being the unexplained alpha. This allows the source of a fund's outperformance to be identified, and the contribution of each fund's special approach to be quantified. The majority of reported outperformance is easily explained by market, size, book-to-market, and momentum tilts, with only pure style funds having some, and dividend funds having a large ""special"" component. This finding calls into question the suggestions of prior research that rebalancing frequency plays a major role in the outperformance of equal weighted funds.","Dubil, Robert, PhD", Feature,Mar,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Exchange traded funds , Dividend funds , Beta , Portfolio performance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Retirement Risk, Rising Equity Glide Paths, and Valuation-Based Asset Allocation","This study explores the interaction of two research threads relating to asset allocation in retirement: whether the optimal equity glide path should rise or fall throughout retirement (and at what pace those changes should occur), and/or whether retirement asset allocation should move up and down dynamically in response to stock market valuation extremes. The first research question relates to the appropriate default equity glide path for client portfolios during the retirement phase of the lifecycle. This analysis employed overlapping historical periods to simulate retirement outcomes for hypothetical retirees over rolling 30-year periods using different asset allocation strategies. Although the focus of the methodology was on determining the worst-case historical maximum sustainable withdrawal rate (SAFEMAX) for various allocation strategies across starting valuation environments, such an approach focuses specifically on the strategies that minimize risks in the worst outcomes.

Revisiting the Optimal Distribution Glide Path,"Debate continues regarding how an investor's equity allocation should change during retirement. This study tests four different changing equity glide path shapes: increasing, decreasing, V-shaped, and V-shaped contrasted against the potential benefit of a constant glide path. The decreasing glide path was found to be the optimal glide path shape across a wide range of scenarios based on the analysis; however, results showed no clear, one ideal glide path shape for each retiree scenario. The increasing glide path was noted to be the least efficient, and the V and V shapes fell in the middle.

Personalize Your Technology,"Technology continues to play an important role in the foundation of a successful financial planning business. Technology allows you to streamline your business processes, increase efficiency, and enforce consistency in the way you deliver planning advice. But there are crucial activities you perform that are lacking in technology. Technology can't make a judgment call, hold a client's hand, empathize with clients in challenging times, celebrate client milestones, juggle priorities, or offer a compromise. It's time to add personal qualities to your technology. Here's how: 1. Personalize your Web site. 2. Know your competition's tactics. 3. Be different. 4. Personalize your emails. 5. Be bold with video. 6. Make it compelling. Use technology to give clients and prospects something to which they can relate that differentiates your business from all the rest. Show clients and prospects the empathetic side of your business, and make the personal characteristics of your business known through the clever use of technology.","Winterberg, Bill, CFP", Feature,Feb,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Customization , Guidelines , Technological planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Long-Term Care Insurance: Comparisons for Determining the Best Options for Clients,"An estimated 8.36 million people need some type of long-term care (LTC) service annually. The American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance (AALTCI) recommends that individuals purchase LTC policies in their mid-1950s. The cost for LTC is increasing and currently averages $43,472 annually for adult day service center, to $87,600 for a private nursing home room. Studies show that most Americans are not financially prepared for LTC needs. This study evaluates various LTC solutions, including traditional LTC, variable annuity combination products, fixed annuity combination products, variable life insurance combinations, universal life combinations, and ""hybrid"" LTC. Results suggest the areas of differentiation include: cost per unit of coverage, case design flexibility, certainty of coverage, liquidity, investment upside, death benefit to heirs, and degree of medical underwriting required.","Finefrock, Christopher J, CFP;Gradisher, Suzanne M, JD, MTAX, CPA;Nitz, Caleb M, CFP", Feature,Feb,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Long term care insurance , Financial planning , Clients , Studies , Investment policy , Long term health care , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Cutting-Edge Estate Planning Strategies for Effective Wealth Transfer,"Ensuring a meaningful legacy for your clients and their loved ones is a challenging task. As a planner, you can now devise wealth transfer strategies to minimize tax implications and protect how your clients pass on financial assets and other property to family members. Lifetime gifts are preferable to testamentary transfers because they allow income and appreciation to grow free of any gift or estate tax for the grantors' heirs. Your clients are presently permitted to annually give up to $14,000 of assets or non-cash property without counting toward their indexed lifetime gift tax exemption of $5.43 million. Consider employing some estate planning techniques to maximize the timely benefits of these fundamental gifting strategies and to enhance the financial security of your clients' future generations. The estate planning techniques are for: 1. minimizing gift tax value, 2.magnifying wealth with a charitable benefit, 3. keeping wealth in the family, 4. gifting with advanced grantor techniques, 5. enhancing legacy planning, and 6. preserving family assets and relationships.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP, CTFA, AEP", Cover Story,Feb,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Guidelines , Gift taxes , Wealth management , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

ABLE Accounts: An Option for Families with Disabled Children,"On Dec 16, 2014, Congress passed the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2013 (ABLE Act) with the strong backing of both political parties and dozens of nonprofit organizations supporting programs for the disabled. The ABLE Act allows an individual, starting in 2015, to establish an ABLE account if they have a disability that started before age 26. ABLE accounts offer tax benefits and the opportunity to stretch the available resource threshold to $100,000, but special needs trusts can be much more beneficial. Third parties, such as parents or grandparents, can create an irrevocable trust for a special needs dependent. In conclusion, ABLE accounts are an option for financial advisers to consider when working with families trying to save for a disabled child's future. Used in conjunction with other tools, ABLE accounts provide a way to save money for a disabled child without interfering with federal and state benefits.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CFP, CPA;Daff, Leslie, JD", Feature,Feb,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Federal legislation , Disabled people , Financial planners , Trusts , Dependents , Families & family life , Disabled children , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Which Firms Lose More Value in Stock Market Crashes?,"The 1987 and 2008 stock market crashes were the two most significant market declines in US history since the Great Depression. The S&amp;P 500 lost 28.5% of its value, and the NASDAQ lost 24.6% of its value in the 1987 crash. The S&amp;P 500 lost 23.7% of its value, and the NASDAQ lost 24.8% of its value in the 2008 crash. This study uses multivariate analysis of variance and logistic regression analysis statistical techniques to identify the financial characteristics of the firms that lost the most value in the 1987 and 2008 stock market crashes. Results show that beta is a reliable predictor of loss in stock market crashes and that firms with a high financial leverage tend to lose more value in major stock crashes. This study finds that investors who select stocks, stock portfolios, mutual funds, and ETFs with a high beta or stock in firms with a high financial leverage are likely to lose more than average value in a major stock market crash.","Uygur, Ozge, PhD;Meric, Gulser, PhD;Meric, Ilhan, PhD", Feature,Feb,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Great Depression , Multivariate analysis , Regression analysis , Studies , Stock market crashes , Financial leverage , Beta , Securities markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Are Profit Margins Too Generous, or AUM Firms Not Profitable Enough to Survive?","While early adopters of the assets under management (AUM) model appeared in the 1980s or early 1990s, the model became widely adopted in the early 2000s. And with an average profit margin of about 22%, the typical advisory firm owner with an AUM practice is enjoying record take-home pay. Yet, as advisory firms on the AUM model have grown, their growth rates seem to be slowing. While many have criticized profit margins as being unjustly rich and generous, and therefore prone to disruption, for many advisory firms, the profit margins may not be large enough to withstand the next bear market. At best, most firms will likely find the next bear market to be the most traumatic ever as a firm owner, simply given the sheer operational leverage of today's typical advisory firm. Firms that don't have the profit margins nor the growth potential may not survive.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Feature,Feb,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Bear markets , Investment companies , Profit margins , Asset management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Advisers who want to thrive in this new environment will have to do one of two things: find a way to offer truly differentiated investment management, with high-conviction alpha strategies that are not accessible in a robo-adviser framework; or leverage the new tools available from robo-advisers to scale their business while focusing on the areas where they can make a real difference.","Hougan, Matt", Commentary,Feb,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment advisors , Strategic planning , Bank automation , Business models , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

A lot of firms do have certain procedures detailed out, but typically the procedures they have aren't really idealized to flow in the way the procedure is intended to. Many times the problem is how workflows have been constructed and thought through. If the operational and workflow foundation is not in place, it's going to be impossible to evolve to the extent that most firms want to. Additionally, programming the workflows in the firm's CRM workflow engine is really important. The CRM should be the hub of the practice from which all activities emanate and should also integrate with the other software applications the firm is using.","Schulaka, Carly", Interview,Jan,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Workflow software , Customer relationship management , Work methods improvement , United States--US , Fox, Deborah",ProQuest One Academic

Emerging Market Bond ETFs Diversify a Fixed-Income Portfolio,"Though slightly more volatile due to their association with developing economies, emerging market bond ETFs can help enhance yield generation for a fixed-income portfolio and diversify exposure into potentially under-allocated foreign markets.

Furthermore, emerging market debt is vulnerable to inflationary pressures, but many emerging central banks and governments adhere to stringent policies to monitor inflation.

Understanding New IRS Rules for Longevity Insurance,"Longevity insurance is a deferred immediate annuity contract used to hedge against the risk of outliving one's resources. On Jul 1, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) adopted final regulations concerning longevity insurance. The final regulations incorporate several suggestions from practitioners to provide more flexibility to individuals who wish to incorporate longevity insurance into their retirement portfolios. Under the final regulations adopted by the IRS, the value of a qualified longevity annuity contract (QLAC) is excluded from the account balance of a taxpayer when determining required minimum distribution amounts. The final regulations permit QLACs to include return of premium features as well. Consequently, individuals who have concerns about extended life and the possibility of running out of money during retirement can now use longevity insurance, with the IRS's blessing, bringing more certainty to their retirement income projections, and more peace of mind to themselves and their families.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA", Feature,Jan,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Government agencies , Life insurance , Tax regulations , Retirement planning , Insurance premiums , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"I, Robo-Adviser? Creating the Blended Adviser Experience","Much has been written about the surge of the ""robo-adviser"" and the impending doom it signals for the traditional financial adviser business model. Although an active-versus-passive argument isn't the focus of this article, investments have some important undertones in the robo-adviser surge. Aside from the myriad of investment return-based studies, other industry trends have contributed to the rise of online advisory platforms. These facts and trends tell the industry that investment management is ripe to be commoditized. The good news is that many successful advisers are already doing it: offering financial planning and guidance/advice to clients. Perhaps in terms of offering the commoditized services, advisers will need to take a page from the robo-advisers' book, leveraging investment management technologies in order to help scale the process. And although the pure robo-advisers will certainly have a place for some clients, the future for business and technology-savvy financial advisers is brighter than ever.","Tedesco, Darren", Feature,Jan,2015,Journal of Financial Planning," Technology adoption , Computer platforms , Trends , Investment advisors , Client relationships , Business models",ProQuest One Academic

Playing the Long Game to Achieve a Uniform Fiduciary Standard,"The question of whether to impose a fiduciary duty on brokers who give advice to retail customers has bedeviled Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for years. As the book closes on 2014, one might complain that another year has passed with no resolution on a uniform fiduciary standard. Four years after the passage of Dodd-Frank, the SEC appears no closer to a verdict now than in the immediate aftermath of the law's passage. The SEC staff completed its study in January 2011, recommending that the Commission adopt a uniform fiduciary standard, but the Commission has not yet acted. One reason the uniform fiduciary issue is challenging is because the merged title of broker-dealer obscures the difference in the roles and responsibilities of brokers and dealers. Movement toward a uniform fiduciary standard has been indisputable but the biggest challenges lie ahead. The primary goal is no longer seeking agreement that a fiduciary standard is desirable; that has largely occurred, although dissenters still exist.","Laby, Arthur B, JD", Feature,Dec,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Standards , Regulatory agencies , Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act 2010-US , Fiduciary responsibility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

As a result, 2014 brought with it the approval of the Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (UFADAA or ""the Act"" or ""Uniform Act"") by the Uniform Law Commission (ULC). The authors also saw the first state -- Delaware -- pass the Act. It is important to note that the UFADAA is not a free-standing, self-contained body of law. It overlays existing federal privacy laws and contains carve-outs based on other state-specific laws and definitions that may be in existence now or be enacted in the future.","Bissett, William, CFP;Blair, Andrew W, JD, CPA", Feature,Dec,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Digital asset management , Financial planning , Federal legislation , Fiduciaries , Estate administration , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Stop Impressing, and Start Relationship Building","The author was going to a regular meeting with a room full of business people, many of whom he knew. When he awoke that morning, he thought about which suit he should wear, which car to drive, and who he could potentially sit by. He suddenly realized that he was watching himself be himself instead of just experiencing the present moment. He was thinking about this as it relates to their business, their transition planning, and his client interactions. When he makes himself or someone else an object -- president of the company, a prospect, an employee -- rather than a fellow human being, he loses the opportunity of a real connection. He essentially gives himself up in order to gain something that may not be authentic to who he is. When he is concerned about being open with someone, it comes from what he is afraid he may lose.","Levin, Ross, CFP", Feature,Dec,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Meetings , Customer relationship management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Now, with the help of new tools and services, any financial adviser can create a low-cost online portfolio management solution and be a ""robo-adviser."" Robo-advisers provide automated online portfolio management services with little-to-no human assistance. The tools mimic the portfolio management processes widely used by human advisers, including risk assessment, asset allocation, security selection, account opening, asset transfer, implementation, reporting, cash management, rebalancing, and billing.

Policy-Based Financial Planning as Decision Architecture,"When working to help clients achieve positive changes in their lives, financial planners must grapple with the embedded heuristics and cognitive biases held by their clients that have been well documented since Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky published their groundbreaking work, ""A Heuristic for Judging Frequency and Probability,"" in the early 1970s. Since then, psychologists and economists have continued to help deepen the planning profession's understanding of the two cognitive systems that people use for interacting with the world. The automatic system of decision-making evolved because it helped people make rapid decisions in situations where there was high survival value need. Although cognitive biases can lead to poor decision-making, Thaler and Sunstein (2008) have suggested that cognitive biases might be harnessed in ways that ""nudge"" individuals in the direction of better decision-making. Policy-based financial planning provides a methodology for dealing with, and even harnessing, heuristics and cognitive biases.","Yeske, Dave, DBA, CFP;Buie, Elissa, CFP", Feature,Dec,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Heuristic , Decision making , Cognition & reasoning , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Taking a Closer Look at Deferred Income Annuities,"Deferred income annuities (DIA), which generally are designed as single-premium income annuities with payments beginning after at least one year, have long appealed to the sensibilities of academics. DIAs are also known as longevity insurance for cases such as a when a 65 year old purchases a DIA contract with income to begin at age 80 or 85. It has only been in the past few years that DIA sales have grown sufficiently for anyone outside of the ivory tower to pay much attention. With a recent ruling from the Treasury Department on qualified longevity annuity contracts (QLAC) regarding the ability to defer taxation triggered by RMDs until age 85, you can expect to start hearing much more about DIAs. The author will explain some of the advantages and disadvantages of DIAs as well as how they might fit into a retirement income strategy.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Dec,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Advantages , Disadvantages , Retirement , Deferred income , Annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How Lead Advisers Can Help the Next Generation Succeed,"It's no secret that the financial advisory industry, which has been largely set up to help people save and plan for their retirement and future, is aging rapidly; more than 50% of advisers today may be looking at their own retirement soon. For those who have built a successful practice, the question of what to do next looms large. Succession planning can involve anything from selling client assets, to merging with an acquiring firm, to hiring a successor. Many advisers want their legacy to live on and are bringing in new talent long before their own retirement to cultivate young professionals who will be able to manage the business at some point. Developing next generation leaders takes three things: focus, clarity, and consistency. If you seek to have trained and satisfied next gen staff , throwing them into a role and expecting them to figure it out, because that's what the older generation did, is not going to achieve the results you may need.","Flaxington, Beverly D", Feature,Dec,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Best practice , Succession planning , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Making the Online Estate Planning Process Work,"Although non-attorney document service providers such as LegalZoom.com have been online for years, estate planning attorneys are only now making meaningful inroads on the Internet. Off-the-shelf computer programs such as Quicken Family Lawyer provide forms, and non-attorney document service providers check customer input for spelling errors, but neither of these approaches do -- or can -- provide legal advice. As many financial advisers and estate planning attorneys know, do-it-yourself estate planning has resulted in documents that clients do not understand, documents that do not work as intended, and even estate plans that are missing necessary documents. Online estate planning law firms engage the client with a limited services agreement.

Trust: A Factor in Portfolio Composition,"Stock investment requires some understanding of the risk-return trade-off, as well as a certain trust that the data and analysis used to make risk reward assumptions is reliable. Households must achieve a certain level of trust in the market system before they are willing to engage in stock market transactions. From an investment perspective, trust is a person's reliance on the integrity of a future payout or confidence in the certainty of future payment. Trust, within the domain of financial planning and as defined by Yamauchi and Templer (1982), is a lack of hesitancy, suspicion, or doubt regarding situations involving money. Others have noted that trust is composed of at least two different aspects. Affective trust, or the trust that those on the opposite side of a financial transaction are intrinsically motivated, has been shown to be positively associated with future transactions.","Sybrowsky, Jacob P, PhD, CRC, RFC;Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP;Smith, Hyrum, PhD, CFP, CPA", Feature,Dec,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Trust , Studies , Investment , Data analysis , Financial planning , Demographics , Securities markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

You and the Obligation to Put Yourself First,"Success or failure is a direct result of certain actions you choose to demonstrate. Planners must remember that they bring themselves -- their styles and attitudes -- into every relationship, responsibility, and client opportunity. Before you can stand in your client's shoes, you must be comfortable in your own. Before you can establish a trusting relationship, you must be authentic. In order for a client to express a particular need, you have to communicate. Before you can garner confidence in what it is you do, you must clearly define yourself. Putting clients' interests first does not become relevant until you are functioning in a way that establishes trust, confidence, and knowledge. Lead by continuing to put your best self forward for the benefit of your client or prospect. Make it become more than what you say you do, but something that you do every day. You have to come first, otherwise, you have nothing to offer.","Seeber, Catherine M, CFP", Commentary,Nov,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Personal development , Effectiveness , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
A Comparison of Retirement Strategies and Financial Planner Value,"Professional financial planners can help households accurately estimate the amount of retirement income needed to fund household retirement goals. Additionally, a financial planner can provide a financial plan that involves establishing the steps needed to meet a retirement goal and facilitate regular interaction to evaluate progress. A financial planner may also increase a worker's awareness of the consequences of low savings, reduce the psychic costs of making complex choices, and help improve investment performance and tax efficiency within household portfolios. This paper contributes to the literature on the value of financial planners by evaluating the impact of retirement income planning advice on retirement saving. The authors hypothesized that the process of estimating retirement income needs can motivate a household to save more, and that working with a planner can help a client formulate a more realistic estimate of how much they should save and help them maintain a saving plan that results in higher savings rates.","Martin, Terrance K, Jr, PhD;Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP", Feature,Nov,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Retirement planning , Portfolio management , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Benefits and Drawbacks of 401(k) Loans in a Low Interest Rate Environment,"Many 401(k) plans offer participants the option to borrow from their own accounts. Details and restrictions vary across plans, but generally the minimum amount is $1,000 with the maximum amount being the lesser of $50,000 or 50% of the vested account balance. Li and Smith (2008) and Lu and Mitchell (2010) found that liquidity constrained households are more likely to take 401(k) loans. However, Li and Smith (2008) also noted that 401(k) borrowing has been increasing among households that are not liquidity constrained. The main argument against borrowing from a 401(k) is lost investment return. The money borrowed is paid back with a fixed amount of interest rather than a potentially higher return from stock and bond investments. Although the interest rate and the investment return are the most important factors, other variables can dramatically reduce the benefits of 401(k) loans. Origination fees, maintenance fees, size of the loan, and the return on savings are relevant factors that need to be considered.","Johnston, Jarrod, PhD, CFP;Roten, Ivan, PhD, CFP", Feature,Nov,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Interest rates , Loans , Liquidity , Rates of return , Retirement plan loans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Succession Planning: Are You Proactive or Reactive?,"Firms are faced with the flip side of that hard truth -- at some point, their top financial advisers will be retiring. There are two ways to approach this hard truth: by proactively planning, or by reactively scrambling. Reactively scrambling means pushing off the conversations around how to transfer the value that is represented in a retiring adviser's book of business, holding on to the idea that an adviser will never retire. There is a real opportunity in succession planning if you are willing to get proactive. That means reaching out early and often to start conversations around succession. When planning proactively, the focus isn't only on advisers who are already in the process of retiring. Instead, the focus needs to be on seasoned advisers who are starting to or thinking about ""slowing down.""","Flynn, Daniel J", Feature,Nov,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Succession planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
New Perspectives on the Active versus Passive Debate,"In the mutual funds literature, it has become a virtually stylized fact that, on average, mutual funds with greater operating expenses generate lower net-of-expense returns to their shareholders. Such findings have spurred the trend toward low-cost passive investing. The purpose of this month's column is not to advocate one particular portfolio management strategy over another, but rather to suggest some additional ways to think about which strategy to choose. The main point is that the popularity of active strategies varies over time depending on the ferocity of the competition for acquiring information. Moreover, both the popularity of active strategies and the ferocity of the competition for acquiring information vary across investment categories. In each of the FPA Trends in Investing Surveys from 2006 through 2014, mutual funds ranked as the most popular investment vehicle used by financial advisers.

The Changing Risk-Return Characteristics of Value and Growth Investing,"Ever since the decision by Morningstar to classify domestic equity mutual funds into one of nine style categories, financial advisers have often been faced with the task of assessing the risk-return characteristics of these equity styles. Investment advisers are perhaps familiar with the historic evidence that portfolios of small companies tend to have higher long-term average returns but also higher volatility than portfolios of large companies. However, the performance of so-called ""value"" stocks versus ""growth"" stocks is less known and more controversial. The purpose of this paper is to explore in depth the risk-return characteristics of value and growth portfolios. In particular, the authors focus on the possibility of average returns and risk changing over time. By examining the historic behavior of these investing styles, it is possible to obtain a better sense of the magnitude and stability of each style's risk and returns. This, in turn, will help investment advisers better match the investment style to their clients.","Emm, Ekaterina E, PhD;Trevino, Ruben C, PhD", Feature,Nov,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Growth stocks , Mutual funds , Risk management , Investment policy , Rates of return , Value stocks , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"The Future of Client Communication: Drive Engagement, Create Differentiation","For many financial advisers, increased business success creates an uncomfortable gap between their commitment to clients and what those clients actually experience. Great service is a necessary but not sufficient condition of an engaged client relationship. There are four components of an effective communication plan -- it is meaningful, profitable, defined, and communicated. To use client feedback effectively to co-create value, consider asking questions about what is important to clients and what they value. Clients may not be able to tell you what is missing, but an effective survey will help you identify the gaps and act as a prelude to a deeper conversation. The final, and perhaps more fundamental, question when it comes to co-creation involves defining the client. Those advisers who are embracing engagement as one of their key goals have a growing arsenal of tactics at their disposal to create an experience that is meaningful and differentiated.","Littlechild, Julie", Cover Story,Nov,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Communication , Effectiveness , Customer satisfaction , Client relationships , Financial services , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Thankfully, it's not a very hard task. You simply need to ""think different"" when it comes to engaging with clients and prospects. Start paying attention to what your clients appreciate most. Generally speaking, their appreciation preferences will fall into one of the three categories: acknowledgement, time spent, and acts of service. Advisers who simply possess a rock solid investment background or offer a comprehensive financial plan aren't doing enough to compete these days.

Traditional Versus Roth 401(k) Contributions: The Effect of Employer Matches,"Many employees have the opportunity to contribute to 401(k) plans, but this opportunity has become more complicated in recent years as more employers have expanded their plans' options to include Roth 401(k) accounts in addition to traditional 401(k) accounts. Several papers, including Geisler (2006), and Geisler and Stern (2014), have examined the Roth 401(k) versus traditional 401(k) choice. The typical recommendation from these studies has been to contribute to the Roth retirement account if the tax rate during retirement will be higher than the current tax rate, or contribute to the traditional type retirement account if the tax rate will be lower. An important aspect of 401(k) plans is that employers often match part or all of their employees' contributions. This paper analyzes the Roth 401(k) versus traditional 401(k) contribution decision, taking into account employer matching contributions. This paper presents after-tax accumulation models for the two options, shows the break-even point where they are equivalent, and illustrates the models through numerical examples.","Geisler, Greg, PhD;Hulse, David, PhD", Feature,Oct,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Impact analysis , Tax rates , Roth 401k plans , Employers , Retirement planning , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Diversifying with Commodity ETFs,"For an added layer of diversification, investment portfolios can include a broad basket of commodities. However, financial advisers seeking to include a commodity ETF in their lineup must be aware, as these ETFs are not your typical stock fund. From 1970 to 2004, commodities showed a negative correlation to other asset classes like global equities and domestic fixed-income securities. However, the correlation between commodities and the broader stock market did spike after the financial crisis, but it has since diminished, according to Morningstar data. Commodity ETFs and other funds that invest in futures contracts are susceptible to contango, which occurs when the price on a futures contract is higher than the expected future spot price, creating the upward sloping curve on future commodity prices overtime.","Lydon, Tom", Commentary,Oct,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Portfolio diversification , Exchange traded funds , Commodity prices , Commodity futures , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
It Was 20 Years Ago Today,"October 2014 would be the 20th anniversary of Bill Bengen's groundbreaking initial article, ""Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data,"" about his research into sustainable and safe withdrawals in retirement. In the early 1990s, empirical research into sustainable withdrawals during retirement was understandably nonexistent. As late as 1995, stock-picking guru Peter Lynch claimed that a 7% withdrawal rate from an all-stock portfolio was appropriate. The flaw in this early conventional wisdom was assuming that the average annual return and inflation rate mattered more than the sequence of annual results that comprised them. When you read just the opening page of ""Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data,"" from the October 1994 Journal, you quickly note Bengen's imaginative use of scenario planning, his appreciation for the human dimension of advising clients, his connection of past approaches to their real-world flaws, and his sense that objective and data-driven analysis was needed to shed sufficient light on his subject.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®", Cover Story,Oct,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Data analysis , Withdrawals , Retirement plans , United States--US , Bengen, William P",ProQuest One Academic

Standard household economic theory (Becker 1965) posits that individuals consume and derive utility from household produced commodities such as meals, a clean house, and a nice garden. These commodities are produced with goods and services but also with time. Production of a household commodity can be ""goods intensive."" That is, it can utilize more goods and services than time, or ""time intensive,"" utilizing more time than goods and services. Because individuals air consuming commodities rather than goods and services directly, financial planners must consider individuals' time use, as well as their purchases of goods and services, upon retirement. In this study, retirees were defined to be individuals aged 50 and older who reported that they were not in the labor force (not employed and not looking for work) or that they were retired.","Kalenkoski, Charlene M, PhD;Oumtrakool, Eakamon", Feature,Oct,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Studies , Statistical data , Customer satisfaction , Personal income , Retirees , Commodities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Comparatively Speaking,"Progress is, by definition, a very personal issue because progress cannot be measured without first taking inventory of where you are now and where you would like to be in the future. The common dialogue in financial services has mistakenly placed greater emphasis on where you'd like to be than where you are at now to its own detriment. Progress is impossible to gauge without a clear picture of where one is at. It's difficult to deny that this idea of a comparative measure concept is most likely rooted in arrogance. It is not just the common practice of comparative measure that is problematic for the adviser/client relationship. Other mistakes in the ""measure mythology"" include: Predicting the future by looking backward and measuring against broad market patterns instead of specific and unique client needs and wants. Planners would do well to get their clients' minds off industry averages and place the magnifying glass on establishing personal bests in overall financial performance -- spending, saving, protecting, investing, and giving.","Anthony, Mitch", Commentary,Oct,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Progress , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Retirement Planning by Targeting Safe Withdrawal Rates,"Financial advisers frequently find themselves in situations where traditional safe withdrawal rates do not apply. This article provides withdrawal rates for a variety of scenarios from which advisers can select based on the desired probability of success. And a new retirement income planning technique is presented that uses these withdrawal rates, eliminating the need to perform complex Monte Carlo simulations for each client. Three ways to think about safe withdrawal rates: 1. traditional safe withdrawal rates, 2. the target percentage adjustment (TPA), and 3. TPA with 3% maximum. By using lookup tables of safe withdrawal rates, the need to perform complex and cumbersome Monte Carlo simulations is eliminated. This simple technique results in a one-page tabular display that clients can easily understand. Better client understanding results in better client buy in, which in turn results in better client compliance to the retirement plan, more client empowerment, and more overall satisfaction with the financial planning process.","Zolt, David M, CFP®, EA, ASA, MAAA", Feature,Oct,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Withdrawals , Retirement planning , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Are Your Clients Making the Right Loan Choice?,"Borrowing money is not necessarily a bad thing, but the costs of different loan options vary widely. To avoid financially dangerous situations and maximize wealth, it is important that consumers choose the proper borrowing options to finance their needs. One frequently overlooked loan option for the majority of people with defined contribution pension plans is a plan loan (commonly called a 401(k) loan). In this paper, the authors propose a hypothetical debt scenario to analyze and compare the costs of four loan options used to finance general consumption: 1. 401(k) loans, 2. credit card loans, 3. high-cost loans, and 4. home equity lines of credits (HELOC). The scenario analyses show that 401(k) loans, along with HELOCs, are one of the least expensive loan options under reasonable assumptions. This paper concludes by urging financial planners to take a more proactive role in introducing 401(k) loans to clients as a potentially cheaper loan option.","Tang, Ning, PhD;Lu, Timothy, PhD", Feature,Oct,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Comparative analysis , Financial planners , Home equity loans , Loans , Retirement plan loans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Why ETF-Only 401(k) Plans Don't Excite Me,"The author is not a fan of ETF-only 401(k) plans. Far fewer ETFs than mutual funds are available in the marketplace, and many of those are niche products that don't belong in a 401(k). Plus, he does not think employers really want employees trading ETFs during working hours. It's true ETFs in general have lower expenses than mutual funds, but he doesn't buy the argument that ETF-only plans would lower fund expenses if a plan already had low-cost funds in it. The second point is transparency. He's not on board with adding alternative investments to a 401(k) plan. It's not the place for them. That being said, he'd be open to a program that includes ETFs side-by-side with mutual funds in a 401(k), but that's difficult to do because of different settlement dates and trading mechanics.","Ferri, Rick", Commentary,Sep,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Pension fund management , Exchange traded funds , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Matt Oechsli on Delegation, Affluent Marketing, and Becoming an Elite Adviser","In an interview, Matt Oechsli, founder of The Oechsli Institute, talked about the characteristics of elite advisers, the problem with asking for referrals, and how affluent consumers have changed since the Great Recession. Oechsli said if advisers are in a serious growth mode, they have to delegate. To delegate requires staffing, hiring, training, supervision -- all these other dynamics come into the fold. The Great Recession has changed people's purchasing behaviors. The affluent, in regard to their purchasing decisions, have gone back to basics, back to family values. In the financial services bucket, advisers want investment performance to meet expectations, so it's important for advisers to be very clear on the expectations. The adviser of the future are the ones who have retooled their practice so they're absolutely relevant to their clients today. They're the ones who are bringing in new affluent relationships at a quicker pace.

It helps if advisers appreciate that diversification is really just a means to an end, not an end in itself. Its goal is to decrease the risk in a portfolio while still allowing a healthy return. Whichever way portfolio risk is measured, the purpose of diversification is to optimize the risk/return trade-off at the portfolio level -- in both normal and stressed markets -- and the means it uses to do so is mixing together poorly correlated asset classes.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFP, CFA, FCAS, CERA;Goodman, Marina, CFP, CFA", Commentary,Sep,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Risk management , Portfolio diversification , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Value of Bitcoin in Enhancing the Efficiency of an Investor's Portfolio,"Bitcoin is a digital currency devised by a programmer or a group of programmers under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto guided bitcoin's development until 2010. Unlike most virtual currencies, bitcoin can be exchanged for real-life goods and services on a limited basis. This paper attempts to answer the questions how useful bitcoin is as a currency, and what role bitcoin might play in enhancing the efficiency of an investor's portfolio. In an attempt to examine if bitcoin behaves like a currency, the authors examined the distributional properties of its returns along with those of other major currencies and gold. The analysis reveals that, as a currency, bitcoins are in their infancy. Currently, limited acceptability makes bitcoins a poor medium of exchange, while high volatility makes this asset a poor store of value. Given the observations, and the conclusions from the empirical analysis, individual investors can benefit from holding a small amount of bitcoins in a diversified portfolio.","Wu, Chen Y, PhD;Pandey, Vivek K, DBA, CFA, FRM", Cover Story,Sep,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Digital currencies , Currency , Portfolio investments , Risk exposure",ProQuest One Academic
Are You (and Your Beneficiary Designations) up to Date?,"Financial planners typically focus on the most complex issues facing clients, such as determining the asset allocation, constructing the portfolio, calculating appropriate savings levels to meet retirement, educational and major purchase goals, and developing gifting and estate strategies to reduce or eliminate exposure to transfer taxes. Of course, these esoteric aspects of planning provide significant value for the client, but often the simplest actions and advice -- such as making sure that beneficiary designations are up to date -- are most important to a client. Beneficiary designations provide an easy way for a client to transfer wealth, but also pose a danger to the unwary. If circumstances change but the client's beneficiary designation does not, property may be transferred to an unintended recipient.

Is the 4 Percent Rule Too Low or Too High?,"In his October 1994 article for the Journal of Financial Planning, William Bengen brought more rigor to our understanding of sustainable withdrawal rates by demonstrating the role of sequence of returns risk. The sustainable withdrawal rate can fall well below that implied by the average portfolio return over the retirement period, because a market decline early in the retirement period digs a hole that is difficult to overcome. Historically in the US, one could withdraw 4% of his or her retirement date portfolio, adjust this amount for inflation in subsequent years, and sustain withdrawals over 30 years using a diversified portfolio with 50% to 75% stocks. By adding greater realism to the underlying assumptions, one can identify a number of factors suggesting numbers both higher than and lower than 4%.

Life Planning: Creator of Entrepreneurial Endeavor,"Entrepreneurial endeavor is inadequately understood, both in classic economic terms and in life planning. It's the driver of economic and social value in a society. Its delivery is what gives financial planning its value to an adviser and to the consumer.

You might think it is security that delivers financial planning's value, and it certainly has its place, but security (the financial architecture) is best applied last. Entrepreneurship is commonly defined as the process of identifying and starting a new business venture, sourcing and organizing the required resources, while taking both the risks and rewards associated with the venture.

Is a Portfolio Built to Produce Yield a Sensible Retirement Income Portfolio?,"This paper focuses on the efficiency of allowing yield payments to dictate retirement spending, as well as the efficiency of tilting a portfolio away from an ""efficient"" portfolio for the sake of producing more yield. Much of the literature suggests that a total return objective is a better choice than focusing on portfolio yield for retirees. This analysis furthers this literature by revisiting the cash flow and estate objectives of a retiree. Results suggest that: 1. using a yield portfolio forces a tradeoff between retirement spending and estate goals; 2. current yields may not be high enough to meet retirement income needs; 3. yields change over time, leading to inconsistent spending; 4. drawing down an efficient portfolio with the same risk as a portfolio emphasizing yield has higher expected principal accumulation; and 5. drawing down a portfolio is more tax-efficient than using yield to generate retirement income.","Pittman, Sam, PhD", Feature,Aug,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Retirees , Yield , Cash flow , Portfolio management , Retirement income",ProQuest One Academic
Mutual Funds Are Dead: Here's How to Adapt,"Exchange-traded funds (ETF) have been stealing market share from mutual funds for the past decade. With $1.8 trillion in assets under management, ETFs currently have about 11% of all assets invested in the mutual fund space. That number grows by about 1% to 2% a year. ETFs are winning market share because they are inherently cheaper and more tax-efficient than traditional mutual funds. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs almost never pay capital gains distributions, shielding clients from unwanted taxes. For large advisers, fairly parsing out ETF trades that clear on different platforms can be an enormous headache.

Nominal SPIAs, especially those with a 20-year certain payment period, tend to be the most efficient among the eight annuity types considered in this analysis, on average, followed by nominal SPIAs and nominal DIAs. However, if DIA payout rates increase by only 5%, nominal DIAs become the most attractive option, on average. Results suggest DIAs appear to offer significant promise to retirees as an efficient form of guaranteed income, especially given the relatively low cost for the longevity hedge when compared to SPIAs.","Blanchett, David, CFP, CFA", Feature,Aug,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Regression analysis , Deferred income , Retirees , Retirement planning , Annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

After the Initial Enrollment Period ends, a beneficiary may have the chance to sign up for Medicare Parts A and B during a Special Enrollment Period (SEP). Beneficiaries who delay enrollment in Parts A and B and are not eligible for a SEP will be assessed a late enrollment penalty on their Part B premium.

To obtain a better understanding of the investor's qualitative risk profile, it is suggested that advisers attempt to identify if their clients are loss averse, and to what degree. Financial practitioners who take time to understand their clients' complete risk profile (quantitative and qualitative) will be in a better position to recommend investment strategies that are more suitable for who their clients are today, with the goal of improving investor performance and investor experience.","Mooreland, Jay, CFP", Feature,Jul,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Client relationships , Risk assessment , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Generating Income with Dividend ETFs,"Advisers can gain exposure to stable dividends through exchange-traded funds, but it is also important to look under the hood. As the ETF universe continues to expand, the variety of dividend-related investment options have increased. Compared to high-flying growth stocks or small-capitalization companies, dividend-paying companies seem like a boring trade. However, these companies tend to be more mature, providing an investment portfolio with a sense of predictability and stability. Combined with a consistent dividend payout, more established companies can produce stable and solid returns over the long haul. While browsing through the dividend ETFs available on the market, look beyond the yield generated and consider how the fund achieves its goals.","Lydon, Tom", Commentary,Jul,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Dividends , Growth stocks , Exchange traded funds , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Food for Thought on Fiduciary, Fixed Income, Safe Withdrawals","The author shared his thoughts on several papers on fiduciary, fixed income and safe withdrawals. In ""The Fiduciary Obligations of Financial Advisers under the Law of Agency,"" by Robert Sitkoff, although an adviser may not be a fiduciary under federal law, because the state agency fiduciary law is not coterminous with federal law, he or she may be a fiduciary under state law. In ""Low Bond Yields and Efficient Retirement Income Portfolios,"" by David Blanchett, as always, Blanchett provides a contribution well worth reading. The traditional approach of developing simulation models based on long-term historical averages may be less useful when there is a significant and sustained deviation from those historical averages. In ""Strategies for Mitigating the Risk of Outliving Retirement Wealth,"" by Vickie Bajtelsmit, LeAndra Ottem Foster, and Anna Rappaport, a combined strategy of delayed retirement and Social Security claiming, reduced discretionary spending, and LTC insurance is found to greatly improve retirement outcomes for typical retiree households.","Evensky, Harold, CFP, AIF", Commentary,Jul,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Research , Withdrawals , Fiduciaries , Fixed incomes , Retirement , State court decisions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Why Robo-Advisers Are a Problem for the Profession,"The author pointed out that for decades, technological advances have been nothing but helpful to practicing financial planners, and he believed it would remain so. When an objective observer looks at the services provided by a good financial planner and compares that to the offering of a robo-adviser or other low-cost provider, there are substantial differences. The consumer is not getting the same thing at a lower price. They're getting a small portion of the services a good financial planner provides for that lower price. The complexity of personal financial issues and the volume and velocity of information thrown at the public is only intensifying. Being able to make sense of all this within the context of each family's unique attributes is a service that is desperately needed.","Moisand, Dan, CFP", Commentary,Jul,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Quality of service , Value added , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Life Insurance Policy Replacements: Dos and Don'ts,"Policy replacement refers to terminating an existing policy in favor of a new one. It is absolutely mandatory the existing policy remains in place until the new one is in force. If a taxable gain is associated with the existing policy, it should be transferred using Section 1035, which allows for a tax-free exchange. For life insurance agents, policy replacement is the easiest sale. The policyowner doesn't need to decide if they want more life insurance. The agent makes the claim that the new policy will be a better deal, but this isn't always the case. There are three considerations when advising a client about a possible replacement of an existing policy. One is to determine the current health status of the insured and compare it with the underwriting on the existing policy. Another issue is assessing the pricing quality of the existing policy. Even if the existing policy's pricing is excellent, the final replacement element can trump pricing.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Feature,Jul,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Terminations , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Financing a Business Startup or Acquisition Using Rollover Funds,"Financial planners are likely to have clients who are interested in owning their own businesses. Retirement accounts are often the clients only available source of significant funds to finance the startup or purchase. The taxes and penalties resulting from accessing funds in a retirement account can significantly reduce the money available]e for funding. A solution may be Rollovers as Business Startups (ROBS) plans. For clients who can follow the rules in establishing a ROBS and comply with the future reporting requirements and regulations, a ROBS provides an attractive alternative path to financing a new business. An IRS ROBS memorandum, designed to guide PS staff through auditing a ROBS, can serve as a road map for advisers and clients. This paper examines issues raised by the IRS memorandum, explains the steps to setting up a ROBS, and reviews the IRS and DOL operations and compliance aspects governing ROBS.","Hopson, Patricia D, CPA;Hopson, James F, JD, CPA", Feature,Jun,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Financing , Compliance , Reporting requirements , Startups , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Carson has been involved in a couple of succession plans with advisers, and they've always thought they had one, but when you looked to see if it was executable, a lot of times they weren't funded, they weren't documented properly, the valuation was outdated -- it was either way too low or way too high -- and there wasn't anyway for it to really happen. Meanwhile, many advisers are not spending enough on technology, so over the next 12 months one of his favorite sayings is that technology spend will promote you or will expose you. Regarding fee transparency, the industry hasn't done a good job of disclosing where the fees are, where the conflicts are.

Beware the Crystal Ball,"Financial planners have mostly learned not to fall for the question. They realize it the harm we can cause if they are wrong in either direction. As planner and fellow Journal columnist Ross Levin once wrote, the more confidence they have in their forecasts, the more likely they are to be wrong about them. Clearly, there are always more than enough prognosticators ready to share the rationales behind their predictions. At least one widely used provider of financial planning software uses its own assumptions about the future -- returns, inflation, volatility, etc -- as capital market inputs, thereby shifting its results from being historically based. Policies are not new to financial planning. Policy-based approaches to investment management have existed for several decades. In distribution planning, the two areas most powerfully affected when governed by dynamic policies are the portfolios equity allocation and the annual withdrawal amount.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®", Commentary,Jun,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Software , Capital markets , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The research objective was to test whether fluctuations in equity returns influence average risk tolerance scores over time. A strong positive correlation (0.70) between average monthly risk tolerance scores and the S&amp;P 500 was noted. The standard deviation for average monthly risk tolerance scores was relatively low (186%) compared to monthly S&amp;P 500 values (1,727%). Average monthly risk tolerance scores increased as price/earnings ratios increased and decreased as dividend yields increased. Respondents became less risk tolerant as equity valuations became more attractive. Average risk tolerance scores demonstrated little monthly variation despite large swings in equity values during this time period.

Why Investors Need to Understand the Shape of the Compound Growth Curve,"Ask the majority of financial advisers what is the most valuable ally for new investors seeking to maximize growth, and the power of compounding would be it. In fact, the story goes that Albert Einstein labeled compounding as the most powerful force in the universe. Unlike so many other uncertain aspects of our financial lives, compound growth, once put to work, can become a mathematical certainty. Money invested then re-invested over time Will grow and grow at exponential rates. This article attempts to explain why many beginning investors seemingly walk away from adopting a compounding style of investing and therefore lose a valuable opportunity to grow their money. The fact is that compounding of wealth over time follows a very specific mathematical curvature. The shape of this curve provides insight as to why new and specifically young investors often give up on diligently reinvesting and ultimately lose out on compounding's effects.","Parsons, Jeff C, CFP©", Commentary,May,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Reinvestment , Compound interest , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Mutual Fund Redemption Fees Can Benefit Long-Term Investors,"Mutual funds often buy and sell securities for their portfolios to meet the purchase and redemption requests of their shareholders. The ultimate impact of these liquidity-motivated transactions within a mutual fund's portfolio on returns is difficult to gauge. This is because the prices at which securities in the fund's portfolio are transacted at cannot be directly observed by clients. However, the impact of these trading costs is economically meaningful. The purpose of this column is to summarize the practical implications of recent research on investing in funds with short-term redemption fees as a means of controlling exposure to these costs and ultimately improving returns. In summary, the short-term traders in a mutual fund drag down the returns to the long-term investors because the fund must engage in costly liquidations of securities in order to fulfill redemption requests. Alternatively, the fund may hold a large reserve of low-yielding cash to avoid selling securities at ""fire sale"" prices.","Nanigian, David, PhD", Commentary,May,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Fees & charges , Mutual funds , Investment policy , Rates of return , Scandals , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Exploring the Retirement Consumption Puzzle,"Retirement income research and financial planning tools generally assume that retiree expenditures, or consumption, increase annually by inflation during retirement. This assumption is counter to a growing body of empirical research that has noted actual retiree expenditures tend to decrease both upon, and during, retirement. This phenomenon has been named the ""retirement consumption puzzle."" For this paper, government data on consumption was analyzed to understand how retiree consumption actually changes over time. The results of the analysis suggests that although the retiree consumption basket is likely to increase at a rate that is faster than general inflation -- a fact that can largely be attributed to the higher weight to medical expenses for retirees -- actual retiree spending tends to decline in retirement in real terms. This decrease in real consumption averages approximately 1% per year during retirement.

Training like a pro begins with having a winner's mentality -- going into each game knowing that you are there to win. Prospecting is no different. Training your mind using that winner's mentality that ""every no brings me closer to a yes"" is a must. However, this alone wont ensure success -- you must also sharpen your prospecting skills.

There's a Designation for That,"By clouding the universe with an overabundance of certifications, financial planners are making it more difficult to compare themselves with other distinguished professionals. As of 2012, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated there were approximately 759,800 practicing lawyers in the US, compared to 223,400 personal financial advisers. A clear distinction exists between advancing your knowledge with specialties and using designations that have been created chiefly as ""marketing"" designations. Even the less-stringent designations can help advisers to better assist their clients, if only in specific capacities. The financial planning profession continues to evolve. This is especially true given the demand for an increase in financial service regulation. To date, it is still unclear what changes they can expect.

"Larry Kudlow on Advice for Janet Yellen, Tax Reform, and Being Bullish","In an interview, Larry Kudlow, economist, TV and radio host, and journalist, shared advice for new Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and his thoughts on tax reform and being bullish. On handing over the reins to Janet Yellen, he suggested unwinding QE3. In fact, unwind all the QEs; unwind the Fed's balance sheet. It's too big; $4 trillion is way too big. They were involved in too many markets. He thinks profits will continue to rise by something of an order of magnitude of 10% in 2014 and probably 2015. So, he's bullish, but somewhat more cautious, and that would be his advice for financial planners. He's all for abolishing the entire corporate tax; he thinks it would be a great boon to economic growth and jobs. Income tax now with Obamacare and all the rest is over 40%. It shouldn't be a dime over 20, and probably should be close to 15.","Schulaka, Carly", Interview,Apr,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Fiscal policy , Economic impact , Corporate taxes , Economists , Investment policy , Tax reform , Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act 2010-US , United States--US , Kudlow, Lawrence A",ProQuest One Academic
Devise a Client Communication System that Inspires Loyalty,"The most rewarding dynamic of a financial advisory practice is often the relationships with your clients. To move beyond simply retaining clients, you must inspire client loyalty that solidifies life-long engagements. Relationship marketing -- the critical strategy that addresses an individual's stage of interaction with you and makes them feel wanted -- cannot stop once prospects become clients. To build loyalty you must drive the relationship, proactively create a series of individual communication touches that ensure consistent and personal attention. A well-designed system will streamline your business resources to save you time, money, energy, and your sanity. Here's how to systematize your communications, whether or not you use technology to help you: 1. Outline the client's first year. 2. Structure your system. 3.

Beneficiaries Misbehavin': Legal Developments in Undue Influence,"A summary of four legal trends related to undue influence and will and trust contests is presented. The California decision in Beckwith v. Dahl represents the first time California recognized the tort of intentional interference with expected inheritance, although the tort is recognized in numerous other states. In trust and estate law, the almost universal ""slayer rule"" prohibits inheritance by a person who murders someone from whom he or she will inherit. If the decedent marries the caregiver, elder abuse and undue influence arguments still apply. Harmed beneficiaries who want to bring legal action to reclaim their inheritances may face no-contest or mandatory arbitration clauses in the decedent's will or trust. According to psychologist Ira Turkat, PhD, author of the article ""Psychological Aspects of Undue Influence"" numerous factors commonly seen in the elderly increase their susceptibility to manipulation. Steps to be taken to avoid the appearance of wrongdoing depend on whether you work with a favored beneficiary or a harmed beneficiary.","Garner, Randy, JD, LLM, CFP, CPA;Daff, Leslie, JD", Feature,Apr,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Adult abuse & neglect , Influence , Manipulation , Litigation , Wills , Beneficiaries , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Lifetime Expected Income Breakeven Comparison between SPIAs and Managed Portfolios,"Retirees have a choice between fully managing their retirement assets, partially annuitizing, and fully annuitizing. Single premium immediate annuities (SPIA) provide protection against market downturns and above-average longevity; however, these products may not provide inflation protection, and their use often removes the potential for an end-of-life bequest. Managed portfolios provide less certainty about returns but more opportunity for growth and legacy planning. Clients and their advisers often ask how they should choose between the two options. This paper seeks to address this issue by determining breakeven asset allocations below which SPIAs provide higher lifetime expected total cash flows. The analysis described shows how a client's age is related to the decision. The analysis also shows that other factors impact the choice, including cash flow needs, market returns, and fees. A Monte Carlo model was developed to track cash flow and portfolio balances by age and allocation. This paper is an analytical approach to evaluating the choice a retiree faces.","Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP;Mitchell, John B, DBA;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Apr,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Comparative analysis , Single premium annuities , Breakeven analysis , Monte Carlo simulation , Asset allocation , Cash flow , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Practical and Potentially Perilous Pitfalls of Portability,"A little more than one year ago, the US Treasury Department issued temporary regulations governing the provisions dealing with ""portability"" under Internal Revenue Code Section §2010(c). Taxpayers awoke on Jan 1, 2013 to discover that a vast array of tax provisions had been agreed to on a bipartisan basis by Congress; among these provisions was an increase in the applicable exemption amount to $5.25 million for gifts made and decedents dying after Dec 31, 2012. In addition, the concept of portability was resurrected and made a permanent provision of the Internal Revenue Code, all as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA 2012). Given the surprising turn of events affecting estate planning reform under ATRA 2012, the temporary regulations governing portability are now worth of a much closer took. In summary the permanence of portabiity legislation under ATRA 2012 can be of significant benefit to many married taxpayers.","Sages, Ronald A, PhD, AEP, CFP, CTFA;Seay, Martin C, PhD, CFP", Feature,Apr,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Temporary tax regulations , Relief provisions , Estate taxes , Provisions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Of course, CE can be improved if done right. Well, the good news is it appears CFP Board is reassessing what to do with CE.

Why Municipal Bond ETFs Make More Sense than Ever,"Municipal bonds are an important part of a diversified fixed-income portfolio, providing a yield advantage over US Treasuries. While munis have weakened on interest-rate risk and troubles in cities like Detroit, advisers can use municipal bond exchange-traded funds (ETF) for targeted exposure to the space. Advisers can best use these muni ETFs in a taxable account for investors in high tax brackets to help diversify a fixed-income portfolio. If rising rates start to threaten fixed-income assets again, the higher yields in munis will help cushion the fall in prices. Nevertheless, advisers who are still wary about rising interest rates can consider moving down to short-term debt.","Lydon, Tom", Feature,Apr,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Financial planning , Municipal bonds , Investment policy , Exchange traded funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
2 Schools of Thought on Retirement Income,"Two opposing schools of thought coexist with regard to retirement, with advocates of each often talking past one another with opposite answers for basic and fundamental client questions. As theories about retirement income planning continue to develop, it is important that those working with clients have a basic understanding of both viewpoints, so they can speak on the same wavelength as their clients and prospective clients. The two schools are probability-based and safety-first. The probability-based school of thought's key perspectives on managing risks for a successful retirement include portfolio diversification as it relates to modern portfolio theory, and precautionary savings as connected to the idea of saving enough to meet goals with a conservative withdrawal strategy over a long planning horizon. The key argument for the safety-first school is that risk management for retirement must extend beyond diversification and precautionary saving to also encompass hedging and insurance.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Apr,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Income , Risk management , Investment policy , Retirement planning , Schools , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Understanding Proposed Legislation for Digital Assets,"It is easy to recognize that financial assets pass according to the estate plans for the clients. However, the concept of digital assets and how they pass remains elusive to most financial planners. This has resulted in fiduciaries of estates with little-to-no legal authority or guidance on identifying, collecting, distributing, and settling a decedent's digital estate assets. Fortunately, over the last two and a half years, a group of attorneys and legal experts have been working on a solution called the Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (FADAA). The primary purpose of FADAA will be to vest fiduciaries with the power to access, manage, distribute, copy, or delete digital assets and accounts, according to the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law's draft of the act. The act vests four types of fiduciaries with these powers: executors/personal representatives of an estate, conservators for protected persons, agents serving under a power of attorney, and trustees.","Bissett, William, CFP;Kauffman, David, JD, CFP", Feature,Apr,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Federal legislation , Estate assets , Electronic commerce , Fiduciaries , Asset management , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How to Protect and Help: Clients with Diminished Capacity,"The growth of the older adult population in America is presenting great opportunity and great challenges to the financial planning profession.

Financial planners can take four major steps to better serve vulnerable older adults: 1. Better recognize neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. 2. Understand the basic tenets of decisional abilities for a financial judgment or decision. 3. Create a relationship with a geriatric health care expert and an expert in financial capacity. 4.

IRS Gives Widow(er)s Second Chance at Portability,"The potential for portability of a deceased spouse's unused exemption amount (DSUEA) to a surviving spouse was a significant change that emerged from the fiscal cliff legislation in 2010. However, early adoption of portability was limited, both because of a lack of awareness of the rule by many of those who needed it, and the fact that the portability rules were originally temporary. To provide relief for this unfortunate situation, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2014-18 on January 27, creating a new opportunity for executors to go back for any decedent who died in 2011, 2012, or 2013, and have an extension to file an estate tax return to claim portability of a decedent's estate tax exemption for the surviving spouse. However, the relief provision reopening portability for anyone who died in the past three years is itself temporary; the Form 706 estate tax return must be filed by the end of 2014, or the window will once again be closed for good.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Feature,Apr,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Relief provisions , Tax returns , Social security , Estate taxes , Tax exemptions , Death benefits , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Financial Planning for the Middle Market,"According to Meredith (2012), the middle market generally includes clients with net worth ranging from $100,000 to $1 million in investable assets.

The size of the middle market is large and includes many baby boomers who axe at or near retirement. However, because the average amount of investable assets of middle market clients is moderate, these clients are often overlooked and underserved. This study had three specific objectives. The first was to identify the characteristics of financial planners who work with the middle market. The second was to examine the barriers that planners face when serving middle market clients. Specifically, the study explored the specific issues related to compensation structure, information asymmetry, and planning for clients within this category.

Achieving Higher Growth with Multidisciplinary Teams,"Across industries, the natural product development evolution is from single-purpose products to bundled/packaged products. Bundling is taking hold within the financial and wealth management industry in the form of multidisciplinary teams (MDT).

In the MDT model, the client's circumstances, needs, anxieties, and aspirations remain the center of attention, but built around this are two portfolios. The first is a portfolio of solution tools, and the second is a portfolio of specialists. In an MDT model, each tool is executed knowing the elements of the other tools.

Analyzing the Value of Life Insurance as an Investment,"One of the more challenging aspects of advising clients about life insurance is helping them to recognize that life insurance is an asset, rather than an expense. For many people, this view is a bit of a foreign concept in a world where other types of insurance merely reimburse the policyholder for a contemporaneous, out-of-pocket, economic loss that the policyholder hoped would never occur -- leaving the policyholder in the same economic position as he or she was in before the loss took place. Life insurance is unique in the sense that it covers a loss that is certain to eventually occur. As long as the policy is maintained, the stream of premium payments will ultimately result in the policyholder's receipt of the death benefit -- and this allows for a rate-of-return calculation that is inapplicable to other types of insurance coverage.","Smith, Jordan H, JD, LLM", Cover Story,Mar,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Guidelines , Life insurance , Rates of return , Policyholders , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Recent Changes in the Gains from Delaying Social Security,"Social Security retirement benefits can be claimed at any age between 62 and 70, with delayed claiming resulting in larger monthly payments. Claiming Social Security benefits later generally increases the present value of lifetime benefits for most individuals. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, a number of policy changes increased the gains from delay, particularly for couples. In addition, mortality improved and real interest rates fell considerably over this period, further increasing the attractiveness of delay. For the purposes of this study, simulations to examine the role of these factors in changing the gains from delay were performed. Findings suggest that the gains from delay increased substantially after 2000, with changes in the interest rate playing the largest role in driving the increase.","Shoven, John B, PhD;Slavov, Sita Nataraj, PhD", Feature,Mar,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Socioeconomic factors , Impact analysis , Gains , Social security , Retirement planning , Retirement benefits , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Prudent Savings for Lifetime Consumption,"The purpose of this study is to determine the prudent savings rate necessary to maintain real working-year expenditure levels through 30 years of retirement. Results indicate that retirement plans that require a minimum savings rate necessary to accumulate 12.5 times a clients final real annual income, and the maximum sustainable withdrawal rate necessary to live off this amount through retirement, are associated with greater unnecessary sacrifice during working and retirement years. An alternative built on the lifecycle-based minimum savings rate necessary to maintain real income or real expenditure levels through retirement appears to provide a better solution. Savings plans designed to maintain real income levels during retirement increase real living expenditure levels over those experienced during working years because part of the working income was invested, not consumed.

The common law of agency imposes fiduciary duties of loyalty, care, and a host of subsidiary rules that reinforce and give meaning to loyalty and care as applied to specific circumstances. This paper considers how the fiduciary duties of state agency law might be applied to a financial adviser with discretionary trading authority over a client's account.

A Proper Apology,"Mistakes are inevitable in any field of human services. By ""mistake"" the authors mean an unintentional event that may have meaningful adverse consequences for the financial adviser and/or the client. Account transfer errors, an adviser's failure to implement a planned tax or insurance action, or investment trading errors that result in a client suffering financial loss are some examples. The questions advisers must address in the aftermath of a mistake are central to the advising relationship. There are ways to be proactive, ethical, empathic, and responsive in the aftermath of a mistake, to deliver what they consider ""a proper apology."" The solution is for the adviser to keep his or her emotions in check, engage in active listening, and employ good interviewing techniques using open ended questions and clarifying questions. Some suggested goals for consideration are: 1. Create a culture that supports and reinforces telling the truth at all times. 2. If sanctions are necessary, apply them fairly. 3.

Inquiries and Resolutions,"The 1980s planning-by-the-pound soon led to ""single-issue"" planning that overtly eschewed a comprehensive approach. Some who saw 1980s-style financial planning as lacking in intellectual heft concluded in the 1990s that professionalism demanded the use of certain analytical methodologies; others even moved away from calling their work ""financial planning,"" while still others responded that it was a client's relationship with money that formed the core of their work. Each of these contributed to financial planning's evolution. And, true to Newton's third law of motion, for every action there did seem to be a rather equal and opposite reaction. The profession's response has been its move toward a more policy-based approach to advice-giving; that is, policies founded on empirical research, often conducted with software that had to be built or designed to test the hypothesis in question.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®", Feature,Feb,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Professionals , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Successful Estate Planning for Blended Families,"A blended family brings together children, assets, and frequently different family values and cultures. In essence, estate planning for blended families is difficult. The unique interests of a new spouse and children often create conflict with a parent's aspirations to provide fairly for children from a previous relationship, resulting in unforeseen challenges, misunderstandings, and irreparable damage to the blended family unit. Obtain knowledge of the blended family's distinct needs by using a comprehensive estate planning checklist, supplemented by in-depth interviews early in the process. Determine priorities and wishes to optimally facilitate your planning. Be sure to engage appropriate legal counsel before you pursue any financial or legal strategy to assist blended families. Guide remarrying couples in identifying an unrelated trustee, a fiduciary who has intimate knowledge of the blended family's dynamics and is flexible to the evolving needs of the trusts. Fully acquaint yourself with the issues and concerns common to blended families to optimally provide for each spouse and protect the interests of their respective children.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP®, CTFA, AEP®", Feature,Feb,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Stepfamilies , Remarriage , Guidelines , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Faster Detection of Trend Changes in Slow-Timing the Market,"This paper presents a ""market slow-timing"" portfolio allocation strategy based on anticipation of the market generally moving up or down over intermediate-duration periods. This approach differs from other ""market timing"" practices. Market slow-timing is based on bullish and bearish stock-market statistical trends as described by Cohen (2011a). The approach uses the historical monthly closing values of the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Consumer Price Index, starting in 1901. Since 1901, 24 bullish-to-bearish and 24 bearish-to-bullish transitions have occurred between trends ranging in duration from seven to 114 months. Projected results from an example application, using an in-house financial planning model, reflect the advantage of appropriate allocations earlier during new trends using a new detection method. Depending on the criterion, median results showed increases in average annual yield of invested assets from 5.3% for a conventional approach, to between 5.5% and 6.3% for the described approach.","Cohen, D Allen, PhD;Cliffer, Kenneth D, PhD", Feature,Feb,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Indexes , Asset allocation , Market timing , Trends",ProQuest One Academic

"Sorry Virginia, There Is No Financial Planning Regulator","While you're reading this well into the first quarter of 2014, the author is actually writing it in the glow of Thanksgiving 2013, anticipating a very merry Christmas season. Financial planning is not yet a legally recognized profession, licensed by the various states, and regulated by licensing boards established by the state legislatures. No matter how badly some of you wish otherwise, the existence of a financial planning profession remains a passionate figment of your well-intended imaginations. In his opinion, the CFP Board has been, and continues to be, the most misunderstood organization within the world of financial planning, due to a failure of its own certificants to understand these dual challenges and motives. Until CFP Board devises and adopts a disciplinary model more like the various state medical boards or boards of accountancy, rather than FINRA or other transactional bodies, it will find regulation of financial planning across this vast country to be a formidable challenge.","Adkins, Rick, CFP®, ChFC®, CLU®", Feature,Feb,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Regulation , Financial planning , Licensing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Natalie Choate on RMDs, Smart Tax Strategies, and Prohibited Transactions","In an interview, Natalie B. Choate, an expert in tax and estate planning for retirement benefits, talked about required minimum distributions, smart tax strategies, and prohibited transactions. The three mistakes people make most frequently are the bread-and-butter fundamentals. The first is failure to take a required minimum distribution. The second is failure to name a beneficiary for their IRA or other retirement plan, and the third is rollover mistakes. And this is where having a financial planner is going to make all the difference to make sure these things get done right. The big possibility is if you have employer stock in your retirement plan, you potentially get a special deal that the rest of you don't get, and that is a lump sum distribution of your retirement plan.

Expense Ratios Don't Matter (That Much) in ETFs,"According to a study by Charles Schwab, expense ratios are the No. 1 factor investors consider when deciding which ETFs to buy. The study is self-serving; nonetheless, the author thinks it's true. Expense ratios do matter, but in the grand scheme of things -- particularly as you look at non-standard ETFs -- they matter a lot less than you think. The problem with expense ratios is that they only tell part of the story. Actively managed ETFs aside, the goal of most ETFs is to track an index. Expense ratios are still important. But at least in sticky areas like emerging markets -- particularly with more sophisticated strategies -- tracking difference is a much more important statistic.","Hougan, Matt", Commentary,Feb,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Investors , Fees & charges , Emerging markets , Exchange traded funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Suitability Versus Fiduciary Standard,"As the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to examine the possible implementation of a uniform fiduciary standard, investment professionals who operate under suitability guidelines may be wondering how changing to a fiduciary model may impact their business and their client relationships. In an attempt to answer that question -- as well as questions about differences in the advice and products registered representatives and investment advisers offer -- the authors surveyed a national sample of nearly 400 investment professionals. The results of that survey shed new light on the potential benefits to consumers of a uniform fiduciary standard and highlight the perceived impacts of changing one's standard of care. Fiduciary responsibility has been defined as the minimum obligation that professionals should have toward their clients; it's believed to be part of the contract of engagement between two parties. Most investment advisers reported meeting with new clients an average of two or more times before recommending an investment, compared with 35% of registered representatives.","Goetz, Joseph W, PhD, AFC, CRC®;Chatterjee, Swarn, PhD, CRC®;Cude, Brenda J, PhD", Feature,Feb,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Polls & surveys , Investment advisors , Client relationships , Fiduciary responsibility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

What Do We (Really) Know About U.S. Small-Cap Investing?,"Since the seminal paper of Banz (1981) on the size effect, there has been considerable academic research and practitioner interest in investing in US small capitalization stocks. This paper summarizes what the academic literature has to say about investing in US small-cap stocks and also reviews the available index data on the issue of small- versus large-cap performance. Small-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks on an absolute basis in the US over the period 1926-2012. There is evidence that the absolute outperformance has been weaker in the period since 1981. Findings show that the size effect has been concentrated in the month of January and that small-cap stocks are riskier than large-cap stocks. There is economic logic to suggest the small-cap outperformance evidences a risk premium. Small value has outperformed small growth stocks on an absolute basis. This paper demonstrates that overweighting small-cap and small-cap value stocks can improve the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio.","McDermott, John B, PhD;D'Auria, Dana, CFA", Feature,Jan,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Growth stocks , Small cap investments , Capitalization , Value stocks , Large cap investments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Reducing Retirement Risk with a Rising Equity Glide Path,"This study explores the issue of what is an appropriate default equity glide path for client portfolios during the retirement phase of the lifecycle. Results show, surprisingly, that rising equity glide paths in retirement -- where the portfolio starts out conservative and becomes more aggressive through the retirement time horizon -- have the potential to actually reduce both the probability of failure and the magnitude of failure for client portfolios. Overall, the results show that rising equity glide paths from conservative starting points can achieve superior results, even with tower average lifetime equity exposure. For instance, a portfolio that starts at 30% in equities and finishes at 60% performs better than a portfolio that starts and finishes at 60% equities. A steady or rising glide path provides superior results compared to starting at 60% equities and declining to 30% over time.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA;Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Feature,Jan,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement , Risk , Studies , Probability , Sustainability , Financial planners , Equity , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Protect Your Global Equity from Devaluating Currencies,"International equity exposure helps diversify portfolios away from home country bias, but many advisers are finding currency fluctuations adversely affect returns. Currency-hedged ETFs are a solution to that problem. Advisers must take into account the targeted foreign market conditions and potential changes in the foreign exchange market. Generally, a foreign investment will benefit from an appreciating local currency, however, a weaker local currency means the foreign investment is worth fewer US dollars. With ETFs, financial advisers who are interested in diversifying into overseas equities can take control of foreign currency risk. Investors don't have to worry about the negativity associated with a weak currency. Instead, a currency-hedged equity ETF takes the Forex out of the equation and allows advisers to focus on foreign market returns.","Lydon, Tom", Commentary,Jan,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk , Currency , Portfolio diversification , Exchange traded funds , Foreign exchange markets , Foreign investment , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Ace in the Hole,"Considering recent events, it would be easy to think that sensible regulatory reform for financial planning may never happen. Some of the most ardent supporters of the profession have expressed extreme frustration, even hopelessness. The author's message today is simply don't let these things keep you from doing what you can to advance the profession. You have an ace in the hole. And you will need it. The US House of Representatives passed HR 2374, the laughably named ""Retail Investor Protection Act,"" which simultaneously called for the Department of Labor to wait for the SEC to come out with a fiduciary rule first, while also imposing new requirements on the SEC making it very difficult for the SEC to come out with a rule at all. The ace is the community of financial planning professionals. The more commercial interests mislead the public, the more they seek to confuse, the more they rely on fine print, the more they work to make it harder for the public to see who is who, the more valuable the true planning professional becomes.","Moisand, Dan, CFP", Commentary,Jan,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Regulatory reform , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

In this column, they review the requirements that proposed regulations are likely to impose and suggest how advisers may wish to incorporate this approach to retirement planning for clients. Longevity insurance typically is structured as a single premium deferred annuity with a specified future start date for payments. In February 2012, the IRS proposed regulations that would permit taxpayers to purchase longevity insurance inside of retirement accounts. To qualify for the special benefits allowed under the proposed regulations, a qualified longevity annuity contract -- an annuity contract that meets distribution requirements, premium limitations, and design limitations -- must be purchased. Prior to the publication of these proposed regulations, longevity insurance already was growing in popularity in the planning community.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA", Feature,Jan,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Regulation , Insurance contracts , Annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Results show that for realistic scenarios where investors plan for retirement, HIFO accounting can add between 0.5% and 1.0% to the investors total wealth at the retirement date under typical tax rates. Above-average tax rates and greater returns increase the possible value of using HIFO accounting. Similarly, portfolios that are not completely liquidated, such as those that receive a stepped up basis in an estate, may also have greater HIFO benefits but not likely greater than 2% of the value of the portfolio.","Atra, Robert J, PhD, CFA;Pae, Yuntaek, PhD, CFA", Feature,Jan,2014,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Retirement , Tax rates , Tax basis , Accounting , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Conflict Management for Advisers: How to help couples engage in effective money conversations,"As a comprehensive financial adviser, it is important to learn techniques for helping couples work through financial differences and engaging in financial conversations more productively. Although you are not a marital counselor, nor should you be playing that role, coaching couples on engaging in effective money conversations is within your purview. Curiosity is a great tool for tolerating clients' difficult feelings and mitigating financial conflicts. It helps you to be in the moment with your clients when the discussion taps into strong emotions, either for you or the clients. Although similar to curiosity, open-mindedness is more about a state of mind than being inquisitive. To be open-minded involves being receptive to ideas and practicing the Zen principle of beginner's mind. When couples engage in effective conflict, they must allow themselves to be vulnerable with each other and you. Therefore, it is vital that as the facilitator, you take a nurturing stance.

Retirement Planning and Life Insurance: Some Traps,"Retirement is often a time to re-examine your client's life insurance. This review may lead to the creation of an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) and the transfer of some or all of the client's existing life insurance to the ILIT. Two potential problem areas need to be considered before implementing the decision to create and fund an ILIT. The transfer of an existing life insurance policy to an ILIT is a taxable gift. Unfortunately, in the last 20 or so years, it has become increasingly difficult to determine the amount of the taxable gift. Once the policy is owned by the ILIT, the insured provides the funds for the payment of premiums by making annual gifts to the insurance trust. In the past, a great deal of attention was devoted to making those gifts qualify for the gift tax annual exclusion.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Feature,Dec,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Irrevocable trusts , Gifts , Life insurance trusts , Valuation , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Increasing the Sustainable Withdrawal Rate Using the Standby Reverse Mortgage,"This study investigates maximum real sustainable withdrawal rates (SWR) for retirement plans that incorporate the use of standby reverse mortgages (SRM). The SWR is defined as the maximum real withdrawal rate with a minimum 90% plan survival rate for a 30-year retirement horizon. Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the success of the SRM strategy at various real withdrawal rates for a client who has a $500,000 investment nest egg and $250,000/$500,000 in home equity at the beginning of retirement. The $500,000 nest egg is split into a 60% stocks and 40% bonds IP and a six-month cash reserve. Results pertaining to the low interest rate and current lending environment indicate that a 5.0% SWR is attainable for the SRM strategy when home equity is at least 50% of the IP at retirement. The SWR for the SRM strategy is estimated to be as high as 6.75% for retirees in the low interest rate environment where home equity is equal to the IP at the beginning of retirement.","Pfeiffer, Shaun, PhD;Salter, John, PhD, CFP, AIFA;Evensky, Harold, CFP, AIF", Feature,Dec,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Monte Carlo simulation , Sustainability , Withdrawals , Reverse mortgages , Interest rates , Retirement planning , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic
Measuring the Risk of Running Out of Money in Retirement,"This paper presents two important innovations that will help financial planners improve the spending and asset allocation decisions of their clients in retirement. The current prevalent approach of using a deterministic planning horizon (assuming a single death age) to assess sustainability risk often misrepresents the actual risk of running out of money in retirement. This paper proposes a simple way to measure sustainability risk -- mortality-adjusting -- that accounts for the joint occurrence of being alive and running out of money. Different assumptions regarding the age of death of a client leads to very different assessments of retirement sustainability risk. Results show the discrepancy in assessed sustainability risk computed using these different deterministic planning horizons, relative to the mortality-adjusting approach, to be quite large. Findings can help planners more accurately represent sustainability risk, thereby increasing the value they deliver to their retired clients.","Gardner, Grant, PhD;Pittman, Sam, PhD", Feature,Dec,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Retirement , Innovations , Sustainability , Asset allocation , Risk management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Actively Managed ETFs Attract Few Fans,"The exchange-traded fund industry is hot for actively managed ETFs. Many insiders see this as the next big thing. Dozens of fund companies have filed with the SEC for new products. They have their noisemakers out and are ready to party. All that's needed are investors -- and therein lies the problem; there are few to be found. The prospect of a uniform fiduciary standard for all advisers, including brokers, makes a core index-fund strategy even more appealing. Like traditional actively managed funds, the success or failure of an actively managed ETF will rely on one factor: performance. Putting active management under a lower-cost ETF umbrella isn't a panacea for bad management.

For some people, these are harder issues than saving enough to retire.

The first is the pre-retirement phase when thoughts and feelings about retirement begin entering the person's mind. Next comes the retirement phase itself. The third phase is the post-retirement phase, when the person has formed a new life under different social and psychological conditions. If you were to distill the collective experience and wisdom of successful retirees, one common theme stands out: The importance of taking the lead in reorganizing one's post-retirement relevance.

The 6.0 Percent Rule,"The 4% rule has come under scrutiny because of lower expectations about future security returns. Monte Carlo simulations using expected asset class risks and returns that reflect the current economy show that the first-year withdrawal can be 3.75% and increased for inflation each year, At 3.75%, portfolios with a 60% or higher equity exposure give a 90% chance of spending success over 30 years. The cash proceeds from various reverse mortgage plans can be taken in different ways. Scheduled monthly tax-free advances reduce the need for portfolio withdrawals and can give better spending success levels than line-of-credit draws. The increase in spending success levels depends on the relative value of the home and the portfolio. Given a portfolio value, higher home values raise success rates. With a 30-year spending horizon and first-year withdrawal of 6.0%, reverse mortgage scheduled advances as a portfolio supplement give spending success levels of 88% to 92%. Even with a first-year withdrawal of 6.5%, success levels are still 83% to 86%. This paper provides financial planners with a review of the relative merits of using a reverse mortgage as a retirement spending supplement.","Wagner, Gerald C, PhD", Feature,Dec,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Monte Carlo simulation , Mortgages , Reverse mortgages , Retirement planning , Rates of return , Success",ProQuest One Academic

It doesn't speak at all to the quality of his work, but it does mean that he won't act upon his conflicts of interest if they are not in the client's best interest. Where things get twisted in this argument is when planners use these as phrases that make them holier than thou. As a fee-only planner, the author still has conflicts of interest. He simply has fewer than when he also received commissions in the 1980s. He believes becoming fee-only helped build his career, not cost him it. Quality financial planning requires experience, ethics, and extensive education -- the keys to a profession.","Levin, Ross, CFP", Commentary,Dec,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Professions , Professional fees , Fiduciary responsibility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Understanding Retirement Date Risk: Why saving a little for a long time may be riskier than you think,"The mathematical benefits of saving early in life are pretty straightforward -- to have $1 million at retirement. However, as the account balance rises -- due to the accumulation of ongoing contributions and the annual compounding of growth itself -- each additional contribution actually has less and less of an impact on the annual increases of the balance over time. The problem with a strategy that becomes increasingly reliant on returns over time is that it leaves the prospective retiree highly prone to disappointment if market returns do not add up as anticipated in the final years. Viewed another way, a shorter path may require greater savings, but it also has less risk about whether the target retirement date will be achieved. This perspective arguably presents an alternative and better way of viewing the risk of unfavorable market returns, where clients consider the scenarios based not on the volatility of the wealth outcome, but also on the uncertainty of the retirement date.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Cover Story,Dec,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk management , Retirement planning , Rates of return , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Importance of Human Capital in Recovery from Divorce for Women,"This paper seeks to examine the risk exposure taken by women who elect not to invest in their own human capital and how that decision impacts their overall risk exposure in the household portfolio. A randomly selected and nationally representative sample of more than 600 divorced women was used for the analyses. The paper seeks to quantify the effect of investments in human capital on the income of divorced women using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79. Results indicate that both years of education and prior work experience are significant positive predictors of income for divorced women. Results suggest that women who decline to invest in their own human capital face significant downside exposure to financial shocks such as divorce, death, disability, market downturns, or unemployment of their spouse.","Bridges, Kimberly, PhD, CFP, CPW, CDFA;De'Armond, De'Arno, PhD;Dean, Lukas R, PhD", Feature,Nov,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Impact analysis , Divorce , Human capital , Unemployment , Portfolio investments , Risk exposure , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Asset Location Decision Revisited,"This study examines the asset location issue by answering the question of whether it is better to locate stocks in taxable accounts and bonds in tax-deferred accounts like a traditional IRA to the extent possible, while attaining the investors desired asset at location, or vice versa. Two groups of studies have examined this issue. The first uses the traditional approach to calculate an investor's asset allocation and generally has concluded that the optimal asset location decision depends upon specific assumptions about returns and tax rates. The second group uses the after-tax approach to calculate an investor's asset allocation and generally has concluded that the optimal asset location decision is to locate stocks in taxable accounts and bonds in retirement accounts to the extent possible while attaining the target asset allocation. This paper concludes by indicating that except in rare cases, investors should hold stocks in taxable accounts and bonds in retirement accounts.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA;Meyer, William", Feature,Nov,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Sensitivity analysis , Stocks , Tax rates , Asset allocation , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Lessons from Postage Meters,"Pitney Bowes started out as the only game in town. It not only had a differentiated business model, it was the only one approved to do what it did. But over time, the company faced increasing competition from other companies that could do the same thing. Price competition ensued to the point that the dispensing of postage became a commodity. The same could easily happen to the financial planning profession if they follow the Pitney Bowes model. Absent a monopoly, they've tended to use differentiation as their method of attracting clients. In the mid-1980s, financial planning firms began registering as RIAs, and ""fiduciary"" was their differentiator. The academic work of several Nobel laureates in the fields of finance, economics, and psychology formed the structure and processes of many firms, adding another layer of differentiation.

John Grable on Managing Stress and Linking Research with Practice,"In an interview, professor and editor John Grable, talked about about some of his groundbreaking research on stress management, his forthcoming book on communication essentials for planners, and what the profession needs to do to better link research to practice. As financial planners, they tend to view the word pretty simply. They have expertise. They analyze a client's situation and they give great recommendations. Everything they think about from the advisory point of view is focused on the client. But you need to put the clients' lenses on and look at yourself from their perspective. Many of the ways financial planners communicate, the gestures that they use, or how they interact interpersonally, that's nonverbal communication, and it works well if you're culturally attuned to that. The financial planning field is split into two camps. One camp says risk tolerance is absolutely an essential building block of all financial plans.","Schulaka, Carly", Interview,Nov,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Writers , Financial planners , Financial planning , Client relationships , United States--US , Grable, John",ProQuest One Academic

Keeping Up with Current Insurance Events,"This article is a potpourri of interesting and important insurance issues that recently have been in the news or observed in the author's client work. He hopes this information is useful in your practice. His long-term care insurance (LTC) positions expressed in late 1997 columns for the Journal were: 1. There was is a very limited market for LTC. 2. There was no real experience with pricing LTC, so companies would price it to sell and premiums would soar. 3. Stick with the most ethical companies. Rather soon after LTC policies were sold, many companies began raising premiums on existing policies. Many insurance sales begin with a client being solicited by an agent who highlights the fears and/or greed of a client that some insurance product will solve. Usually, the agent knows exactly what product he or she wants to sell before actually meeting the prospect.

Efficient Retirement Income Strategies and the Timing of Annuity Purchases,"This paper provides a framework for determining when a client should consider annuitizing some or all of their retirement assets. Based on the work of Pfau (2013). This study shows that clients who annuitize half of their spending needs now and delay annuitization of remaining spending needs for 20 years can obtain an efficient frontier that is nearly identical to that of annuitizing 100% of spending needs now. This paper adds to the literature by showing that clients who are unwilling to give up liquidity or invest 100% in equities should consider the timing of annuity products. As a clients preference for liquidity increases, planners should expect fewer assets to be allocated to illiquid investments.","Pittman, Sam, PhD", Feature,Nov,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Monte Carlo simulation , Stocks , Asset allocation , Liquidity , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

There are two versions of this hypothesis. The narrower form of the hypothesis states that when the US stock market in January is positive, the rest of the year will be positive. When the market rises in January, the market's total return over the subsequent February to December period is positive 80% of the time (44 out of 55).

How to Avoid Misclassifying Employees,"Whether you own a planning firm with one or many employees, or are an employee yourself, understanding the rules around classifying employees as exempt or non-exempt -- in other words, who is eligible for overtime and who is not -- can prevent misunderstandings, hard feelings, audits, and penalties. A financial planning firm has two owners and five employees. The five employees are an associate planner, a paraplanner, a portfolio/investment specialist, a client service specialist/executive assistant, and an administrative assistant. A complaint was filed with the state department of labor regarding employees working more than 40 hours per week and not getting paid overtime. Employees felt they were owned overtime, and this was substantiated through the audit. Improper or insufficient documentation did not support the employer's treatment of employee's pay. If a planning firm is audited, job descriptions will be reviewed to determine overtime eligibility. Legal and human resource experts will guide employers on how to communicate issues regarding misclassification and potential back pay.","Dunlap, Mary, CFP", Feature,Nov,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Overtime pay , Audits , Employees , Job descriptions , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Understanding and Dealing with Client Resistance to Change,"Financial planners routinely experience objections from clients and prospects in gaining agreement to proceed with implementing recommendations. Traditional sales training tends to view objections as a failure to properly explain the value or advantages of the product, service, or recommendation. If the client just had more information, or the right information, presented in the right way, then the objection would be overcome. The novice sales person who ""failed"" would put more effort into educating him or herself on the details and benefits of the product in preparation for the next sales opportunity. This article explores the change process, ambivalence toward change, resistance toward change, and introduces evidenced-based techniques to help financial planners shepherd clients through the change process.

What he takes from this quote is that challenges and stress may in fact be important ingredients in achieving the optimal human experience. Some of the most admired change-makers in history clearly endured and overcame incredibly stressful events. In many cases, the energy scores of advisers are under the mean because they are not committed to non-work activities. They don't allow themselves to retreat from work, even if it's just an hour to be home at the dinner table. All too often, the iPhone remains inseparable from the adviser, tethering him or her to work's unremitting demands. If you want to be an elite adviser, you must create optimal rhythm.

Why After-Tax Returns on Municipal Bonds May Be Lower than You Think,"With interest rates now rising from historically low levels, it is more crucial than ever for municipal bond investors to be diligent in the coordination of investment income and tax filing to avoid overpayment; a common mistake made with bonds bought at a premium. Depending on the unique circumstances of each investor impacted by this, incorrect filing could cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars per year. The potential impact varies depending on the state of residency: some states do not tax municipal bond interest at all, some tax interest only for out-of-state municipal bonds, and others tax all municipal bonds regardless of locality. In today's uncertain rate environment, it is more important than ever to help clients keep more of what they earn. Investors who own municipal bonds that are subject to taxation should refer to IRS Publication 550 to determine the proper way to account for income and amortization over time.","Collins, William R, IV, CFP®, CRPC®", Cover Story,Oct,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Investment income , Interest rates , Municipal bonds , Tax returns , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Others, having reached a certain level of success, opt to put business growth on the back burner to focus on personal growth -- be it time with family, a hobby or another area of interest. Neil C.

Duration is the measure of a security's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and the number provides a good sense of how much a bond's price will decline as interest rates rise.

Avoiding Post-ATRA Trust Tax Rates,"The 39.6% ordinary tax rate and 20% capital gain tax rate enacted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), and the 3.8% Medicare investment surtax now apply when trust income exceeds $11,950. These high rates apply at much lower levels of income for trusts than for individual taxpayers. With this disparity in mind, grantors creating trusts and trustees managing trusts should consider some strategies. There are two broad types of trusts: grantor mists and nongrantor trusts. Grantor trusts are ignored for tax purposes, and an individual grantor pays tax on the income earned by the assets in the trust on their personal Form 1040. Nongrantor trusts are taxable entities for which the trustee must file a tax return (Form 1041).

Sequence-of-Returns Risk: Gorilla or Boogeyman?,"A common metaphor for sequence-of-returns (SOR) risk involves choosing a ball from an urn filled with many identical balls. Each ball announces the inflation rate and returns for the portfolio's holdings or asset classes for the year. The risk to a client's retirement income plan comes from the chance of having a number of bad draws in the first four to six years. Therein lies the pesky part: there's nothing you can do about luck of the draw. This is a major reason why most sustainable withdrawal rate research can't compute a more generous result at high levels of success. Quantifying the potential impact of SOR risk on sustainable withdrawal rates and/or underlying portfolio values typically involves comparing what happens when a specific return and inflation sequence over a period of years is reversed. For a healthier financial situation, employ dynamic, rather than static, policies to guide annual decision-making about the asset allocation and distribution amount.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®", Feature,Oct,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Sustainability , Withdrawals , Inflation , Rates , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Affected clients can still use exclusions and above-the-line deductions, such as contributions to qualified retirement plans, traditional IRAs, and health savings accounts to lower MAGI and potentially reduce the Medicare surtax.

Is an All Cash Emergency Fund Strategy Appropriate for All Investors?,"Holding emergency fund assets in cash may not be utility maximizing for many households that invest with financial planners. Drawing on utility theory, this paper analyzes an all cash emergency fund strategy and compares it to funds held with varying levels of equities. This study relies on a simulation-based approach with stochastic real asset class returns and income/expense shocks. The results demonstrate that, when compared with varying levels of equities, there is a monotonic increase in wealth at retirement as the total portfolio becomes more aggressive. Holding a separate cash emergency fund increases the standard deviation of total dollar-weighted returns, as compared to the total portfolio approach. Results also suggest that including equities as part of the emergency fund strategy reduces instances of funding inadequacy. Given that wealth is fungible, financial planning professionals may want to consider the increased efficiency (higher return/lower risk) of a total portfolio approach to managing both retirement and precautionary savings goals.","Scott, Janine, PhD;Williams, Duncan, CFP;Gilliam, John, PhD, CFP, CLU;Sybrowsky, Jacob P, PhD, CRC, RFC", Feature,Sep,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Financial planning , Standard deviation , Stochastic models , Investment policy , Portfolio management",ProQuest One Academic

The second reason is that selling isn't what it used to be. He thinks one of the things that's important to understand is why they think of sales as disreputable. One of the other reasons people don't like sales, why people often recoil from the very notion of sales, is that sales involves a lot of rejection.

Financial Steps after the Loss of a Loved One,"As the financial planning industry took off in the 1990s and 2000s, baby boomers were saving for education expenses for their children and for their own retirement. It was important to have life insurance and estate documents in place in the event they died prematurely, but those documents control what happens many months after they have passed away. Developing a tailored checklist for the family to go through at death can minimize stress for grieving spouses and children. Here's some of the proposed checklist for your clients and begin to tailor it to their needs: 1. Locate the letters of last instruction. 2. Notify family, friends, and employers, 3. Locate information for the death certificate. 4. Make funeral arrangements. 5. Set meeting with attorney, planner, and others. 6. Delay important financial decisions. 7. Gather important paperwork. 8. Pay expenses, organize bills, and follow a budget. 9. Notify financial institutions. 10. Record the will. 11. Start the claims process. 12. Determine employer benefits. 13. Gather important documents. 14. Meet with attorney. 15. Address miles, points, and rewards.","Bissett, William, CFP", Feature,Sep,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Survivor , Baby boomers , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

What You Need to Know about the Affordable Care Act and Health Insurance Exchanges,"Three experts to provide the information planners need about the rollout of health insurance exchanges, how the new insurance mandates will work, and the implications for financial planning decisions in this emerging new world of health insurance. Katy Votava, founder of www.GoodCare.com, said that one thing that's going to be quite different for the consumer is making their own choice. Up until now, people who've had a choice for health insurance have had employers preselect one or two plans, and that's it. Arthur Tacchino, chief innovation officer at SyncStream Solutions LLC, thinks the biggest change as far as a planner is concerned is the play or pay tax, which is really the driving force behind employers' decisions about whether to continue to offer employer-sponsored health care coverage or drop coverage and lead people to the exchanges. The main thing for planners is helping clients understand what their medical spending personality is.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Cover Story,Sep,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Health insurance exchanges , Insurance coverage , Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act 2010-US , Health insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Using Life Insurance to Fund Special Needs Trusts,"Parents of children with autism, Down syndrome, and other income-limiting physical or psychiatric conditions bear a special burden that is both financial and emotional. A valuable financial planning tool that can address the financial burden, and thereby help with the emotional burden, is the special needs trust (SNT). Typically, a special needs trust is established as a third-party supplemental needs trust. SNTs are created and funded by someone other than the beneficiary, and expressly state that the trustee may only distribute trust income and assets for the beneficiary's needs in excess of services provided by the government. The trust also includes a spendthrift clause, which places the assets beyond the reach of the beneficiary's creditors. In an era of higher tax rates, life insurance can be an ideal funding vehicle for special needs trusts. Although circumstances will vary, use of a maximum-funded, low-death-benefit variable universal life insurance policy typically will be appropriate, especially when the projected time frame and the grantor's financial risk tolerance are consistent with equity-based returns.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA", Feature,Sep,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Exceptional children , Financial planners , Life insurance , Trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Simple Formulas to Implement Complex Withdrawal Strategies,"This paper demonstrates how two simple formulas can be used to determine the optimal portfolio withdrawal amount each year during retirement. The first formula, which is called the dynamic formula, determines the withdrawal percentage for a given target probability of success, portfolio equity allocation, expected retirement period, and fees (or alpha). A measure called the withdrawal efficiency rate is used to determine the optimal inputs for distribution equations, as well as the relative efficiency of the formula approach. Results indicated that life expectancy (median mortality) plus two years is a relatively efficient estimate for the expected retirement period and that 80% is a reasonable input for the probability of success. Paper equations capture 99,9% of the relative efficiency of a far more complex methodology and represent a significant improvement over a static approach. This suggests that while simple, the formulas are nevertheless an incredibly efficient method to implement a dynamic withdrawal strategy for a retiree.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CFA", Feature,Sep,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Monte Carlo simulation , Portfolio performance , Retirement planning , Retirement , Efficiency , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Benefits of a Cash Reserve Strategy in Retirement Distribution Planning,"This study investigates plan survival rates, or the percentage of simulated retirement plans, that continue to provide real adequate income at a given point in retirement for two common distribution strategies. Reverse dollar cost averaging (RDCA), which does not include cash reserves, is compared to a one-year cash flow reserve distribution strategy (CFR), which includes cash reserves equal to one year of income needs. Results suggest that cash reserve distribution strategies improve the likelihood of realizing adequate real income when the reduction in the risk of having to sell investments at depressed prices, taxes, and transaction costs outweighs the opportunity cost of lower expected returns. Results indicate that plan survival rates of the CFR strategy are up to as much as 6 percentage points higher than the plan survival rates for the RDCA strategy at the 30-year mark in retirement.","Pfeiffer, Shaun, PhD;Salter, John, PhD, CFP, AIFA;Evensky, Harold, CFP, AIF", Feature,Sep,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Monte Carlo simulation , Transaction costs , Expected returns , Retirement planning , Cash management",ProQuest One Academic
Creating an ROL-Centered Practice,"The task of creating a financial plan is often viewed by clients as a one-time event that easily becomes outdated. As a financial plan becomes outdated, clients begin to chafe at paying the same fee for what they perceive as less effort. The real value is in monitoring the planning on how personal, how frequent, and how synchronized the monitoring is to the client's life and circumstances. The return on life (ROL) practitioner perceives that for a financial plan to be a living, breathing instrument, it must be infused with aspects addressing individualized life needs in the context of money that basic data gathering, analysis, and projections alone cannot provide. The ultimate end of a financial plan is that it will comprehend a client's meaning as it relates to his or her means. The result of the ROL approach is that your client relationships move toward a life-driven rather than a numbers-driven dynamic.","Anthony, Mitch", Feature,Sep,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Regulatory Reform Is Not Complicated,"In the years since Dodd-Frank, no action has been taken to hold brokers accountable to a fiduciary standard. You can be forgiven if you have the impression it is a complicated issue. It ain't. The brokerage industry is concerned and has spent considerable effort conveying their angst to Congress, complete with a request for information and comment that was tainted with assumptions slanted in favor of an outcome Wall Street would like. Today, sadly, the public remains confused and not well protected. And earlier this year, a couple of new twists arose. In June, the House Financial Services Committee sent H.R. 2374: Retail Investor Protection Act to the full House for consideration. If enacted, it would force the Department of Labor to wait until the SEC comes out with its rule before it can proceed with issuing an expansion of the applicability of the fiduciary standard.","Moisand, Dan, CFP", Feature,Sep,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Reforms , Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act 2010-US , Fiduciary liability , Regulatory reform , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Risk Management as Alpha Generator,"As the authors write this column in mid-June, domestic stock indexes are in rarefied air.

The wariest are expecting the inevitable correction, or worse, to be right around the corner. Never mind that these diversified and well-risk-managed portfolios have enjoyed returns well above long-term averages and far above any reasonable expectations from a financial planning perspective. Most of these facts are grounded in simple arithmetic. Your clients may not view the arithmetic as simple, but the irrefutable truth of these facts should give them professionals the fortitude to persist in their explanations to clients that what they are doing for them is in their best interests, even though it may not be immediately evident.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFP, CFA, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP", Feature,Sep,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Risk management , Portfolio investments , Affluence , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

5 Steps to Planning for Internal Successors in a Small Business Environment,"As the baby boomer generation nears retirement, sole proprietors and managing equity partners are beginning to focus on an exit strategy for their small businesses. In general, the available exit strategies are to sell the business to an internal successor; sell the business to an external party; or merge with a complementary business and sell to an internal successor or external party at a later date. Among family owned businesses, 52% plan to transfer ownership and management to family members, although 50% express concern about whether their successor has the drive and aptitude to steward the business into the future, according to Pricewaterhouse Coopers' 2012 Family Business Survey. Succession planning programs often differ in many details, but essentially, the major steps in developing a succession plan are: 1. Identify high-potential candidates. 2. Define the knowledge, skills, and abilities of a capable successor. 3. Assess candidate strengths and weaknesses. 4. Identify developmental opportunities. 5.

A Scenario Based Approach to After-Tax Asset Allocation,"This paper discusses an alternative to standard optimization techniques to determine the asset allocation and asset location for an investor with accounts with different tax treatments. While portfolio optimization approaches can be useful, optimization serves only as a starting point from which a financial adviser can model various scenarios and find which is most appropriate for a client given their considerations of risk, return, and taxes. This approach produces intuitive, practical, and robust results. The incorporation of financial planning techniques such as asset allocation, asset location, and the drawing down of assets in retirement are discussed in this paper. Cheap and fast computing power allow an adviser to consider different scenarios and present them to clients in terms of intuitive metrics such as returns, volatilities, draw downs, tax consequences, and ultimately their impact upon goals such as saving for retirement.","Berkin, Andrew L, PhD;Freed, Glenn S, PhD, CPA;Rowling, Sheryl L, CPA", Feature,Aug,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Optimization , Asset allocation , Optimization techniques , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Rather, advisers exhaust themselves following up with ill-matched inquiries, or worse yet, they miss out on opportunity they never knew existed. For service-focused businesses like financial planning, online marketing relies on driving response. Direct marketing relies on three essential elements, all intertwined: 1. List is the people to whom you market. 2. Offer is the hook to attract the target audience member to identify herself and her interest. 3. Creative is the way in which you present your service.

The Custody Rule: It's Not Just for Custodians,"When it comes to custody, most registered investment advisers avoid it like you avoid the obnoxious coworker at the company party. Both require careful maneuvering to evade, are easy to confront if you're not paying attention, and can be extremely challenging to understand when engaged. Suffice it to say, accidental or unintentional custody can have extreme consequences. The Custody Rule is actually Rule 206(4)-2 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Act). After significant amendments in 2003 and 2009, it has enjoyed considerable periods in the regulatory spotlight due to its broader reach and added complexity, most notably for advisers who may not have previously had custody on their radar. This year, the Custody Rule made its way into the SEC's examination priorities letter, as well as a March 2013 SEC risk alert entitled Significant Deficiencies Involving Adviser Custody and Safety of Client Assets.","Stanley, Chris", Cover Story,Aug,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Custodians , Investment advisors , SEC regulations , Amendments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Allocating Assets between a Bypass Trust and a Marital Trust,"Recent reports of the death of the bypass trust at the hands of portability are exaggerated. Prior to enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the portability of a deceased spouse's unused exclusion amount, married couples were faced with a straightforward issue -- the estate tax exemption was a use it or lose it proposition. To avoid losing it, estate plans typically provided that the first spouse to die would leave assets equal to his or her exemption to a bypass trust, which would provide the surviving spouse with lifetime benefits but was drafted so that it was not included in the survivor's taxable estate. Unfortunately, this increased protection comes at a cost in terms of technical compliance with an IRS Revenue Procedure that will soon be celebrating its 50th anniversary -- Revenue Procedure 64-19.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Feature,Aug,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Spousal remainder trusts , Asset allocation , Revenue procedures & rulings , Estate taxes , Tax exemptions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Understanding Unusual Social Security Claiming Strategies,"Two unconventional strategies for claiming Social Security benefits (""claim and suspend"" and ""claim now, claim more later"") have the potential to pay higher lifetime benefits to some individuals and increase costs within the Social Security system. Claim and suspend allows an individual who has reached full retirement age to claim benefits and then immediately suspend them, either to put his or her own benefits on hold if reentering the workforce, or to allow a spouse to claim a spousal benefit while the individual continues to work and earn delayed retirement credits. In the ""claim now, claim more later"" strategy, a married individual at or past full retirement age claims a spousal benefit while delaying claiming his or her own retired-worker benefit to build up delayed retirement credits. It is possible that policymakers may evaluate these strategies as they look to trim expenses by reducing cost increasing provisions to ensure they are consistent with the basic goals of the Social Security program.","Munnell, Alicia H, PhD;Golub-Sass, Alex;Karamcheva, Nadia S, PhD", Feature,Aug,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Social security , Retirement benefits , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Taking Leadership Seriously,"The recent Boston Marathon bombings provide an opportunity to reflect on what leadership means. In the aftermath of the heinous acts on April 15, Boston law enforcement personnel were lauded for their leadership in bringing a horrible situation to a close. One of the many things that stands out about those efforts is how seamlessly different law enforcement agencies worked together, seemingly unhampered by politics or infighting. But it doesn't require a crisis to consider your approach to leadership. In thinking about your role as a leader, it's useful to examine it from three different angles: 1. leadership activities, 2. leadership style, and 3. leadership role.

One Life Insurance Size Doesn't Fit All Estate Planning Situations,"Life insurance has been the key asset associated with estate planning for decades. When an estate has been set up properly, a couple can avoid estate taxes on $10.5 million of assets. The critical planning device is for each spouse to have at least $5.25 million in their own name so that regardless of who dies first, their credit equivalent will be fully used. Life insurance works for estate taxes because estate taxes are due when death occurs -- the same trigger that pays life insurance death benefits. But one life insurance size doesn't fit all estate planning situations. If the insured is in good health with a reasonable chance of making it to 100, either the policy's premiums need to be changed so the policy's cash value will equal the death benefit at 100, or a new policy should be looked at. Life insurance is an ideal estate planning asset.

Should Planners Bypass the Bypass Trust?,"The bypass trust, also known as the B trust or credit-shelter trust, has long been used as a key element in estate planning for wealthier families. Structured properly, this trust usually provides the surviving spouse income and the limited right to invade trust corpus while avoiding estate taxation after the first spouse's death. It does so by allowing the first decedent to use their $5.25 million exclusion -- the new applicable lifetime exclusion amount for 2013 thanks to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Not surprisingly, the bypass trust has lost its luster with many planners and estate attorneys, however, the bypass trust could still play an important role in estate planning for a number of reasons. These are: 1. protecting subsequent spouses, 2. asset protection, 3. transfer of two or more generations removed, 4. preventing accidental disinheritance, 5. professional management, 6. spendthrift provisions, 7. avoiding probate, and 8. growth outside the estate.

End the Charade: Replacing the Efficient Frontier with the Efficient Range,"Imprecise estimates are one source of gaps between optimized mean-variance portfolios and portfolios that investors prefer. Investor preferences beyond high mean and low variance is the other source. Both sources of gaps call for investor judgment. Harry Markowitz, who introduced mean-variance portfolio theory and its optimizer, noted that judgment plays an essential role in the proper application of mean-variance analysis. The charade of the efficient frontier involves massaging the estimates of the mean-variance parameters until they yield the efficient frontier and portfolios they prefer. This paper offers the ""efficient range"" the location of portfolios that acknowledge imprecise estimates of mean-variance parameters and accommodate investor preferences beyond high mean and low variance, as a replacement for the ""efficient frontier.""

It explains why health care premiums are rising, the opportunity for employers to offer coverage through the Affordable Care Act's exchanges, and why the play or pay tax of ACA is making employers reevaluate their employer-sponsored plans. The factors above create the need for planners and advisers to understand the alternative strategies available to employers regarding health care reform. This paper also evaluates and explains what these alternative strategies are. It specifically addresses some of the following strategies: 1. Continue offering current coverage ""as is;"" 2. Decrease employer contributions to coverage; 3. Switch to a cheaper plan (a plan that has a tower actuarial value); 4. Drop coverage and pay the penalty under the ""Play or Pay tax; 5.

Permanent Portability Offers New Opportunities,"With the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) establishing portability as permanent, viable estate planning and gifting opportunities have increased. As a planner, you should understand these opportunities to help a married couple appropriately choose between portability and a bypass trust to effectively use both of their applicable exclusions and to protect their families from estate taxes. A portability election can play an unprecedented role in ultimately helping to avoid or reduce a married couples estate and income taxes. It is critical for a competent surviving spouse or executor to file an estate tax return within nine months of death (or within 15 months with an extension) even if no tax is owed. An optimal approach to leverage planning would empower the surviving spouse with the decision-making ability of whether or not to rely on portability.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP®, CTFA, AEP®", Cover Story,Jul,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Couples , Tax legislation , Exclusion , Estate taxes , Estate planning , Trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Using a Simplified Deterministic Model to Estimate Retirement Income Sustainability,"Much of the research on sustainable retirement withdrawal rates has been based on historical market returns and fairly complex Monte Carlo multivariate scenario analysis using third-party software that soften difficult to customize. A simplified deterministic model, based upon the same Monte Carlo capital market inputs (expected arithmetic return and portfolio volatility) can efficiently provide Monte Carlo type answers to retirement income sustainability. The simplified method presented in this paper uses standard deviation for conversion of arithmetic average return to the derived geometric average return for each level of confidence. The deterministic model allows financial planners to easily incorporate customized withdrawal or success calculations into their proprietary workflows using a simple spreadsheet program. As discussed in this paper, the historical success and more recent failure of the 4% rule can be explained by the ratio of the real withdrawal rate to the portfolio arithmetic average return, and also recent market related reductions in the expected geometric average return.","Kasten, Gregory W, MD, CFP®, CPC, AIFA®", Feature,Jul,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Monte Carlo simulation , Financial planners , Workflow software , Retirement , Expected returns , Retirement income",ProQuest One Academic
SEC Examination Priorities for 2013: Translated into Plain English,"On Feb 21, 2013, the SEC published its examination priorities for the year. Some have called it the literary trifecta of the millennium. Be that as it may, there are still important takeaways that every registered investment adviser would do well to incorporate into his or her compliance program. SEC's examination priorities include: 1. fraud detection and prevention, 2. corporate governance and enterprise risk management, 3. conflicts of interest, 4. technology, 5. safety of assets, 6. compensation arrangements and payments for distribution in guise, 7. marketing/performance, 8. new registrants, and 9. dually registered investment advisers and broker-dealers. The SEC certainly has its hands full and must efficiently use its limited resources to fulfill its mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. To accomplish this daunting task, the SEC has adopted a risk-based examination framework that guides its National Examination Program.","Stanley, Chris", Feature,Jun,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Priorities , Investment advisors , SEC regulations , Efficient markets , Compliance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Bouncing Back,"Thinking about resilience taps into the fertile ground of many sources of crisis and failure. It might be a personal experience, a sports figure, an actor, past presidents, or friends.

The Shift from Accumulation to Distribution: What It Means for Planner Revenue,"For many years, the financial planning industry media have built up expectations of revenue inflows as baby boomers retire and realize they need professionals to help them manage their retirement funds. Financial planners, journalists, and consultants often discuss how the transition from retirement asset accumulation to distribution can create problems with traditional revenue models.

Although the majority of respondents do not expect revenue to change much, if at all, as clients transition into retirement, one-third expect the amount of revenue generated by fees to increase, and another 24% anticipate an increase in commissions from annuity sales.

An Intuitive Examination of Downside Risk,"This paper offers insight regarding several unresolved issues related to downside risk evaluation. Specifically the authors provide clarity to semivariance, which is a well-known, but often misunderstood risk measure. They examine the calculation methodology for both semivariance and semideviation and give practical financial planning interpretations. Semideviation is used in the Sortino ratio, which assesses return per unit of downside risk. The Sortino ratio is pervasive and well understood, but they question whether a majority of practitioners can make an accurate calculation of the semideviation measure. Popular asset class returns from 1926-2011 are examined, and we find that while small company stocks and large company stocks have similar Sharpe ratios, small stocks have superior Sortino ratios. The information ratio is an important measure of active fund manager performance. We suggest replacing the standard deviation of active return with the semideviation. A real-world example demonstrates the value of this revised metric.","Washer, Kenneth M, DBA, CFP, CFA, CPA;Johnson, Robert R, PhD, CFA, CAIA", Feature,Jun,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Standard deviation , Stocks , Risk assessment",ProQuest One Academic
More than Enough Money,"Again and again, clients need advisors to communicate in ways that range from simple to savvy to sophisticated. Relating this to the analytical and the behavioral forces of retirement income planning leads the author to an inescapable conclusion: it is exceedingly likely that many of their current and future retired clients will leave behind more money at the end of their lives than they can possibly imagine today. This is because there is possibly no area of financial planning where the behavioral and analytical forces move so strongly in the same direction. In their client relationships, they are asked to show skill and nimbleness in situations teeming with the fear of scarcity as well as the possibility of abundance. The ongoing client relationships at the heart of the financial planning process are ideally suited for the conversations that can help clients see what is happening, if they are able to let them.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP", Commentary,Jun,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Client relationships , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The 4 Percent Rule Is Not Safe in a Low-Yield World,"The safety of a 4% initial withdrawal strategy depends on asset return assumptions. Using historical averages to guide simulations for failure rates for retirees spending an inflation-adjusted 4% of retirement date assets over 30 years results in an estimated failure rate of about 6%. This modest projected failure rate rises sharply if real returns decline. As of January 2013, intermediate-term real interest rates were about 4% less than the historical average used in previous simulations. Calibrating bond returns to the January 2013 yields offered on five-year TIPS to match the duration of bond investments used in previous simulations, while maintaining the historical equity premium, causes the projected failure rate for retirement account withdrawals to jump to 57%. Results from this analysis suggest that the 4% rule cannot be treated as a safe initial withdrawal rate.","Finke, Michael, PHD, CFP;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA;Blanchett, David M, CFP, CFA", Feature,Jun,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Sensitivity analysis , Bonds , Interest rates , Retirement planning , Rates of return , Simulation , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Tactical, to them, is where they, as the manager of the portfolio, are changing the allocation between asset classes. Jerry Miccolis, CIO, Brinton Eaton, said in their view, modern portfolio theory is just taking what they call the three Rs for each asset class -- returns, risk, and relationships with other asset classes -- and figuring out what the best mix of those asset classes are to get the best-performing portfolio in some sort of risk-adjusted sense. Mebane Faber, CIO, Cambria Investment Management, said one of the biggest challenges in tactical portfolio is sticking with your guns and not letting your emotions guide you to the market fads and the psychology of pain of loss.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Feature,Jun,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Trends , Investment advisors , Asset allocation , Portfolio investments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Investing in Future Generations: Evolution of the Business Skills Trust,"Less than one-third of family businesses survive the transition from the first to the second generation, and only about 10% survive the transition to the third generation, according to stats reported in the Harvard Business Review.

This column introduces readers to the initial results of that project: the business skills trust (BST). The BST is not intended to replace family governance of a business or to create a one-size-fits-all trust within a rules-based framework. It is merely the means to lubricate the wheels of ownership transition through the use of a trust to mitigate any impact on the operations and profitability of the family business.","Gallo, Eileen, PhD", Feature,Jun,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Transitions , Family owned businesses , Corporate planning , Profitability , Trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The New Estate Planning Dilemma: Simplicity or Asset Protection?,"The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) retained the inflation-adjusted $5.25 million gift, estate, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax exclusion and the portable gift and estate tax exclusion for surviving spouses, but increased the gift, estate, and generation-skipping tax rate to 40%. When reviewing clients' estate plans, watch for mandatory allocations to bypass trusts based on the current tax exemption. Depending on the wording of the funding language, the trust may require that a bypass trust be created and possibly all of the trust assets be allocated to the irrevocable bypass trust rather than a revocable survivor's trust. In particular, the surviving spouse should consider the potential benefits of making lifetime gifts to use the DSUFA left by his or her deceased spouse. With regard to the use of bypass trusts, clients will need to choose between the simplicity of the one-trust approach and the protections of the more complex two-trust approach.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CFP, CPA;Daff, Leslie, JD;Dymond, Lew, JD;Welch, Julie, CFP, CPA", Commentary,Jun,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Tax legislation , Tax rates , Exclusion , Estate planning , Trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Doug Lennick on Moral Intelligence and the Value of Behavioral Advice,"In an interview, author Doug Lennick, founder, Think2Perform, talked about how planners can better understand clients' seemingly irrational behavior, and how they can help all clients make better financial decisions. The way the brain actually works is that practice does not make perfect, practice makes permanent. Whatever people repeatedly think or do gets wired into the habit center of their brains. What they are allowed to do with their mind, which operates within the brain, is they can use their mind to decide what to think to change their physical brain. That's called neuroplasticity. Greed will stimulate irrational behavior, and fear will stimulate irrational behavior. There are many strategies planners can help their clients make better financial decisions, but one is just to help the client deal with the truth of uncertainty. So, the best thing advisers can do for clients is prepare them financially for virtually anything that can happen.","Schulaka, Carly", Interview,May,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Behavior , Financial planning , Client relationships , Brain , United States--US , Lennick, Doug",ProQuest One Academic
Controlling the Urges: How Biases Influence Our Investment Decisions,"Behavioral biases are traits or tendencies that influence people to think and act in certain ways. All people have some combination of behavioral biases. Biases are either of a cognitive or emotional nature. Biases are generally latent, and their influence often is subconscious, usually influencing you in stressful or emotional situations, so you are seldom aware of their influence. However, by asking the right questions, you can proactively identify specific biases that may influence you, and take measures to reduce the influence of those biases. Cognitive biases influence the way you think and may be corrected through recognition of the bias, education, and illustration. Financial advisers can help their clients understand their error in thinking by providing evidence of such error and examples of correct thoughts. Emotional biases often are more difficult to tackle because feelings are complex. Emotional biases may be best considered in the portfolio recommendation and investment management phase.","Mooreland, Jay, CFP", Feature,May,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Bias , Behavioral sciences , Financial planning , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Power Tools for Handling Behavioral Finance Issues,"The coming decades are ripe with promise for improving the well-being of people and the planet.

Skills training for navigating interpersonal relationships should be on par with training in technical aspects of financial planning. To that end, five mission-critical skill sets or power tools have been identified for preparing for and performing effectively in a super trend environment. These cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal skills are described in this article, highlighting the critical role of each and providing a set of specific practices for learning and deepening one's skills.

Help Investors Make Better Risk/Reward Decisions,"Worldwide, humans share a curious, common, and overlooked propensity to automatically perceive many risks as greater or less than they actually are. These deep-rooted risk misperceptions make it easy to unknowingly set themselves up for misjudgments, lost opportunities, and unpleasant surprises, particularly when investing. Without realizing it, these and other ingrained perception errors can cause them to undermine their own best interests. The following key factors affecting perception of risk provide the foundation for understanding, addressing, correcting, and then neutralizing the impact of many common misperceptions of risk: 1. trust, 2. risk versus benefit, 3. control, 4. choice, 5. natural versus man-made, 6. horror, 7. catastrophic versus chronic, 8. uncertainty, 9. you versus them, and 10. new versus familiar. Over time, your efforts to familiarize yourself and your clients with these risk perception traps will make it easier for you to remind clients of those traps if they fall victim to them.","Carpenter, Michael T", Feature,May,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk , Perceptions , Decision making , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Musings on Behavioral Finance,"The behavioral finance field grew up in a world where the prevailing academic assumption was that people, as a group, behave rationally. The assumption of rationality is a strong one and, over the decades, many studies have demonstrated both experimental and real-world evidence of violations of strictly rational behavior. Fair enough, people aren't fully rational, but it's dangerous to leap to the other extreme that people are utterly irrational. Numerous money managers have created money management strategies designed to exploit various behavioral anomalies. It would be interesting to see whether managers who have tried to exploit these anomalies under real-world conditions have better success than managers who employ more traditional techniques. The future is bright for behavioral finance.

Enhancing the Returns of SRI Portfolios Using a Minimum Variance Small-Basket Strategy,"The focus of this research is on enhancing the returns of socially responsible investment (SRI) portfolios by constructing minimum variance small-basket portfolios. Results suggest that individual investors and professional financial planners, on behalf of their clients, can realize enhanced performance relative to SRI funds that contain a large number of stocks by constructing minimum variance portfolios that generally contain fewer than 10 stocks. Over the 10-year period from 2002 through 2011, which is a function of the availability of SRI fund return data, the average annual excess returns for the minimum variance small-basket portfolios range from 2.59% to 6.99% relative to the larger SRI funds from which the small-basket funds are constructed. Measures of total risk and downside risk further support the enhanced performance of the minimum variance small-basket portfolio strategy. Perhaps most importantly, the minimum variance small-basket strategy described in this paper can be implemented easily by individual investors or by professional financial planners on behalf of their clients.","Larsen, Glen A, Jr, DBA, CFA, CIPM", Feature,May,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Social investing , Rates of return , Portfolio management , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Hedging Longevity Risk for Worry-Free Retirement,"Financial planners recognize that insurance, as a risk management tool, is designed to transfer the risk of uncertain outcomes to an entity that can spread those risks among many insureds. From a financial perspective, transferring risk by purchasing insurance is usually more effective than other risk management tools, such as risk retention and avoidance, when the probability of a risk is small and the financial consequence of experiencing the risk is large. Longevity risk poses challenges for planners and their clients. The nature of longevity risk and methods of dealing with it have changed over time. Over the past 30 years or so there has been a shift away from traditional DB plans toward defined contribution plans, especially cash or deferred arrangements such as 401(k) and 403(b) plans. As the products employed have changed, so have the planning risks. A particularly enticing aspect of longevity insurance is the fact that, unlike life insurance, it is not underwritten, so planners can use adverse selection to their clients' advantage.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CLU, CFA;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA", Feature,May,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Life insurance , Risk management , Defined contribution plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Inflation, Hyperinflation, Adjustment Lags: Why TIPS Don't Guarantee Real Rates of Return","Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are popular investment vehicles for investors concerned with maintaining positive real returns during periods of inflation. However, the popular idea that TIPS guarantee a given real rate of return is not true. Of course, during periods of inflation. TIPS returns greatly exceed those of standard, non-inflation adjusted, Treasury bonds. Nonetheless, as inflation increases, the real realized yield of TIPS declines. The explanation is that the mechanics of adjusting for inflation for TIPS limit the exactness of the inflation adjustment. The adjustment to the TIPS principal reflects CPI values from about three months prior to the adjustment. Such adjustment lags are a fact of life for any inflation-adjusted contract, at least until someone develops the foresight to provide true ex ante inflation data. The adjustment lag mechanics for any inflation protected contract limit all such contracts to being only appropriate inflation hedges. Financial planners should realize that TIPS are just one tool in the inflation toolbox.","Laatsch, Francis, PhD, CFP, CFA", Feature,May,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Studies , Inflation , Securities , Rates of return",ProQuest One Academic
The ABCDs of Retirement Success,"Past research has introduced the concept of ""Gamma,"" which is a metric designed to quantify the potential retirement income benefits that an investor can realize from making intelligent financial planning decisions. This paper continues this line of research, but focuses on the accumulation phase, examining the relative importance of four different factors called the ""ABCDs of Retirement Success."" These factors are: Alpha, Beta, Cash Flows (savings for accumulators and distributions for referees), and the benefits of Delayed Retirement. Through multivariate regressions and constrained optimizations, this research shows the relative importance of each factor for different scenarios. The authors find that while each of the different factors considered are important, they are not equally important, and affect outcomes differently. For example, the relative importance of Cash Flows depends on the size of an investors account balance. They also find that for a hypothetical investor nearing retirement, delaying retirement a single year can increase the probability of success by approximately 10.6%, which is approximately equivalent to generating 1.0% of Alpha during each year of the entire retirement period.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, CFA", Feature,May,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Regression analysis , Studies , Retirement planning , Cash flow , Success , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Another Case of Bad Facts Making Bad Law,"Kite v. Comm'r, T.C.

5 Ways to Handle a Long-Term-Care Insurance Rate Increase,"As the long-term-care (LTC) insurance industry continues to struggle in today's low interest rate environment, a growing number of clients who bought long-term-care insurance in the past are getting notifications of premium increases -- and often they're very significant increases, even from major companies like Genworth, John Hancock, Prudential, and MetLife. While the rate increase may be a shock, the reality is that in many cases the coverage is still cheaper than it would be to buy the policy anew in today's marketplace -- which essentially means that even with the premium increase, continuing the LTC coverage can be a pretty good deal. The good news is that given how much more expensive LTC insurance is in the current marketplace, it's drastically less likely there will be premium increases on today's new policies. However, it's still necessary to properly deal with and navigate the rate increases that are occurring on coverage purchased years ago.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Feature,Apr,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Long term care insurance , Insurance rates , Insurance coverage , Insurance premiums , Insurance industry , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Dividend Investing: A Value Tilt in Disguise?,"In today's near-zero interest rate environment, dividend investing is back in fashion. The popularity of stocks that offer investors generous dividend distributions has only been heightened by their recent performance. From Jan 1, 2011, to Sep 30, 2012, the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index of US stocks returned 26% compared to just 19% for the S&amp;P 500 Index. In seeking to better understand the outperformance of high-dividend-yielding stocks relative to the broader equity market, this paper dissects their return patterns and examines returns over a period of more than 30 years through the lens of risk factors. Results suggest that it was actually the value factor that is inherent in most high-dividend-yielding stocks that was responsible for the outperformance of these stocks over the period studied. The yield factor associated with high-dividend-yielding stocks actually detracted from performance.","Fisher, Gregg S, CFA, CFP", Feature,Apr,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Dividends , Stocks , Dividend distributions , Indexes , Interest rates , Securities markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Rethinking Employee Compensation,"In the author's company, they had a philosophy based on compensation studies that they would hire motivated people and pay them well. They used to have a bonus structure, but found that when employees were thinking about their compensation they never really included the bonus in their calculations. Several years later, he read Daniel Pink's book Drive, which seemed to underscore the same point. His theory is that people need to be paid fairly, but beyond that, they need autonomy and meaning. For the plan to be self-funding and accelerate growth, it doesn't kick in unless they reach a minimum dollar amount of growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This number is beyond their traditional growth rate. After they hit this target, they fund the plan. The employees receive their payout based on a combination of firm targets, personal targets, and personal evaluations.","Levin, Ross, CFP", Feature,Apr,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Motivation , Compensation , Employees , Balanced Scorecard , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Elevate Trust with Clients and Prospects,"The decision to trust or distrust someone takes just a moment. That moment -- whether it is a handshake, a telephone call, or an email -- locks in a relationship trajectory that may last for weeks, months, or even a lifetime. For financial planners, it's vital to understand trust. Trust begins and maintains successful client relationships, and distrust, in some cases, ends them. Your level of trust is changed, in many cases, by the way you share information -- that is, through conversations. Conversations trigger physical and emotional changes in your brains and bodies through altering the amounts of two of the most powerful hormones that affect social interaction: oxytocin, which enables bonding and collaboration, and testosterone, which enables your aggressive behaviors. If you build a foundation of trust to guide your interactions with clients, prospects, and peers, you'll realize higher productivity and a sustained focus on achieving extraordinary goals.","Glaser, Judith E", Feature,Apr,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Trust , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Investing in People: An Adviser's Most Important Asset,"Financial advisers know that this profession is not just a numbers business, the people make the difference. Whether a financial advisory firm is small or large, the people working there create the client experience.

If an advisory firm has felt the pain of a bad hire, there are seven steps to consider for success with new hires and existing employees: 1. Be clear about success for this role. 2. Match the ""carrots"" to business objectives. 3. Develop an interviewing strategy. 4. Know what behaviors will succeed in the role. 5. Fit candidate motivators to company motivators. 6. Ask probing questions. 7.

It is communicating without selling, a give-and-you-shall receive approach to generate interest, attract prospects, and build trust. It is a faith that sharing your knowledge and opinions will result in revenue-generating action from your audience and the eventual reward of loyal clients. Sharing free content, especially content that educates, can feel like you're revealing your secrets. Avoid overarching generalizations about financial planning when you speak or write.

Then, the rich universe of GE Capital's callable and non-callable bonds is used to quantify the yield rewards for bearing the risks of callable bonds. Upfront yield to call premiums as large as 4% and yield to maturity premiums as large as 2% are identified.

Cash value is not a bank account. 2. Unattended cash value loans can crater a policy. 3. Account value and cash value are not the same.

The Team Approach to Financial Planning for Families with Special-Needs Dependents,"Financial planning for families with special-needs dependents is characterized by unusually complex challenges. When defining special needs, disabilities cover a broad range of physical and cognitive issues, from mobility to Down's syndrome. With most special-needs diagnoses, parents must plan for partial or complete dependency extending throughout the child's lifespan. A comprehensive special-needs plan, however, must encompass far more than the family's financial aspects and legal planning matters. It must take into consideration the psychological and social issues (psychosocial) and family support needs that accompany planning for disabled dependents. This paper focuses on highlighting the differences between traditional and special-needs financial planning models. In addition, it addresses concerns of working with this complex segment of the population by encouraging planners, with practices of all sizes, to adopt a team approach that can provide the additional legal and psychosocial support required to facilitate the planning process for special-needs families.","Lauderdale, Mitzi K, JD;Huston, Sandra J, PhD", Feature,Mar,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Exceptional children , Financial planners , Differences , Dependents , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Box-checking is such an interesting activity. There's one document that most financial planners complete each year that extensively uses check boxes: Form ADV. The SEC essentially uses the boxes they check as the basis for their firms' audits. In the early days of their firm, they probably saw Form ADV as much as a marketing tool as we did a regulatory tool. If you looked at most firms' ADVs from the 1980s, lots of boxes were checked.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU", Feature,Mar,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Net present value , Cash flow , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Michelson, CEO of Private Health Management Inc. One can name many world-shaping events, including advancements in aviation, the microchip, etc. Michelson opined that the one event that most greatly affects your life and the planning delivered to clients is the increase in life expectancy. Life expectancy in the Middle Ages in Europe was skewed by high infant mortality rates, but few adults survived past age 45. Michelson theorizes that mankind has evolved over more than two million generations. Yet average life expectancy only reached 48 years by 1900. The US originates 70% of global biomedical research. Leading change is the field of genetics.

Independent Contractor or Employee?,"An increasing number of business owners are addressing their human capital needs by hiring independent contractors. Business owners benefit by avoiding the administrative hassles of employing workers and the out-of-pocket costs of payroll taxes and fringe benefits. With the jobless rate, although decreasing, still hovering around 8%, the number of people willing to work as independent contractors at reasonable rates is high. The trend toward independent contractors will likely continue as business owners cope with the insurance mandate of Pres Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by hiring contractors rather than full-time workers. Several disadvantages exist, however, when working as an independent contractor. The contractor is responsible for self-employment tax, which is a 15.3% rate rather than the 7.65% FICA rate collected from an employee, and the contractor may need to pay estimated taxes. In making the determination whether a worker is an employee, examiners usually apply a 20-factor test.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CFP®, CPA;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CFP®, CPA", Feature,Feb,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Independent contractors , Disadvantages , Trends , Human capital , Estimated taxes , Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act 2010-US , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
When an Ounce of Discretion(ary) Is Worth a Pound of Core,"Additional one-time withdrawals affect the long-term sustainability of the clients retirement income because they are drawn from the same assets that are being asked to generate income month after month, year after year. A withdrawal is a withdrawal whether it goes for regular monthly income, income tax withholding, or a one-time want. And repeated additional withdrawals, even if they don't occur every year, increase the withdrawal rate -- perhaps to an unsafe level. The problem here is that the planner has too much responsibility for the achievement of the goal (a sustainable lifetime income) and the client does not have enough. The planner can help this situation and the client by establishing some broad yet specific boundaries early on, and then empowering the client to make and be responsible for their choices.

"2 Designations, 2 Professions","When the ""Certified Financial Planner"" (CFP) designation was born, no other designation represented this new discipline called financial planning. It took a lot of courage and commitment to pioneer this designation. The insurance industry detested financial planners in the early days. In fact, they rejected financial planning. The life insurance industry lost its focus and undermined its own strength. Its strength lies in being the master of all life insurance products and services, and where that area of expertise critically fits into the holistic financial planning spectrum of an individual's life. The insurance industry decided to be a generalist instead of a specialist. It wanted to lead the orchestra rather than be a critical instrument. There is very definitive turf for the one designation that represents the financial planning profession -- the CFP certification.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP®", Commentary,Feb,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Professions , Financial planners , Certification , Life insurance , Insurance industry , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Career Asset Management: Where Wealth Is Created,"It is more challenging today for financial planners to articulate their value proposition to clients, especially if what they base their relationships on primarily consists of investment returns. The current financial planning practice standard includes investment management, estate planning, risk management, income tax planning, retirement planning, and employee benefit planning. Not included in this standard is arguably the clients' most valuable asset -- their career or human capital equity and the service called career asset management. Today it is more relevant than ever as they transition to an economy based on human capital. When viewing career as an asset, financial planners need to explore the alternatives on the continuum from not working at all to working full time until retirement. As financial planners look for opportunities to add value to the client-planner relationship, along with creating greater client wealth and overall well-being, career asset management is a logical consideration.","Haubrich, Michael P, CFP®", Cover Story,Feb,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Human capital , Careers , Asset management , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Affordable Care Act's 'Play or Pay' Tax: Determining Coverage Alternatives,"In 2014, the ""Employer Shared Responsibility Tax,"" better known as the ""play or pay"" tax of the Affordable Care Act, will take effect. The question that has been looming over employers, and especially their employees, nationwide has been whether employers will drop their employer-sponsored health care coverage and simply pay the tax penalty for doing so. Employers have the option of doing this, and sending their employee population to one of the Affordable Insurance Exchanges that have been established under the Affordable Care Act, where health care coverage will be offered to the individual and small group markets. This paper examines which employers will be subject to this new tax, how the tax is triggered, how to calculate potential employer tax liability, and under what conditions some employers will actually drop coverage or keep the employer-sponsored plans that many Americans have grown accustomed to over the past several decades.","Tacchino, Arthur, JD", Feature,Feb,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Employers , Health insurance exchanges , Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act 2010-US , Indigent care , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
A Broader Framework for Determining an Efficient Frontier for Retirement Income,"This paper outlines a different way to think about building a retirement income strategy that dramatically moves away from the concepts of safe withdrawal rates and failure rates. The focus is how to best meet two competing financial objectives for retirement: satisfying spending goals and preserving financial assets. Much of the current failure-rate framework fails to consider the retiree's entire balance sheet of income-generating assets, such as Social Security and immediate annuities; ignores lost potential enjoyment from spending more early in retirement; and ignores the magnitude and severity of ""failure."" The process described in this paper focuses on allocating assets between a portfolio of stocks and bonds, inflation-adjusted and fixed single-premium immediate annuities, and variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders. This process incorporates unique client circumstances, bases asset return assumptions on current market conditions, uses a consistent fee structure for a fair comparison between income tools, operationalizes the concept of diminishing returns from spending by incorporating a minimum-needs threshold and a lifestyle spending goal.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Feb,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Asset allocation , Social security , Retirees , Retirement planning , Annuities , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

""New"" doesn't always mean vibrant and motivated; it can mean uninformed and inexperienced in the eyes of potential clients and those who know you best. There is a professional approach for new advisers that allows them to confidently speak to any of their friends and family about their business without any of the sales stigma, using newness in the profession to the advisers' benefit. These meetings is called ""interactive surveys."" If you change your approach, you can make your meeting with any circle of influence highly interactive and professional. These meetings will take the hesitation out of contacting your relationships and showing them that you are approaching this industry as a service industry, not a sales industry. In today's climate, nothing could be more important.","Allison, Dan", Commentary,Feb,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Meetings , Client relationships , Sales prospecting , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Brain Activity Suggests Planning Designation Helps Calm Investors,"Retaining client confidence during difficult market times is often a challenge for financial planners. Previous studies have found participants under risk tend to ""offload"" financial decision making to experts. This paper extends those studies, and the findings suggest that the presence of a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) certification brings more certainty to investors during times of market underperformance. The study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to record the neural activations of participants during a stock market game. Employing four different investment strategies, the experiment compares participants' brain activity in regions associated with continued decision making and error detection when employing an adviser who does not have CFP certification versus an adviser who is a CFP certificant. Greater brain activations were associated with the use of a non-certified adviser than when relying on CFP certificants during times the adviser is underperforming the market.","James, Russell N, III, JD, PhD, CFP®", Feature,Feb,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Decision making , Certification , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Michael Branham on Unifying the Profession and Building the Next Generation of Planners,"In an interview, Michael Branham, CFP, 2013 Financial Planning Association (FPA) president, talked about his plans for his term. Branham said the first priority is for them as a board and for him as an executive leader to support Lauren Schadle, FPA's CEO, in implementing the new organizational structure related to their strategic directive. The second thing is that they've got a lot of work to do with chapters and members in integrating that same strategic directive to drive value to their members. As an organization, they've always pushed and should continue to push more high standards and principles that would ultimately benefit the end client, but also help build the credibility for the profession as a whole, which is still young. The association needs to be the place where the conversation about the transference of wisdom and skill and knowledge can take place between the generations. So the best role he can play is as facilitator of those larger conversations.","Ritchlin, Lance", Interview,Jan,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Associations , Financial planners , Presidents , Member services , United States--US , Branham, Michael",ProQuest One Academic
Examining the Benefits of Immediate Fixed Annuities in Today's Low-Rate Climate,"Immediate fixed annuities (IFA) are one of the oldest and most well-known products that can be used as a hedge against longevity risk for a retiree. Surveys show consumers like the fundamental attributes of annuities, yet a majority dislike annuities. This paper explores the potential benefits and true cost of IFAs based on various annuitization ages and scenarios. It uses two frameworks to achieve this: the internal rate of return (IRR) calculation, weighted for mortality, and a utility function. The paper first discusses the potential value of IFAs in terms of defined-contribution and defined-benefit plans. It shows that while longer life expectancies affect annuity payments, their overall impact is much less than the high correlation between bond yields and IFA rates. Using initial nominal withdrawal rates, the paper examines failure rates for straight life and period-certain IFAs for males, females, and joint couples. It finds that IRRs are similar across scenarios, but level off the longer the distribution period.","Blanchett, David M, CFP®, CLU, AIFA®, QPA, CFA", Feature,Jan,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Fixed annuities , Internal rate of return , Annuities , Pension plans",ProQuest One Academic
Who Would You Recommend?,"A recurring theme of these columns over the last several years has been that for financial planning to be considered a true profession, certain criteria needed to be in place. He often laments how difficult it is for John Q. Public to find a competent and ethical financial planner. He was reminded just how challenging it can be when he was asked by a friend for a recommendation. Two elements contributed to the difficulty he had. The first is that financial planners are terrible at marketing. The bigger contributing factor to the difficulty in searching for a financial planner is something the planning profession has been trying to address. Their regulatory structure is not conducive to helping people find competent and ethical financial help. Regulators ignore marketing that presents salespeople as advice givers. A true license could do this. The thousands of good guys and gals would benefit from the public's recognition of their accountability.","Moisand, Dan, CFP®", Commentary,Jan,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Regulation , Marketing , Licensing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How to Help Employees Better Value Stock Options as Compensation,"Employee stock options (ESOs) are often used to compensate employees other than top executives; however, ESOs are complex and not well understood by employees. In a study of 210 ESO recipients from five companies, Financial Planning found employees often value their own options based on simple mental shortcuts, or anchors, that make subjectively judging value easy, but they typically misestimate the true value of ESOs. Options are exercised in the future, so a judgment that incorporates the time value of money leads to higher quality, and often higher dollar, estimates of their value. Using actual employees subjective estimates of the value of their ESO holdings, they show companies can influence subjective variations of stock options by educating employees about valuation techniques that incorporate the time value of money In an experiment using graduate business students who value hypothetical ESOs, they demonstrate that the type of training provided to employees matters.","Convery, Susan P, PhD, CPA, CMA;Farrell, Anne M, PhD, CPA, CGMA;Krische, Susan D, PhD, CA;Sedatole, Karen L, PhD", Feature,Jan,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Compensation , Stock options , Employees , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Best Way to Get Referrals? Stop Asking for Them,"As social animals, people refer all the time. It is social currency, networking, a way to extend influence. They get psychic rewards for making good referrals to their friends. If you want to excel at attracting referrals, embrace that natural motivation. Steps in attracting referrals are presented. They are: 1. Don't Wing It, create a plan. 2. Engage clients to learn more about yourself. 3. Communicate your differences. 4. Ask you clients' advice, not their referral. Now that you have a clearer understanding of why people refer, many opportunities exist for using those motivations to build a practice that naturally attracts new clients. Take the time to synthesize that knowledge into a referral marketing plan of your own, and you will find you can attract more referrals than you ever have before without asking.","Wershing, Stephen, CFP®", Feature,Jan,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Financial planners , Referrals , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Planners Beware: ILITs Are Under Attack,"While the federal government continues running massive budgetary deficits, many politicians have proposed closing the gap by raising taxes on so-called millionaires and billionaires. However, raising marginal income tax rates is not the only path to raising taxes. Closing loopholes is another strategy. One particular tool of financial planners, the irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT), is now under attack and may become a victim of the federal government's need for revenue. Life insurance is typically used for two purposes in family situations: as a hedge against disappearing human capital, and as a means of Funding the costs of wealth transfer. The quest to close loopholes for the wealthy may increasingly burden the middle class, and in particular small business owners, who are using estate planning techniques such as ILITs to preserve the wealth they have created.

Defining Financial Planning With the 4 Factor Decision Model,"Financial planning can be defined as a profession that helps people make good decisions. Making financial decisions can be broken down to the interplay of four factors. The financial planning profession is strongly grounded in financial analysis. Money scripts should be considered in client's financial decision-making model, but they cannot be allowed to live unchecked. Emotions form the third factor in the four factor decision model. It is incumbent upon financial planners to recognize the impact emotions have on decision making and to help clients understand that impact. The fourth factor that must be considered when making financial decisions is the impact of the decision on overall wellbeing. The four factor model offers financial planners a comprehensive approach to help people make good financial decisions. Ultimately, everything they do as financial planners comes down to helping clients walk through decisions they are making.","Gehring, Nathan, CFP®", Feature,Jan,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Decision making , Client relationships , Financial analysis , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
A 'New Normal' Look at Practice Growth,"Over the past five years, the financial crisis has wreaked its havoc on the economy and consumers, and US households still have not recovered their total net worth to where it was before the crisis began. As a result, the financial planning industry too has been suffering in this new normal environment, as firms struggle to grow revenues in the midst of sluggish organic growth, rising costs, and the lack of any tailwind from markets that haven't entirely recovered to their pre-2008 highs. Given the stagnation of the asset base upon which much of the industry calculates its fees, there has been a growing trend toward alternative business and revenue models that can better facilitate growth, such as retainer fees and standalone financial planning fees. The combination of rising costs and weak revenue growth is pushing many firms to seek out greater efficiencies, and this, in turn, is fueling an urge for financial planning firms to merge in attempt to get larger with the hopes of obtaining economies of scale for the costs of running a financial planning business.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP®, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Feature,Jan,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Trends , Financial planners , Business conditions , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Achieving a Higher Safe Withdrawal Rate With the Target Percentage Adjustment,"Previous studies have evaluated portfolio withdrawal rates assuming a fixed initial withdrawal rate with inflation-adjusted increases thereafter. This study evaluates withdrawal increases zero or greater but not more than inflation. Future increases are contingent upon portfolio performance. A much higher initial withdrawal rate than previously thought possible can be achieved without increasing the probability of failure as long as the retiree reduces or eliminates the inflation increase for years indicated by the Target Percentage. The Target Percentage is developed and used to determine whether the portfolio is ahead of or behind target at any point during retirement. If the portfolio is ahead of target, the full inflation increase is taken in that year. Various adaptive withdrawal techniques that reduce or estiminate inflation increases based on portfolio metrics have been previously described by other researchers. The Target Percentage Adjustment is simpler, more flexible, more precise, and more efficient than these techniques.","Zolt, David M, CFP®, EA", Feature,Jan,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Retirement , Inflation , Portfolio performance",ProQuest One Academic
Tools for Digital Age Marketing,"Successfully marketing to a large audience of prospective clients used to require a budget beyond the reach of most financial planners. Unable to make substantial investments in marketing, planners often found themselves losing an uphill battle to the multi-million-dollar ad campaigns of brokerage firms and financial product companies. Many simply gave up and avoided marketing altogether, relying almost exclusively on referrals to grow their businesses. Today, planners can use many of the same tools and techniques employed by large companies in marketing campaigns without spending millions, or even thousands, of dollars. This article highlights various solutions you can use in the new year to attract prospects and differentiate yourself from impersonal multi-billion-dollar financial service companies.","Winterberg, Bill, CFP®", Feature,Jan,2013,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Marketing , Financial institutions , Market strategy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Divorce and Life Insurance Proceeds: Be Aware of the Law,"Divorce and life insurance present issues in financial planning that are complex and often overlooked. Based on the current divorce rate and the current amount of life insurance in effect as of 2010, the financial planner will most likely encounter at least one client affected by divorce and life insurance proceeds. It is important for financial planners to be aware of their state aw on divorce and life insurance proceeds. The reason is twofold: if the client is a beneficiary on a life insurance policy, to make sure the client gets the proceeds, and, if the client is the insured, to make sure the person the insured intends to get the proceeds does, in fact, get the proceeds. It's equally important to know what Is meant by federal preemption and how It may affect the clients receipt of life insurance proceeds or the distribution of the proceeds.","Gradisher, Suzanne M, JD;Kennedy, David R, Esq;Redle, David", Feature,Dec,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Divorce , Insurance policies , Life insurance",ProQuest One Academic
"Financial Planning: Do Ask, Do Tell","The financial planning profession should instate a ""do ask, do tell"" policy to encourage meaningful conversations with clients. This policy challenges financial planners to courageously address biases and deficiencies that prohibit in-depth analysis of a client's situation. Asking engaging questions that inspire clients to share their life journeys and listening intently to their responses promotes a productive financial planning engagement. Clients come to financial planners battered by economic circumstances that leave them uncertain about many aspects of their lives. Financial planners who focus solely on the numbers drive an obsession that some magical return, account balance, and income stream will improve a clients quality of life. Financial planners should discuss these facts and figures within the framework of the client's current circumstances and envisioned future. Financial planners can help clients understand key factors when considering a transition to a more fulfilling position.","Braxton, Lazetta Rainey, CFP", Feature,Dec,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Clients , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Retirement Planning Advice in the Workplace Now a Possibility?,"A couple of months ago, the author went to the optometrist at the new Costco in Ann Arbor, MI, because his eyesight had changed so much he could tell it was time for new lenses.

"Reciprocity Is a Virtue, But Maybe Not in Estate Planning!","What is commonly known as the reciprocal trust doctrine (also sometimes referred to as the cross trust doctrine) was first articulated by the Service in Lehman v. Comm'r, 109 F2d 99 (2nd Cir 1940), where two brothers created irrevocable trusts for each other. Each trust provided that the trustee was to pay the income to the other brother for life, with remainder to that brother's issue. Each brother transferred substantially identical stocks and bonds into the trust for the other brother. When the first brother died, the IRS ""uncrossed"" the trusts, finding that each trust was the quid pro quo for the other. As a result, the deceased brother was treated as if he had created the trust for his benefit, with the result that the trust was includable in his gross estate under the predecessor to IRC section 2036(a)(1), which includes property transferred with a retained life estate.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Feature,Dec,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Irrevocable trusts , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

When these windows close depends on Congress. If your clients have been contemplating these strategies, now may be the time to implement them.

Determining Retirement Readiness,"With so many unknowns, analyzing retirement readiness goes well beyond simple arithmetic. It's no longer enough to merely enter retirement earnings. Two techniques that increase the usefulness of retirement analysis are the Monte Carlo method and scenario analysis. The Monte Carlo technique creates multiple iterations of a particular scenario and yields a likelihood of success. Scenario analysis allows one to modify the inputs to the Monte Carlo analysis to create alternative situations, each with its own success rate. Most financial planning software packages offer Monte Carlo simulations, and many permit scenario analysis as well. The process of creating, implementing, and tracking a retirement plan, as with any financial plan, not only increases the odds of success, but also gives both client and adviser piece of mind. Periodic updates also help clients stay on track when markets misbehave.","Waltzer, Ken, MD, MPH, AIF, CFA, CFP", Feature,Dec,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Retirement , Software packages , Earnings , Success , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The study required advisers to anonymously disclose the percent of their clients in retirement who in the past 12 months became re-employed, significantly adjusted their lifestyle due to economic conditions, or made no significant changes to their retirement status or lifestyle. Advisers who experienced less success were likely to be using an essential-versus-discretionary income approach.

Transition Through Old Age in a Dynamic Retirement Distribution Model,Past research on the topic of sustainable withdrawal rates has primarily focused on longer distribution periods that apply to younger retirees. This research project seeks to answer the following questions regarding superannuation (continuing to survive and live into very old ages). 1. What does the withdrawal rate profile need to look like for a retiree who survives into extreme old age? 2. What should the withdrawal rate sequence be to sustain portfolio values sufficient to continue cash flows from old retirement ages throughout superannuation? Equity allocations above 50% cause an allocation volatility drag on optimal withdrawal rates. High cash flows early in retirement deplete portfolio values and reduce cash flows during later retirement years. This paper develops a longevity-based methodology to rationally restrain the early age withdrawals to improve portfolio survivability later in retirement with transition between the two stages in the mid-70s.,"Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP;Mitchell, John B, DBA;Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,Dec,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Asset allocation , Portfolio investments , Superannuation , Retirees , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

She went on to tell why she wanted to retire and why she had come to see the financial planners. Having had no history with her, they could not be sure that she was really serious about retiring, that this was not a case of blowing off steam. Their first job was to discuss goals in general. She wanted to assume no further job-related income and generally to retain her current lifestyle. With the preliminary numbers confirmed and assumptions agreed upon, they ran calculations to determine her projected level of financial independence. As many financial advisers know, probability analysis adds depth to the calculations.

Tax Uncertainty Déjà vu All Over Again? It Depends,"The first step to untangling emotion from analysis is to break down the facts about the tax laws. It's helpful to keep in mind what you know about current legislation and possible future legislation. A taxpayer must be willing to work with their adviser to project, as accurately as possible, the amounts of income, deductions, exemptions, and credits (by category) that they expect to report in the current year; these numbers will serve as a foundation for identifying tax-planning opportunities.

Stephanie Kelton on Getting Past Our Oversimplified Understanding of Money,"In an interview, Stephanie Kelton, chair of the Department of Economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City research scholar at the Levy Economics Institute, talked about getting past oversimplified understanding of money. In the modern era, money is created not by going out and finding physical things, but by entering into credit relations, entering into contracts that are based on credit, and money is created essentially out of thin air. When ask what are the policy recommendations of modern money theory, his personal position is to allow the private sector to come as close as it can to achieving full employment. That's the goal for any macro economist. You want to see an economy that operates at its potential. Any economy can be examined by looking at three sectors: the domestic private sector, the domestic public sector, and the foreign sector. Money flows within and between those sectors.","Corbin, Mary K", Interview,Nov,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Theory , Monetary policy , Money , United States--US , Kelton, Stephanie",ProQuest One Academic

How Clients' Money Scripts Predict Their Financial Behaviors,"  It is common knowledge that psychological traits may interfere with the financial planning process. This study examines the association between money scripts and disordered money behaviors. By identifying the association between money scripts and financial behaviors, practitioners can quickly identify clients who may be at risk for disordered money behaviors based on an assessment of their money scripts. To further assist planners in identifying problematic money scripts and behaviors among their clients, the authors tested the association among respondents' profession and their financial psychological profile. Money scripts, a term coined by financial psychologists Brad Klontz and Ted Klontz, are core beliefs about money that drive financial behaviors. When money scripts are developed in response to an emotionally charged, dramatic, or traumatic personal, family, or cultural financial flashpoint, money scripts can become resistant to change, even when they are self-destructive.","Klontz, Bradley T, PsyD, CFP;Britt, Sonya L, PhD, CFP", Feature,Nov,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Psychological aspects , Financial planning , Correlation analysis",ProQuest One Academic
Succession Planning: A NexGenner's Perspective,"Despite the volume of attention succession planning gets, it is rarely visited from the young planner's point of view. Right off the bat, a targeted successor views a business through a very different lens than someone beginning to plan a transition. They may have significant changes they would like to undertake with the firm to prepare it for the next 20, 30, even 40 years, while the existing owner sees a relatively short time horizon to maximize or maintain their firm's value before walking away. Young planners often do not realize the magnitude of the changes they are asking for, particularly when there is no guarantee those changes will actually have a positive impact. The closer your business matches your successor's vision, the more they will be willing to pay for it. After all, people are willing to pay more for something they want, rather than what you want.","Pitzl, Joe, CFP", Commentary,Nov,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Young adults , Succession planning , Willingness to pay , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Confounding Nature of Policy Maturities,"Explaining the implications of when and how a permanent life insurance policy matures can seem like Abbott and Costello's ""Who's on First"" routine for clients. But it is information clients need to understand to make informed decisions regarding their permanent life insurance. Proper management of a policy depends on understanding how a policy matures, other than death. But this isn't one-size-fits all. How a policy matures depends on the type of policy. Many universal life (UL) policies sold in the 1980s and early 1990s have age-95 maturities. However, unlike participating whole life, UL funding (target premiums) is the responsibility of the policy owner, and without astute management, this funding always gets messed up. As presented by life insurance agents, policies may seem quite simple. But for many types of policies, complexity is a given. Among the complexities is properly managing a policy's maturity. This can be handled with experience, good sense, and patience.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Commentary,Nov,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Maturity , Universal life , Insurance policies , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Key to the Profession,"The transactional model has been used by insurance and securities regulators for over 70 years. It's based on rules that can be proven to have been followed, or not. But financial planning is not merely a transaction; it is data gathering, it is analysis, it is advice, it is experienced judgment, it is a professional relationship. For financial planning to ever actually be regulated, the focus also will have to be on a standard of care and on process, not merely transactions. Ironically, that was the original intent almost 20 years ago when Financial Planning Practice Standards were conceived. They took seven years to develop, but were then pretty much put on the shelf. These standards hold the key to moving forward with any meaningful regulation of financial planners and, more importantly, in causing financial planning to be recognized by the public as a profession.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU", Commentary,Nov,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Professional practice , Professional standards , Regulation of financial institutions , Professional relationships , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How Skittish Are Bond Fund Investors?,"Given that the 10-year Treasury yield is at 1.68% (as of September 6), it's a reasonable expectation that interest rates are more likely to go up instead of down in the future. High-yield bond fund investors appear to have a steady focus on performance throughout all sorts of different economic and interest-rate environments. Intermediate-bond fund flows are a more nuanced and confusing story. The full period correlation of 0.10 indicates an extremely mild positive correlation. High-yield returns have been correlated with equity returns in the past. When rates rise, if they are accompanied by a rise in stock prices, it wouldn't be surprising if the final impact on flows is more muted. It's not obvious how to empirically test these propositions, but given the variability in the sub-period results and the low correlation over the full period, it is hard to draw anything definitive from these numbers.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA", Commentary,Nov,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Correlation analysis , Bonds , Interest rates , Rates of return , Bond funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Optimal Portfolio Allocations with GMWB Annuities,"The debate surrounding the potential benefits of variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit riders (GMWB annuities) is alive and well. At the surface, there appears to be a great deal of disagreement about whether or not these products are viable approaches to generating retirement income or are simply a ""money illusion"" created by ""actuaries gone wild."" This paper will explore the potential benefit of a GMWB annuity from a total portfolio perspective, both at retirement for income generation as well as before retirement as an accumulation vehicle. The expected net cost of GMWB annuities will be reviewed, and a utility function assuming constant relative risk aversion based on total income replacement during retirement is employed to determine the optimal combination of a GMWB within a portfolio based on varying levels of pension income (for example, Social Security) and target withdrawal initial rates.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,Oct,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Advantages , Withdrawals , Retirement planning , Annuities , Portfolio management , Variable annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Safe Withdrawal Rates: What Do We Really Know?,"Recently, the Journal of Financial Planning interviewed prominent experts on safe retirement withdrawal rates to discover where they agree, where they disagree, and where the discussion is going. Participants included William P. Bengen, CFP; Jonathan T. Guyton, CFP; and Wade D. Pfau, PhD, CFA. On what they consider to be the safe withdrawal rate, Bengen said you have to make a lot of qualifications, (whether) it's for a portfolio of 30 years' duration that's tax-deferred, and so on. He's still using 4.5% because he hasn't seen anything that would endanger that yet, although the possibility of that occurring may be in the future. Whether a 4% withdrawal rate is relevant for complex real-world client siuations, Guyton thinks that it's one of the best tools they have, although he'd qualify it by saying that every retiree has a core element of their spending that needs to be maintained and sustained throughout the length of their retirement.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Feature,Oct,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement , Financial planners , Withdrawals , Rates , United States--US , Bengen, William P , Guyton, Jonathan T , Pfau, Wade D",ProQuest One Academic

A Tale of Two Transitions,"They can be the best of times; they can be the worst of times. They are the transitions experienced by parents and young adults in the process of moving from financial dependence to financial autonomy. Life planning facilitates these transitions and the reorganization of relationships they frequently require. As William Bridges, author of The Way of Transition: Embracing Life's Most Difficult Moments, points out, it is important not to confuse change with transition. Change is a shift in your situation: you move to a new home, get a promotion, buy a new car. A transition, on the other hand, is the process of letting go of the way things have been and taking hold of the new way they are becoming. In between letting go of the old and taking hold of the new, there is a chaotic interim zone where things are not the way they used to be but also not yet the way they are going to be.","Gallo, Eileen, PhD", Feature,Oct,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Transitions , Differences , Financial planners , Parents & parenting , Children & youth , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Adventures in Advising the Millennial Retiree,"It's a financial nightmare of nearly every retiree -- not to mention their financial planner -- that, despite their careful planning and adherence to the tenets of safe withdrawal rate research, their retirement date will turn out to be that ""perfect storm"" distribution period that ultimately runs out of money. And it has been suggested that by following a static withdrawal strategy with annual inflation adjustments and rebalancing, the millennial retirement date of January 2000 could ultimately be just that scenario. Historical analyses must be careful not to place undue advantage on hindsight. That said, the author believes that revisiting the millennial retirement and examining the combined impact of key safe withdrawal research published since then can be both illuminating and build confidence. The use of recent empirically based dynamic allocation and withdrawal policies have had a significant and stabilizing impact on the challenging case of the millennial retiree -- at least thus far.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP", Feature,Oct,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Millennials , Retirees , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Usually, people first consult financial planners during significant life transitions like marriages, divorces, inheritances, buying or selling businesses, and retirement. The key words here are ""appropriate education."" Appropriate sharing of your own money stories -- including, ironically, some of your mistakes -- can help build trust.

One of the main points he makes in his book, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow,"" is that subjective confidence that people experience in what they think and they believe they know is not really a judgment. It is not a judgment of the likelihood that they're right. It is not an evaluation of the quality of the evidence that they have. Confidence is a feeling, and it's a feeling that comes, basically, from the coherence of the story that you're telling yourself. The real enemy, he thinks, of wealth accumulation is loss aversion.

A Decision Model for Non-Qualified Stock Options,"This paper analyzes various strategies for an individual who holds a non-qualified stock option and desires to maximize the amount of after-tax wealth generated by the option. Stock prices are volatile. Most option pricing models use the stock's volatility as a key factor in the pricing model. The model described in this paper implicitly takes volatility into account by asking the executive to predict the highest stock price that will be achieved within the option holding period. The model also requires the executive to predict the return on an alternative investment that the executive would consider making if the executive were to cash out some or all of their options today. This approach can be used in conjunction with a volatility-based option pricing model. Unless otherwise noted, the model assumes that the executive will exercise options by surrendering option shares.","Ballentine, Roy C, ChFC, CLU, CFP", Feature,Oct,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Decision making models , Studies , Mathematical models , Stock options , Volatility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Bringing Real Clarity of Cash Value Life Insurance to the Marketplace,"This article provides a process or approach financial planners and their clients can use to make better decisions about life insurance policies, especially regarding cash value or permanent life insurance policies. Currently used sales illustrations do not readily provide the necessary framework or adequate information for assessing life insurance policies. The paper introduces an informative illustration format, one built on the structure or mechanics of life insurance policies, that is, that policies comprise streams of annual costs and rates of return. This approach facilitates policy comprehension and emphasizes the need for relevant financial performance information. This perspective is then used to compare historical performance of traditional whole life policies and to evaluate such policies with the alternative of buying term and investing the difference. By clarifying all policies, this educational approach brings new understanding to the marketplace, and thereby contains all the inherent possibilities, such as better value for clients and more opportunities for agents and planners to demonstrate greater expertise and provide superior service.","Fechtel, R Brian, CFA", Feature,Sep,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Insurance policies , Life insurance , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Tax Deferral: When Does It Make Sense and When Does It Cost Cents (or Dollars)?,"Most of you have absorbed the belief that tax deferral is always better than paying current taxes. That can be true if certain assumptions are met: tax rates are uniform across income types and constant over time, and the client's personal discount rate is lower than the expected rate of return on the assets. Given current tax rates, the compounding benefit of deferral is largely, but not totally, offset by the shifting of long-term gain to ordinary income. This paper explores various client tax situations involving different asset classes and vehicles, and provides guidelines based on analyses of multiple scenarios to determine when tax deferral makes financial sense and when it doesn't.","Silk, Roger D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Sep,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Deferred income taxes , Tax rates , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

This paper addresses the authors' experience with TTT and how they confirmed their belief that there is nothing they know today that can help predict the short-term future -- market timing simply does not work. However, they learned that fundamental factors can be used to shape their expectations regarding the intermediate to long term.

"What Makes Something an Alternative Asset Class, Anyway?","The most typical definition of an asset class is a group of securities that have similar risk/return characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. Thus, for instance, stocks, bonds, and cash represent the three most common asset classes, as each has different risk/return characteristics and behaves very differently in response to various economic and market events. One of the most common ways to determine whether an investment represents a unique asset class is to examine its correlation with other investments. Given how modern portfolio theory demonstrates that investments with a low correlation to the rest of the portfolio can lower the overall volatility of the portfolio -- even if the underlying investment itself is volatile -- advisers have increasingly sought out low correlation ""alternative"" asset classes and investments to manage risk through diversification.

Alternative Asset Replication in Traditional Vehicles: How Authentic Can It Be?,"Today, mutual funds created to mimic ""alternative"" investments (usually private equity, other hedge fund strategies, real estate, and commodities) popularized by the so-called ""Yale model"" are readily available to retail investors and, at least conceptually, provide excellent opportunities for individual investors. They have the added benefits of lower fees than hedge funds, greater transparency and daily liquidity. In 1991, 53% of Yale's endowment was committed to US stocks, bonds, and cash; today, barely 10% is devoted to domestic marketable securities with only 4% in fixed income. Initially, alternative strategies were primarily accessible through hedge funds, usually in the form of limited partnerships, meaning that investors had to have a lot of money to qualify. The use of the mutual fund structure itself for alternatives suggests an inherent dissonance.

The Extended Influence of 'Safe Withdrawal Rate' Research,"The financial planning literature has seen a flurry of recent research into the safe withdrawal rate (SWR). The SWR is the maximum initial percentage of a client's invested assets that can be spent as a constant standard of living (resulting in a dollar amount that is subsequently inflation-adjusted regardless of market performance) without running out of money when tested over any historical market scenario. Most planners use some version of a lifetime cash-flow projection (LCP), with Monte Carlo simulation, to evaluate the viability of each of their clients' financial plans. The LCP is a very powerful planning tool, and one that resonates well with clients. The conceptual advances in approach that SWR studies have introduced in recent years provide a blueprint for client to make each of these LCP features more flexible and realistic. Clients have choices. They should, accordingly, allow the LCP model to incorporate rules-based decision making by the client as events play out.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFA, CFP, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP", Feature,Sep,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Research , Clients , Decision making , Financial planners , Monte Carlo simulation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

A Framework for Finding an Appropriate Retirement Income Strategy,"Even though retirement distribution is the most actively researched area in the world of financial planning, the profession still lacks a comprehensive analysis framework for comparing retirement distribution strategies. Such a framework should do an apples-to-apples comparison among various retirement distribution strategies such as the appropriate time to claim Social Security or the use of systematic portfolio withdrawals in combination with fixed annuities, variable annuities, and bond adders. The proposed framework in this paper includes two reward and three risk metrics. The widely used metric of probability of success is complemented with two additional risk metrics: a view into what happens when the plan fails and the amount of income generated from fixed sources of cash flow. The proposed reward metrics are retirement income and average legacy.","Malhotra, Manish", Feature,Aug,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Risk management , Retirement income",ProQuest One Academic

The Age Wave Revisited,"With the leading edge of boomers reaching age 66 in 2012 and the trailing edge marking age 48, the impact on retirement and health issues and strained safety nets is becoming obvious as US at large -- and families and individuals -- grapple with tax and debt issues. In an article in Financial Advisor magazine, adviser Bill Bengen took another look at the well-quoted 4% rule. With volatile markets, retirement planners continue to seek ""the number"" -- the ideal withdrawal rate from a portfolio most likely to sustain income over one's lifetime (and that of a surviving spouse for married persons). At a time of heightened investor nervousness, low interest rates, and inflationary threats, boomer angst is fodder for creative, empathetic, and fiduciary-based life planning counseling. Holistic and future-focused financial planning is coming into its own, and is integral to boomer peace of mind and financial survival.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CRC", Feature,Aug,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Baby boomers , Interest rates , Retirement planning , Volatility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Facing the Fiscal Cliff,"""Taxmageddon,"" screamed the headline from the Washington Post. Economists say it threatens to pull the economy back into recession. On Jan 1, 2013, the US economy will experience the biggest tax increases in its history, coupled with significant spending cuts all unless Congress acts to stop it. You may remember the prequel when Congress extended the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts the first time, Dec 17, 2010, days before they were set to expire. That move bought a two-year respite. In the meantime the problem has gotten worse. As before, people face the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the alternative minimum tax patch, dozens of so-called tax extenders, and several provisions intended to stimulate the economy -- such as the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment benefits.","Hinch, Phillips", Feature,Aug,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Alternative minimum tax , Tax cuts , Cost reduction , Recessions , Tax increases , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Regulating Trustee Emotions and Their Compliance with Financial Objectives,"In the best of all worlds, the tools and techniques that parents provide children would include a financial rule book that allows them to regulate their behavior with money as adults. In the real world, this is not always the case. And estate planners are often confronted with the need to prepare trusts in situations where the next generation is, to be charitable, financially immature. One of the problems with earlier attempts to use trusts to motivate beneficiaries to manage money responsibly was the failure to describe the desired results in operational and objective terms. They suggested that part of creating a financial skills trust is to ask the client to describe what each of these skills would look like to him or her in day-to-day life and to use the client's input to describe them in operational terms. Highly automated tools and special services such as banking and debt management are used.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Feature,Aug,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Motivation , Debt management , Client relationships , Trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Women and Disability Risks,"One of the biggest financial gaps in Americans' portfolio of investment and protection holdings is protection against the financial consequences of becoming disabled and not being able to work for a considerable time. This is a prevalent risk, far more common than most people realize. The Social Security Administration estimates that one in four of today's 20-year-olds will become disabled before they retire. Importantly, there is strong evidence that many financial advisers are not expending enough effort to educate their clients on the risks of disability or putting a plan in place to mitigate their financial impact. These gaps are especially pronounced among women, who are more likely to become disabled, more receptive to planning, and more receptive to transferring risk to insurance.","Greenwald, Mathew, PhD;Quist-Newins, Mary, CFP, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Aug,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Disability , Client relationships , Risk management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The observations and best practices that emerge are intended to assist the financial planning community at large, regardless of the CFP professional's business model or compensation structure. There were a number of best practices that were not met -- most importantly, a written scope of engagement, which is now a requirement in a financial planning relationship.

Three years ago PIMCO came out with what they called the ""new normal"" thesis, which was that leading up to the financial crisis the US economy really grew by adding leverage, adding debt to the economy, which drove up asset prices and GDP growth. His best estimate is that the tax cuts will get extended, but there will likely be a lot of brinkmanship up until that decision and a lot of uncertainty, which will make it very difficult for individuals and for financial planners and for businesses to make long-term investment decisions.","Nelson, Christina", Interview,Aug,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Economic crisis , Tax cuts , Executives , United States--US , Kashkari, Neel",ProQuest One Academic
Being a Professional Means Being There for Our Clients,"When the author started in the business in 1982, financial planners or wealth managers were not the trusted adviser for most clients. Attorneys and accountants were counselors who provided objective and, at times, integrated advice. Many of them in their industry were providing products that fit the frame which they were given-tax shelters for the client who wished to pay less in taxes, life insurance for those who wanted to make sure their family was protected, and stocks or mutual funds for those willing to bet on an economic expansion that did not yet exist. They generally were the plumbers who were there to fix the problem. Here are several ways in which they can hold firmly to their position: 1. They need to be wise and smart. 2. They need to be with their clients. 3. They need to be in this together. 4.

Standby Reverse Mortgages: A Risk Management Tool for Retirement Distributions,"This study considers using an HECM Saver reverse mortgage as a risk management tool in conjunction with a two-bucket investment strategy, coined the standby reverse mortgage strategy (or SRM), in order to increase the probability a client will be able to meet predetermined retirement goals. The HECM Saver has unique and attractive features including lower cost; a non-cancellable line of credit: the borrower's control over when, and if, he or she uses the line of credit; and a line that can be paid back at any time without a penalty. The SRM represents an additional source of readily available cash in a bucket strategy to draw upon when clients' portfolio values deviate substantially from their expected glidepath (where their portfolio should be relative to their capital needs analysis). Monte Carlo simulations were performed using real withdrawal rates of 4%, 5%, and 6%; a home value of $250,000; and a portfolio value of $500,000.","Salter, John, PhD, CFP, AIFA;Pfeiffer, Shaun;Evensky, Harold, CFP, AIF", Feature,Aug,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Lines of credit , Reverse mortgages , Risk management , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Financial Planning Roadmap for Non-traditional Couples,"Despite recent changes in many states allowing same-sex marriage, the preparation of a sound financial plan for non-traditional couples continues to be more complicated than for traditional couples. To provide the best financial plan to clients, advisers must be aware of the complex financial and legal issues facing same-sex couples. Two individuals who are ""married"" receive beneficial treatment in several financial areas as compared to two unmarried individuals who form a household. Marriage is not defined at the state level where federal law applies. Under the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), same-sex couples are viewed as unrelated parties, not as a married couple.

The Impact of the Broker-Dealer Fiduciary Standard on Financial Advice,"Financial advisers provide expert assistance selecting financial instruments for retail customers. Registered representatives of broker-dealers facilitate the sale of securities and often provide financial advice to clients who are less knowledgeable about the product. This imbalance of information has led to the imposition of a legal fiduciary standard when an informed agent is hired to make decisions on behalf of a less-informed client (Frankel 1983). In the absence of an informational imbalance between registered representatives (or brokers) and their customers, the primary service provided through broker-dealers is to sell retail financial products demanded by the customer. The difference in regulation between investment advisers and brokers affects the market for financial advice. The sale of professional advisory services to a less-informed client involves significant potential agency costs that exist when the interests of the client and broker/adviser are not perfectly aligned.","Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP®;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP®, CFA", Feature,Jul,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Client relationships , Insurance agents & brokers , Affluence , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The newer crop of advertisements are healthy indicators that large financial firms are finally seeing an important truth: the achievement of important financial goals isn't accomplished by either gaining unfair advantage or randomly throwing money at an investment product du jour, and just hoping you have enough in order to retire.

But many of these products share some common characteristics that are not found in traditional marked-to-market products.

How to Stay Safe When Using the Cloud,"The cloud is quickly weaving its way into the fabric of financial planners' technology infrastructure. Subscribing to services delivered exclusively through the Internet can yield a variety of benefits, but many planners remain concerned about the security of information stored in the cloud. If due diligence isn't performed on a cloud provider's security practices, private and confidential information about clients, planners, or even the firm itself may be compromised and exploited by intruders. One can reasonably identify individuals responsible for the security of computers, servers, and software applications physically located in a financial planning firm, including the data and information stored within them. Whenever possible, use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and HTTPS connections for Web-based tools, advises Brad Burgess, director of software development for Orion Advisor Services LLC, a back-office portfolio service bureau for financial planners. Before planners start storing clients' personal information on cloud services, Burgess advises that planners request and review a provider's corporate security documents.","Winterberg, Bill, CFP®", Feature,Jul,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Cloud computing , Data integrity , Confidentiality , Security management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Defining Incapacity in the Modern Estate Plan,"The modern estate plan includes a: revocable living trust, pour-over will, durable power of attorney for financial matters, durable power of attorney for health care, living will, assignment of personal property to the trust, deeds of real estate to the trust, and certification of trust. The client must have capacity to execute these legal documents. Otherwise, the validity of the documents could be questioned by heirs and the courts. A higher standard, the capacity to enter a contract, is generally required to execute a revocable living trust. This standard describes much higher cognitive function than needed to sign a will. Some individuals who want to remain in control as long as possible or who are concerned about others making decisions for them prefer a conservative standard, whereas others who have been in long-term relationships and are confident in their decision makers are comfortable with an easier process.

What It Really Means to Use Alternatives in Portfolios,"The author spend a lot of time talking with advisers about using alternative investments in client portfolios. Over time, the author have found that the first step in any conversation is to define what alternatives means. The term has evolved quite a bit over the years. Not that long ago, alternatives might have meant emerging markets. Now common, the asset class was not always so well understood; it was perceived as risky and scary by many clients and advisers. Most asset classes have been pretty well explored and colonized. There are stock and bond funds that specialize in what are now called frontier markets. Once you get into Yemen, for example, you've pretty much hit the limits of diversification. Likewise, size classes have largely been explored, with company sizes down to micro-cap and all sorts of splits in size, industry, style, and what have you. Weird and scary or not, the success of alternatives lies in their contribution to the risk-adjusted returns of your clients portfolios.","McMillan, Brad, CFA, CAIA, MAI, AIF®", Commentary,Jun,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Alternatives , Emerging markets , Asset allocation , Portfolio investments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Financial Planning: A Look from the Outside In,"Economics offers a full body of knowledge about securing lifetime financial security for an individual that, oddly, is not incorporated into their financial planning body of knowledge. The theory, known as the Bodie Merton Samuelson theory of life-cycle saving and investing (LCSI), has been well settled in the economic literature since at least the 1970's. LCSI further focuses on optimizing earned income, matching investment risk to goals, and optimizing spending over one's lifetime. These are the core planning tasks in the LCSI theoretical model. If human capital is the primary determinant of long-term financial well-being, then a corollary is that human capital also needs to be managed, cultivated, and protected. The emphasis on human capital in the LCSI theory also positions life planning as central to the advisory mission. Life planning focuses on values clarification and goal specification and thus, like LCSI theory, puts the individual as the focus of attention.","Hogan, Paula H, CFP®, CFA", Feature,Jun,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Human capital , Economic theory , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
You Must Know How to 'Sell' to Develop Your Business,"One void in many financial planners' skill sets is the ability to convince someone they should use you instead of the planner across town. One reality about clients relates to their comfort zones. When you first start to work with them they are most likely ""sifting"" right in the middle of their comfort zones. That presents a problem to you, the planner, because clients will likely have to expand their comfort zones to reach their goals. One of the most critical tasks you have is to expand a client's comfort zone to include what is needed to realize his or her goals. At least four actions will accomplish this: 1. education, 2. participation, 3. visioning, and 4. building trust. Combining proven sales processes with these proven client concepts will help you obtain and keep clients.

Going to One: Is Diversification Passé?,"Recent market highs have not begun to erase earlier market lows from investor consciousness. On Oct 8, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a high of 14,903 only to tumble relentlessly to a low of 6547 Mar 9, 2009, for a gut-wrenching decline of -54% in less than 18 months. With no place to hide at the time, traditional market lore offered satirical consolation -- the only thing that goes up in a down market is correlations. Testing this lore, the FPA 2012 Trends in Investing study asked advisers whether their correlation assumptions/figures for asset classes used in asset allocation changed since 2008. This split reflects the broader theoretical war, ignited by the 2008 bear market, over modern portfolio theory and its siblings: the efficient market hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation promises a longer-term portfolio compound return that is higher than the weighted-average compound returns of the asset classes used to build the portfolio.","Grote, Jim, CFP®", Cover Story,Jun,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Efficient markets , Asset allocation , Capital assets , Portfolio diversification , Market prices , Securities markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Integrated Tail Risk Hedging: The Last Line of Defense in Investment Risk Management,"There is no lack of techniques to protect portfolios from tail risk, and there has been a proliferation of new products since the market collapse of 2008. Most of these have unacceptably excessive costs due to high fees, underperformance during normal markets, and/or limits to upside portfolio potential. The area of designing tail risk hedging strategies is quite young and currently experiencing a burst of growth and creativity. A number of portfolio protection techniques work beautifully over the very short term, if you know exactly when to use them and when to stop. A risk management technique that has had a surge in popularity is a variable annuity that provides a guaranteed minimum benefit.

Living into a Firm's Name,"The firm's name offers a window into the firm's ethos. The origin of the name reinforces the firm's purpose and gives the world a compelling reason to engage the firm. A trusting financial planner-client relationship develops when the firm demonstrates who it says it is by name and confirms its name through action. Living into a name is an important concept for many cultures. For instance, some traditional African and Asian families spend several ceremonial days reflecting upon the name of a newborn child. Living into a firm's name also involves regenerative processes that keep the firm's transactions aligned with its mission and beliefs. Many financial planning firms extend their surname to their commercial offspring. In this case, the firm's persona should represent a living manifestation of the founder's guiding principles. This naming technique leverages relationships with those who are familiar with the founder.

Although not widely discussed across the profession, FPA's latest Trends in investing study reveals that the rise of tactical asset allocation has quietly but steadily been under way and in fact now constitutes the majority investing style. Regardless of how it is implemented, the trend toward tactical itself appears to have grown from a broad dissatisfaction among planners and their clients that the lost decade of equity returns has left many clients lagging their retirement goals.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP®, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC", Feature,Jun,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Trends , Theory , Asset allocation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
From Best Return to Safety and Liquidity: A 5-year look at trends in investing,"For the past five years, FPA's annual Trends in Investing study has sought to gauge the investing products and strategies used by advisers, and data from those studies illustrate how investing trends bend and shape with time, particularly in response to economic conditions. The 2008 FPA Trends in Investing study showed that while nearly 70% of advisers were using individual stocks in client portfolios, only 52% were using cash and equivalents. The 2009 study results revealed that advisers were indeed changing with the economic times. Gone were the days of seeking out the best return. Instead, advisers were now seeking out the best risk-adjusted return. The 2010 study results demonstrated that advisers were also more confident in their current asset allocation strategies. The 2011 study demonstrated consistent growth over the prior four years among ETFs, alternative investments, REITs, and permanent life insurance products. The 2012 Trends in Investing study shows the first noticeable slide in adviser use of cash and equivalents.","Schulaka, Carly", Feature,Jun,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Trends , Investment products , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Sustainable Withdrawal Rates: The Historical Evidence on Buffer Zone Strategies,"The decumulation discussion involves four variables: 1. the amount of assets at retirement, 2. the optimal asset allocation, 3. the initial withdrawal rate, and 4. the withdrawal strategy. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as the correct or optimal answer to what each of these four variables should be. When evaluating different strategies, a common metric is the portfolio success rate, which is the percentage of times a particular decumulation strategy sustains a time-series of real withdrawals. Some financial planners advocate the use of buffer zones -- the use of money market funds to ensure the safety of withdrawals -- as a component of a decumulation portfolio. This paper examines four strategies involving the use of buffer zones and a variety of withdrawal rates, and compares the success of each strategy to the success of a traditional withdrawal strategy.","Woerheide, Walter, PhD, ChFC, CFP;Nanigian, David, PhD", Feature,May,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Success , Time series , Withdrawals , Asset allocation , Money markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Interface Between Continuing-Care Retirement Communities and Long-Term-Care Insurance,"Financial advisers help clients plan for age-related risks such as a potential need for long-term care, where this care might be obtained, and how it will be funded.

Perhaps lesser known are the connections between CCRCs and LTCI, and why it is necessary to consider them in concert when planning.

Risk Tolerance Questions to Best Determine Client Portfolio Allocation Preferences,"The literature on risk tolerance overwhelmingly justifies the use of questionnaires based on validity and reliability or psychometric testing, but there has been little research examining the relation between questions and actual investor portfolio behavior. This study examines risk tolerance questions based on economic theory, prospect theory, and client self-assessment to determine the extent to which they explain variation in portfolio allocation preference and recent investment changes. The authors conclude that risk tolerance questions based on loss aversion and self-assessment should be used when determining the portfolio allocation of clients. While questions based on economic theory should theoretically be the best measure of a client's portfolio allocation preference, the results of this study indicate that these questions are not very useful when both loss aversion and self-assessment questions are included in a risk tolerance questionnaire. Planners should begin to reassess the risk tolerance level of their clients around age 60.","Guillemette, Michael A;Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP;Gilliam, John, PhD, CFP, CLU", Feature,May,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Studies , Quantitative psychology , Economic theory , Risk assessment , Preferences , Self evaluation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How Washington Is Killing Deferred Annuities,"Deferred annuities have held a valued place in retirement portfolios for decades. Unfortunately, the benefits of deferred annuities will decline next year. Changing tax laws resulting from recent legislative enactments, as well as recent failures to enact legislation, are making deferred annuities less beneficial. Financial planners should be extremely diligent in evaluating deferred annuities (annuities), especially for high-income clients. And ""high income"" may not be what you think it is. Annuities have long been a favored product for providing retirement income largely because of the benefits of income-tax deferral. Like all financial products, annuity contracts are valuable tools for meeting client goals and objectives when used in the right circumstances. The pending tax changes that take effect Jan 1, 2013, make annuity contracts a bit less attractive for high-income taxpayers and taxpayers who will become high-income taxpayers in the future.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA", Feature,May,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Retirement , High income , Annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

While in China last summer, people learned of the punishment for a man arrested a mere 10 days earlier for petty theft from a few cars in a parking garage. He was executed. Back home, less than a month later, they in Central Florida played host to the circus that was the Casey Anthony trial. As the whole world knows, she walks free today while many people believe she murdered her own daughter, put duct tape over the little girl's mouth, and dumped the child's body in the woods down the street.

Seeking Alternatives to Long-Term-Care Insurance,"One of the biggest challenges many advisers face is preparing their clients for long-term-care needs, which can wind up being hugely expensive -- or nothing at all. For those who need long-term care, the costs are taking up an increasing amount of their medical spending. According to the latest study from the National Health Policy Forum (NHPF) at George Washington University, Americans spent $207.9 billion on long-term services and supports for the elderly and disabled in 2010 -- that's nearly 8% of all health-care spending. The NHPF found that 12% of all Americans turning 65 in 2005 will personally end up incurring long-term care expenses between $25,000 and $100,000. But there will be people who resist, for good reasons or bad, and those people still need some form of self-insurance. The first step is to estimate their ultimate long-term costs.","Nawrocki, Tom", Cover Story,May,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Long term care insurance , Health care expenditures , Polls & surveys , Financial planners , Long term health care , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Reality Versus the Expectations of Reality,"A frequent question the author gets from casual investors is why the stock market rose (fell) when the economic news of the day is bad (good). They often assume that bad economic news should result in an immediate negative movement in stock prices, and vice versa. There are a lot of reasons this relationship isn't nearly as tight as investors suppose. His impression is that the financial media do a good job of positioning new economic news relative to what numbers were expected, but the mainstream media, which devote a few minutes in a given broadcast to financial markets, rarely go to this trouble. The lesson for your clients: stock market reactions to the daily flow of news are not so much about the news itself -- good or bad. They are about whether that news was expected, leading to a reaffirmation of existing market valuations, or a surprise, leading to a reassessment of current valuations.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA", Feature,May,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Valuation , Securities markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Financial Planning magazine named her a ""Mover and Shaker"" in 2009 for her work on proactive insurance planning, and in 2010 Medical Economics magazine included her firm in ""Best Financial Advisers for Doctors."" Doctors are more circumspect about the end of life, and that makes them approach planning differently. It makes some a little more cavalier.

"Withdrawal Rates, Savings Rates, and Valuation-Based Asset Allocation","Although most everyone would agree that stock valuations matter, the question remains whether clients with a long-term outlook (such as those planning for retirement) can hope to act successfully on information about valuations. This article provides favorable evidence based on the historical record for long-term investors to obtain improved retirement planning outcomes (lower savings rates, higher withdrawal rates) using valuation-based asset allocation strategies. But even if clients or advisers decide against adopting valuation-based asset allocation, advisers may at least be able to use the research findings to help persuade clients to stay the course and not give in to the temptation to change their asset allocation in the wrong direction, such as increasing stock holdings after valuations rise or panicking and selling stocks after a plummet in valuations.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Apr,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Long term , Investment advisors , Asset allocation , Valuation , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Housing: A Potentially Active Player in Client Wealth Strategies,"It's easy to overlook the role of housing in clients' finances. Even though home equity can account for a large percentage of personal net worth, advisers and clients often view it as a use-asset, not an investment. There are a few rays of hope that the US housing market is near a bottom. The National Association of Realtors reported that existing-home sales in December 2011 rose 5% versus November's figures and were 3.6% higher than December 2010's results. Mortgages matter. They're a major expense for borrowers, and refinancing at a lower rate is an effective method to free up cash flow. Even with prices depressed nationwide, homes in some markets have held up well and remain expensive. Most of the advisers interviewed for this article view the home as a use-asset, not an investment. Consequently, they believe that short- and medium-term changes in home values don't matter much to the clients' financial health.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP", Cover Story,Apr,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Home ownership , Investment advisors , Client relationships , Personal finance , Housing prices , Housing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

How the Social Security Claiming Decision Affects Portfolio Longevity,"This study illustrates how the Social Security claiming decision can affect the longevity of retirees' financial portfolios. The claiming decision or claiming strategy refers to the month in which the single retiree begins Social Security benefits. For a couple, claiming strategy refers to the months in which each partner begins his or her own benefits and, when applicable, spousal benefits. Reichenstein and Meyer (2011) illustrate that different claiming strategies can produce significant differences in real cumulative lifetime benefits. As a result, it is common sense that if you select a claiming strategy that garners more real lifetime benefits it will extend the longevity of the retiree's financial portfolio. This is the first study to provide estimates of how much longer the financial portfolio will last if a retiree delays the beginning of Social Security benefits.","Meyer, William;Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA", Feature,Apr,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Decision making , Social security , Retirees , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Tax-Efficient Retirement Withdrawal Planning Using a Comprehensive Tax Model,"A highly precise comprehensive tax model that calculates state and federal income taxes (including the AMT, the impending 3.8% Medicare tax, and Medicare premiums) is used to evaluate 15 withdrawal strategies (including variations) and several tax strategies for tax efficiency (the strategy that maximizes the final total account balance over a planning horizon). Base model results show that the tax-efficient strategy is achieved by long-term income stability and characterized by low withdrawal rates early in retirement, sequenced as follows: tax-deferred assets up to tax deductions, the rapid depletion of taxable assets, tax-free assets, and tax-deferred assets, preserved throughout the planning horizon. Strategies that produce the highest final total account balance rarely produce the lowest total taxes. Several common tax minimization and estate planning strategies do not produce optimal results.","Sumutka, Alan R, CPA;Sumutka, Andrew M, PhD;Coopersmith, Lewis W, PhD", Feature,Apr,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Models , Withdrawals , Tax deductions , Income taxes , Retirement planning , Medicare , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Life Transitions and the Brain,"Assisting clients experiencing the stress of major life transitions requires an understanding of the basic structure of the brain. Financial advice is directed at the left hemisphere: it is linear, approaching the problem in logical, sequential order. When your client is facing a life transition, logical advice by itself may not be enough. In such a situation, the adviser must first connect with the client's right brain before directing information to the left brain. By having clients relate their thoughts and feelings, you are helping them connect their right and left hemispheres, which can then process logical, linear advice.","Gallo, Eileen, PhD", Feature,Apr,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment advisors , Client relationships , Life transitions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

How Much Do We Really Know?,"There are many things on which advisors offer counsel that they obviously don't know -- future rates of return, inflation, life expectancies or health issues, families staying together, length of the client relationship. All of these variables play into how they do their planning and how they render advice. The only things that they know observable facts. More important than the analytics are the connections with the clients. Flexibility and adaptability can be created in a number of ways. When clients retire, advisors try to drive down their fixed costs as much as possible so they can adapt much of their spending for when they feel richer or poorer.

Michael Kitces on Tax Planning's 180 and Investing in the Extreme,"In an interview, Michael E. Kitches, director of research at Pinnacle Advisory Group, talked about investment. He thinks that the key to evaluating properly is to understand that having investments and a debt still represents leverage, whether the collateral is stocks-buying ""on margin' -- or a piece of real estate -- buying ""on mortgage."" In either scenario, the clients are using debt to leverage the total assets on their balance sheet in order to achieve a higher return on equity, albeit with the risk that leverage entails. The looming tax-rate environment presents a total upheaval to traditional tax planning. In the traditional world, the standard framework is to accelerate deductions and defer income as long as possible.

Spending Flexibility and Safe Withdrawal Rates,"Shortfall risk retirement income analyses offer little insight into how much risk is optimal, and how risk tolerance affects retirement income decisions. This study models retirement income risk in a manner consistent with risk tolerance in portfolio selection in order to estimate optimal asset allocations and withdrawal rates for retirees with different risk attitudes. The study finds that the 4% retirement withdrawal rate strategy may only be appropriate for risk-averse clients with moderate guaranteed income sources. The ability to accept greater shortfall probabilities means that risk-tolerant investors will prefer a higher withdrawal rate and a riskier retirement portfolio. A risk-tolerant client may prefer a withdrawal rate of between 5% and 7% with a guaranteed income of $20,000. The optimal retirement portfolio allocation to stock increases by between 10 and 30 percentage points and the optimal withdrawal rate increases by between 1 and 2 percentage points for clients with a guaranteed income of $60,000 instead of $20,000.","Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP®;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA;Williams, Duncan, CFP®", Feature,Mar,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Optimization , Studies , Withdrawals , Asset allocation , Personal income , Risk retention , Retirement planning , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Be Careful with Correlation!,"At the heart of portfolio diversification is the assumption that at least some assets have low correlations with each other. Having a better understanding of how assets relate to each other dynamically across different environments can help the adviser build a truly diversified portfolio and help identify the times when the portfolio may be most vulnerable. One reason for a dynamic approach to correlation is that correlations can change as fundamental market forces change. A useful way to capture these changes is to calculate rolling correlations over a certain period. There are more troubling problems with traditional measures of correlation. A particularly grievous one is that, in addition to being time-dependent, correlations are dependent on how well the assets themselves are behaving. One way to view this phenomenon is via a scatter plot in which the returns of one asset are graphed along the x-axis and the returns of the other asset are graphed along the y-axis.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFA, CFP®, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP®", Commentary,Mar,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Graphs , Investment advisors , Portfolio diversification , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Advisers who report higher levels of software integration are more likely to report they are on track to achieve their business and career goals. Advisers who report that their use of technology has increased their efficiency are more likely to say they are on track for achieving their financial goals.

But a lot of it is from unintentional bias. In an original study Cain did with George Loewenstein and Don Moore called ""The Dirt on Coming Clean"", they showed that disclosure can morally license advisers to give worse advice because in some sense audiences have been warned -- caveat emptor.

"An Age-Based, Three-Dimensional Distribution Model Incorporating Sequence and Longevity Risks","The authors develop an age-based, three-dimensional distribution model that illustrates a retirees yearly transition through retirement, including superannuated years (very old age), to demonstrate the impact of longevity risk. The model developed in this paper demonstrates how longevity probability can be developed into dynamic, yearly adjustable distribution periods and these dynamic distribution periods can then be combined with stochastic (Monte Carlo) real returns. The distribution period (DP) can be dynamically managed, as the retiree ages, by varying the percentiles of longevity. The withdrawal rate is very sensitive to DP, and the DP is very sensitive to life expectancy; thus more attention should be paid to longevity risk than has been in past research. The probability of failure (POF) remains a useful metric to evaluate exposure of a retiree's portfolio to market sequence risk, and a POF-based decision rule applies to both the asset allocation effect and the age effect on withdrawal rates.","Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP®;Mitchell, John B, DBA;Blanchett, David M, CFP®, QPA, CFA", Feature,Mar,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Models , Life expectancy , Probability , Studies , Retirement planning , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Convoluted Valuing of Life Insurance Policies,"The valuation of life insurance policies is primarily associated with gifting or selling policies to irrevocable life insurance trusts and measuring the income tax amount when they are distributed from qualified pension plans and welfare benefit trusts. Aside from permanent life insurance being inherently complex, its valuation is more challenging because it can encourage battle between purveyors of qualified and nonqualified plans and the IRS, each side having partisan arguments that interfere with what otherwise could be a more logical approach. The bottom line for asset valuation is to ascertain its fair market value. In the case of Schwab v. Commissioner (136 T.C. No. 6, 2/7111), the court did correctly observe that ""fair market value of insurance contracts can be a slippery concept."" Because life insurance is so complex, it has been used for various tax schemes that have made setting logical valuation methods by the IRS like a game of whack-a-mole.","Katt, Peter C, CFP®, LIC", Commentary,Mar,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Qualified pension plans , Life insurance trusts , Tax court decisions , Insurance policies , Valuation , Life insurance , Fair market value , Valuation methods , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Is Your Email Secure?,"In the past few years, there has been great focus in regulation around securing client data -- specifically, making vendors more responsible for security and for providing more information to clients (advisers). But in light of the recent hacking incident at Stratfor Global intelligence advisers might be thinking how to combat this. If the adviser's email is going to a business, then most likely the mail is secure. If it is a personal account, he should ask his mail provider the question. Whatever the answer, he should add it to his compliance manual. Compliance regulations require the monitoring of employee email communication.

The best practices are: 1. Have expertise on staff. 2. Focus on the content. 3. Think beyond reporting efficiencies. 4. Introduce Web portals slowly. 5. Be prepared to help with passwords. 6. Stick to reports. 7. Be flexible.","Schulaka, Carly", Feature,Mar,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Web portals , Technology adoption , Guidelines , Best practice , Service introduction , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Downright Revolutionary: But Is Today's Technology Enhancing Client Interactions?,"Today, 7% of World Wide Web traffic comes from mobile devices -- smartphones and tablets -- but it's projected that by 2014 the majority of Web traffic will be coming from mobile devices, not from PCs. Twenty-four percent of the 407 financial planners who took FPA's Adviser Technology Use &amp; Benefits survey are using a tablet professionally, and 71% are using a smartphone. When asked to describe the impact of technology on their client interactions, almost three-quarters of planners in the FPA survey report that client satisfaction has increased. Advisers like email and texting for obvious reasons -- they're fast, efficient, and immediate. It's one thing to buy a tablet and justify its use for late-night online reading or to appeal to that very special but tiny group of clients an adviser just knows will be seduced by the latest and greatest, and another thing entirely to adopt a radically different business model that relies only on mobile devices.","Lee, Shelley A", Cover Story,Mar,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Technology adoption , Portable computers , Information technology , Smartphones , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

A Utility-Based Approach to Evaluating Investment Strategies,"Previous studies on asset allocation for retirement have typically focused on the probability of running out of money as the key evaluation measure. In this article the author develops an approach that broadens the measures to also include the magnitude of plan failure and expected bequest amounts. He combines these three financial measures into a proposed single utility measure. To provide a utility measure for plan failures, he uses the behavioral concept of loss aversion. Results of an informal survey are used to gauge loss aversion. The analysis uses a specific retirement example to demonstrate how the utility concepts are developed and applied. The available asset classes are stocks, bonds, and an inflation-adjusted immediate annuity. The results demonstrate the importance of individual loss aversion characteristics in setting an asset allocation strategy. Also, the assumption about future stock returns is critical. Optimal allocations tend toward 100% stocks or 100% annuities depending on loss aversion and the stock return assumption.","Tomlinson, Joseph A, FSA, CFP", Feature,Feb,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Failure , Asset allocation , Utility functions , Investment policy , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Dynamic Asset Allocation: Using Momentum to Enhance Portfolio Risk Management,"The best-designed asset allocation and rebalancing systems are not infallible -- they were not designed to meet every market circumstance. Something else is needed when the core assumptions of modern portfolio theory (MPT) are violated. Dynamic asset allocation (DAA) is a response to those times when MPTs key assumptions need to change. Rebalancing, which is designed to exploit mean reversion among asset-class returns, needs to be taken to the next level. A particular example of DAA, momentum-based moving average (MA) strategies, represents a more proactive means of achieving the goals of rebalancing. A specific application of an MA strategy is illustrated. DAA, in combination with modernized' MPT and tail-risk hedging (when all else fails), collectively form the vanguard of the next generation of investment risk management.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFA, CFP, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP", Feature,Feb,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Asset allocation , Risk management , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Reversing the Conventional Wisdom: Using Home Equity to Supplement Retirement Income,"This paper examines three strategies for using home equity, in the form of a reverse mortgage credit line, to increase the safe maximum initial rate of retirement income withdrawals. These strategies are: 1. the conventional, passive strategy of using the reverse mortgage as a fast resort after exhausting the securities portfolio; and two active strategies, 2. a coordinated strategy under which the credit line is drawn upon according to an algorithm designed to maximize portfolio recovery after negative investment returns, and 3. drawing upon the reverse mortgage credit line first, until exhausted. A three-spreadsheet stochastic model is described, with one spreadsheet incorporating each strategy. The authors find substantial increases in the cash flow survival probability when the active strategies are used as compared with the results when the conventional strategy is used. The model also shows that the retiree's residual net worth after 30 years is about twice as likely to be greater when an active strategy is used than when the conventional strategy is used.","Sacks, Barry H, JD, PhD;Sacks, Stephen R, PhD", Feature,Feb,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Home equity loans , Studies , Stochastic models , Reverse mortgages , Investment policy , Lines of credit , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Life Planning ... Extending the Conversation,"In 1995, Dick Wagner and George Kinder, founders of the Nazrudin Project, affirmed that money is more than numbers. The word holistic crept into the planning lexicon as they recognized that issues of money and finance should be related to the whole person, to issues surrounding life -- now and going forward. Life planning, financial life planning, and life transitions planning are all terms frequently used. Money conversations should be replaced with life transitions conversations. A business must orchestrate memorable events for its customers, and that memory itself becomes the product. The overall goal in mastering holistic conversations and the precepts of life transitions is to further develop a well-defined, interdependent, and sequential framework, and apply it to a series of client challenges that include, but transcend, traditional approaches to money, retirement, estate planning, and business planning issues. Additional education, and potentially coaching, is central to your growth and development as a fiduciary and as a valued adviser, set apart from the ordinary and product-centric approaches.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CRC", Commentary,Feb,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Clients , Financial planners , Retirement planning , Life transitions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Selecting and Maintaining Appropriate Fiduciaries in an Estate Plan,"Probate courts are rife with litigation involving fiduciaries. Fiduciaries are individuals or institutions designated to handle financial and health-care matters during client incapacity and to distribute assets to beneficiaries upon death. They are successor trustees of the living trust, executors of the will, and agents under the financial and health-care powers of attorney. However, in conflicted families or in complex estates, these individuals may not be the best choice. Other choices include professional advisers, corporate trustees, or private professional fiduciaries. If a client is incapacitated or deceased, and his or her documents do not specify a manner in which to remove and replace fiduciaries, a court will need to make the determination. Although there are times when clients may want to make it difficult to remove and replace a fiduciary, often they will want to preserve family harmony, avoid litigation, and ensure their affairs are handled as planned by building in other safeguards.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP", Commentary,Feb,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Selection , Fiduciaries , Estate planning , Powers of attorney , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Estate Planning for Unmarried Couples: What Financial Planners Need to Know,"In their 2005 book, Money Without Matrimony: The Unmarried Couple's Guide to Financial Security, co-authors Sheryl Garrett, CFP, and Debra A. Neiman, CFP, painted a grim picture of what the surviving member of an unmarried couple might face after the death of a partner. They can become mired in a financial and emotional mess -- destitute and homeless -- all while trying to cope with the loss of a partner. Given today's demographic trends, it would hardly be unusual for a planner to be sitting across the desk from an unmarried couple. For financial planners, the challenge is to know enough to provide accurate and helpful general guidance on estate planning (and related) topics to such couples, but avoid straying beyond their level of expertise -- just as they would with married heterosexual couples. But some planners may wish to take on an additional challenge: boning up on the estate planning issues specific to unmarried couples in order to broaden their client base.","Stolz, Richard F", Cover Story,Feb,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Couples , Financial planners , Estate planning , Cohabitation , Domestic partners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
'How Do I Know You Won't Steal My Money?',"How do I know you won't steal my money? If a prospective client asked you that question, how would you answer? At first the question stunned the author when he was asked it about nine years ago. His mind had gone suddenly rigid and he thought to himself, how do he answer that question. He quickly realized there was only one obvious answer: You don't. Then he discussed with him what questions he should ask and what legal safeguards he should look for. He became an excellent client. These and many others are from what he calls the mud of the marketplace. It isn't a position, a law, a standard, or a designation that determines a person's honesty. It is good character. It maybe true that it is possible to move from a suitability standard to a fiduciary standard and create a greater degree of sensitivity for what is right for a client. Certainly there is more accountability.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP", Commentary,Feb,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Attorneys , Clients , Fiduciary responsibility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Analytical Disconnect,"Earlier this fall, the Journal of Financial Planning's editorial staff asked the author to offer his take on the results of their annual retirement income planning study. Not surprisingly, several results caught his eye as comment-worthy. However, nothing grabbed his attention more than this: responding planners reported that, on average, 24% of their retired clients had experienced a significant change in their lifestyle from last year to this. In his experience working with their clients and in talking with colleagues around the US, he has come to believe that when clients trust their adviser they place a very high value on the adviser's interpretation of how economic and market conditions relate to their personal financial well-being. However, the analytical tools and resources that inform their advice on this matter are what he wants to explore. In short he suggests that at present, many tools are much less helpful than either they or their clients need them to be.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP", Commentary,Feb,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Lifestyles , Changes , Financial planners , Trust , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

According to Davey, financial planning is invariably about having to make one or more trade-off decisions. One of the classic trade-off decisions around an investment strategy has to do with three aspects of risk -- risk required, risk capacity, and risk tolerance. Educating clients about risk, particularly portfolio risk, strikes him as being a really critical step. They are actually working on trying to get a set of standards together. They are working with the behavioral finance people at Barclays Wealth and Oxford Risk. The other thing he thinks that's really important to do, although he thinks it's tricky, is to talk in terms of today's dollars.","Schulaka, Carly", Interview,Feb,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Standardization , Directors , Risk management , United States--US , Davey, Geoff",ProQuest One Academic

"Capital Market Expectations, Asset Allocation, and Safe Withdrawal Rates","Most retirement withdrawal rate studies are based either on historical data or use a particular assumption about portfolio returns unique to the study in question. But planners may have their own capital market expectations for future returns from stocks, bonds, and other assets they deem suitable for their clients' portfolios. The objective of this study is to provide a general framework for thinking about how to estimate sustainable withdrawal rates and appropriate asset allocations for clients, based on ones capital market expectations, as well as other inputs about the client including the planning horizon, tolerance for exhausting wealth, and personal concerns. The study also tests the sensitivity of various assumptions for the recommended withdrawal rates and asset allocations, and finds that these assumptions are very important. This study shows that usually there is a wide range of asset allocations that can be expected to perform nearly as well as the optimal allocation, and that lower stock allocations are justifiable in many cases.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA", Feature,Jan,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Withdrawals , Asset allocation , Capital markets , Rates of return",ProQuest One Academic

Asking the Wrong Questions of FINRA,"Congressional hearings are often criticized for having more show than substance. This past fall's hearing about a draft bill creating an SRO for investment advisers had some of these qualities, in a guest post on the blog Nerd's Eye View at Kitces.com Duane Thompson, president of Potomac Strategies and former chief of government relations for FPA, described the surreal sight of a portrait of Michael Oxley hanging behind the House Financial Services subcommittee during the proceedings. Today, Oxley is the chief lobbyist for FINRA. Congress is asking the wrong questions of FINRA. What Congress should be investigating is whether FINRA should be shut down entirely. Shutting down FINRA may sound impossible, but the UK has put an end to the charade and shut down its SRO in regulatory reform. Congress would be wise to insist on a new SRO entirety independent of FINRA that does have transparency, accountability, sensible exam processes, and dispute resolution that seeks justice, not settlement.","Moisand, Dan, CFP", Feature,Jan,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Regulatory agencies , Reforms , Investment advisors , Regulatory reform , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Marketing Coaches: In Search of the Right Fit,"Marketing financial services dependent on asset class correlation, actuarial risk, and the time value of money can be as tough as selling sabermetrics. Although financial advisers require little adaptation to statistics (they love them), when it comes to selling those stats, survey after survey shows advisers rate their marketing effectiveness as low. Sales coaches assist advisers in closing a sale; these coaches were more popular when financial planning was a more transaction-oriented business. Marketing is merely the right skills set made visible. For Million Dollar Producer Inc president Kenneth Unger, the key to successful marketing lies in proactive, regular communication -- mailings, meetings, and seminars. He recommends a minimum of monthly mailings to clients, with the subject matter determined by the current economic climate and the media's reaction to that climate. Whatever the approach to generating referrals, the importance of frequent communication between planner and client cannot be overemphasized.","Grote, Jim, CFP", Cover Story,Jan,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Communication , Marketing , Client relationships , Financial services , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

When to Start Collecting Social Security Benefits: A Break-Even Analysis,"Many factors affect the decision of when to file for Social Security benefits, including health, personal financial considerations, and employment status. If clients can be flexible in their decision, planners should help them assess the financial advantage of the options available. One method of assessing the financial advantage is to calculate the break-even age. Break-even is the age when total Social Security income from two retirement options is the same. Using break-even calculations, the authors compare three basic options for when to start collecting Social Security benefits: 1. age 62, 2. full retirement age, and 3. age 70. The rate of return needs to exceed the rate of inflation by a lesser amount to justify taking benefits at full retirement age rather than waiting until age 70. It may make sense for a man to start collecting benefits at full retirement age rather than waiting until age 70 if the rate of return exceeds the inflation rate by as little as 3%.","Lemons, Doug", Feature,Jan,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Decision making , Financial planning , Age , Social security , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Next Generation Investment Risk Management: Putting the 'Modern' Back in Modern Portfolio Theory,"The market crash in the fall of 2008 exposed many problems with the oversimplifying assumptions often used in implementing the modern portfolio theory (MPT) framework. The author describe more sophisticated methods of estimating the three principal assumptions used in MPT -- returns, risk, and relationships. The authors also discuss ways of improving the optimization process itself. Optimization process allows for non-normal distributions of returns, and recognize that an investment horizon is not a single uninterrupted period. This allows the optimizer to reflect how volatility erodes returns and show the beneficial effects of rebalancing. This is all just one step toward the goal of bringing investment risk management into the next generation for financial planners.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFA, CFP, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP", Feature,Jan,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment advisors , Risk management , Volatility , Rates of return , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Maximize Your Technology Spending in 2012,"The new year typically marks a brand new budget cycle for your firm's operating expenses. No doubt an increasing portion of your budget is allocated for your existing technology infrastructure and to fund new purchases for the year. Although most planners have a good handle on estimating annual technology expenses needed to keep the current tools and systems in place, many don't know how much money should be allocated for purchases of new products and technology in the year ahead. You do not need to spend thousands of dollars to discover ways to grow your business and get more accomplished each day. With a budget of $5,000, you have the potential to gain a significant return on investment with the purchase of the right technology.

Cash Value Life Insurance for the Bad Times,"All financial planners know that life insurance serves as a cornerstone of a client's risk management plan by preserving the insured's human capital for named beneficiaries in the event of an early death. The economic uncertainty that has plagued people people since 2008 has been well documented. High unemployment, low levels of job creation, declining incomes, and reduced access to credit have presented challenges for many. Recently published studies on participant use of 401(k) plans raise concerns that the economic challenges individuals face and the choices they make in light of those challenges may have long-term effects on their financial security beyond the Great Recession. Although cash value life insurance is not appropriate for all clients, planners recognize the tax advantages and typically view the cash values as part of the low-risk portion of the client's portfolio. Still, planners often dismiss the use of permanent life insurance policies during good economic cycles when investment returns exceed returns on life insurance policy cash values.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA, CFP", Feature,Jan,2012,Journal of Financial Planning," Insurance policies , Risk management , Life insurance , Beneficiaries , Recessions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Tyranny of Compounding Fees: Are Mutual Funds Bleeding Retirement Accounts Dry?,"Investments in retirement accounts are plagued by poor returns. An important factor is that, in aggregate, returns of actively managed equity mutual funds trail those of broad market indices. This paper partitions the real total return of the S&amp;P 500 into: return to mutual fund investors and return to the financial services industry. The financial services industry share of market returns increases with the length of investment period. For annual performance lags of 250 basis points, the industry share over 10 years is about 46% on average: over 50 years it increases to 74%. The shares of market returns to investors and the financial services industry are highly variable for shorter investment periods, but this variability declines as the investment period increases. The author recommends that pension plan fiduciaries be required to select default investments with a management expense ratio as low as possible, ideally no greater than 10 bps.","Neufeld, Stewart, PhD", Feature,Dec,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Mutual funds , Financial services , Retirement planning , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

If you can help them identify earlier what their values are, and then look at their spending, they'll realize their spending isn't in line with their values.

Improving Risk-Adjusted Returns Using Market-Valuation-Based Tactical Asset Allocation Strategies,"Studies examining the value of active management strategies tend to analyze performance within asset classes against narrowly defined benchmarks; there is little research analyzing tactical asset allocation strategies that change allocations among asset classes, rather than within them. The distribution of expected returns and volatility are statistically significantly different at valuation extremes than they are from the general distribution of returns. As a result, the efficient frontier itself can shift because of varying capital market assumptions across different valuation environments, which in turn implies that asset allocations should change as market valuations change. A basic market-valuation-based tactical asset allocation strategy that underweights equities (relative to bonds) in overvalued environments, and overweights equities in favorably valued environments, can lead to higher returns and improved risk-adjusted returns. The results for improvements in return and risk-adjusted returns hold up on an ex ante analysis and a historical analysis.","Solow, Kenneth R, CFP, CLU, ChFC;Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC;Locatelli, Sauro", Feature,Dec,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Asset allocation , Valuation , Investment policy , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

In order to avoid inclusion of the assets of the SLAT in the gross estate of the spouse/beneficiary under IRC Section 2036, only separate property of the grantor may be used to fund the SLAT. In a community property state, the community should be bifurcated into equal shares of separate property, and the grantor should transfer his or her share of the separate property to the SLAT. Also, to avoid inclusion of the assets of the SLAT in the gross estate of the grantor under IRC Section 2036, the grantor should not serve as trustee.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Feature,Dec,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Couples , Irrevocable trusts , Gift taxes , Tax exemptions , Community property , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

3 Ideas for Preserving the Financial Security of New Retirees,"There can be no doubt that the huge generation starting to enter retirement faces unprecedented financial challenges. A confluence of factors will make it hard for many to maintain their desired lifestyles, or even lifestyles they consider acceptable, throughout their retirements. Chronic under-saving for retirement by members of this generation and their higher life expectancy at age 65 are not the only factors. Under current circumstances, financial advisers will have to adapt new strategies to help preserve the financial security of retirees. The key question is whether something more is required, and what exactly it is. After World War II, the basic idea for financial security in retirement had been the ""three-legged stool"" of basically one-third of income from the government in the form of Social Security, one-third from employers in the form of traditional pensions, and one-third from personal savings.","Greenwald, Mathew, PhD", Feature,Dec,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Life expectancy , Lifestyles , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Mortality Assumptions: Are Planners Getting It Right?,"In its annual retirement income planning study, FPA asked financial planners what age they typically plan to for their male and female clients. The average ages weren't too surprising: 91.7 for male clients and 94.0 for female clients. It's important for financial planners to know where their mortality assumption comes from, whether it is appropriate for each client, and what the risks are for getting the planning age incorrect. This article provides background for planners who assume that planning to life expectancy is sufficient for retirement planning purposes. Life expectancy is simply a point estimate based on probabilities; people actually die at lower and higher ages. Evaluating planners' assumptions begins with discussing the ""right"" mortality table to use to determine planning ages. There are many mortality tables with many different uses. The best known are the US general population mortality tables published by the Social Security Administration.","Krueger, Cheryl, CFP, FSA", Feature,Dec,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Life expectancy , Mortality , Retirement planning , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Digging deeper though, a fascinating set of divergent patterns, depicting both healthy connections and troubling dysfunctions, also come to light and point out directions for future exploration. Planners utilizing the systematic withdrawal methodology (either ""always"" or frequently"") to generate retirement income now outnumber all other approaches by 2 to 1 or more -- at 74.8%.

Scenario Planning for a Complex Retirement Outlook,"On Mar 9, 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank to levels it hadn't seen since 1997 -- the banking sector was in collapse, and the entire economy was in disarray. It's safe to say that every retirement scenario in America changed on that day, and not in a good way. According to FPA's Financial Adviser Retirement Income Planning Experiences, Strategies, and Recommendations study, based on an August 2011 survey of almost 600 planners, over the past year alone 15% of advisory clients nearing retirement have had to delay their retirement date. Ten percent needed to significantly adjust their lifestyle because of economic conditions. For those advisers who had already talked to their clients about the possibility that market unrest could play havoc with their retirement plans -- and had sown the seeds to protect against such an event -- the process was much easier.","Nawrocki, Tom", Cover Story,Dec,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Dow Jones averages , Financial planning , Investment advisors , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Success with Room to Grow,"The success or failure of retirement income planning can be judged on some level by whether clients outlive their money or need to make significant changes to their lifestyle to accommodate retirement. Since 2008, FPA has annually surveyed financial planners in an effort to gauge the relative success of retirement income planning strategies. The 2011 study, fielded in August among 595 experienced planners, reveals a general level of success, but also room for improvement. Although survey respondents are overwhelmingly process-based (78% typically select a retirement income strategy and use products to implement that strategy), some planners seek a single processor product to accomplish successful retirement income planning.","Schulaka, Carly", News,Dec,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Polls & surveys , Financial planners , Success , Retirement planning , Retirement income , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"William Bengen on Risk, Volatility, and Safe Withdrawal Rates in Today's Markets","In an interview, William Bengen, CFP, financial planner, researcher and developer of the ""4% rule"", talked about how his safe withdrawal rates have stood up in today's volatile markets. Bengen said the critical thing to permit higher withdrawal rates is the depression in stock prices that occurs at the end of a bear market. He hasn't seen anything in the past 20 years that would permit you to withdraw at a higher rate than the 4.5% that he recommends. They'd have to go much, much lower than they are now, or they did in 2009 even, to consider a higher withdrawal rate. That's how ridiculously overvalued the stock market has been for 20 years. He thinks he learned a lot about investing also. That's where he really started his investing career.

The scientific method provides a framework for validating the professions best practices, so that practitioners can have confidence that their ""best"" practices are based on the ""best"" evidence. If financial planning is to leave its adolescent stage of development and achieve its full potential as a learned profession, three requirements must be met: 1. It will require a commitment by all practitioners to stay abreast of new research. 2. It will require practitioners to possess or acquire the ability to read and critically evaluate that research and a commitment by financial planning educational programs to impart those skills to students. 3. It will require a commitment on the part of practitioners to partner with academics in identifying the professions most important questions and designing research initiatives to answer them.","Buie, Elissa, CFP;Yeske, Dave, DBA, CFP", Feature,Nov,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Research , Financial planning , Best practice , Professions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Analyzing Separately Managed Accounts,"Majority of serious studies on investment managers have focused on mutual funds. This focus on mutual funds is at odds with how investors choose to use the various forms of delegated money management. For example, the aggregate amount of dollars invested in mutual funds is similar to that invested in separately managed accounts (SMA). With the advent of high-quality data sets that document the returns and characteristics of separately managed accounts, the disparity between mutual fund studies and SMAs is being addressed. The author's colleagues Jim Peterson, Michael Iachini, and Wynce Lam (hereafter referred to as ""PIL"") provide an excellent example of the new work in this area. PIL studied 3,081 domestic equity strategies from 1991-2009. PIL concluded that when evaluating SMAs, past performance does matter assuming the performance is properly adjusted for various sources of risk. However, there is more to the story. Those managers willing to be more active had better returns, as did managers who didn't get too large in terms of assets invested in their strategy.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA", Feature,Nov,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Investment advisors , Investment policy , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Probability-of-Failure-Based Decision Rules to Manage Sequence Risk in Retirement,"This paper demonstrates how practitioners can better use the often-overlooked probability of failure as a decision tool. Withdrawal rates depend on the retirees age, and therefore withdrawal rates alone do not tell a complete sustainable distribution story. Probability of failure does not depend on the retiree's age and is therefore useful for comparison of withdrawal rates over any time period or asset allocation. Comparison of probability-of-failure curves, and their shift between strategies, illustrates how effective one strategy is compared with another. The methodology presented provides an ability to evaluate the withdrawal rate and exposure to sequence risk together. The paper concludes with practical applications for practitioners from two key insights: results from a prior simulation would be different for a current simulation (different transient states as defined in the paper) and a range or probability of failure is desired over trying to maintain a steady probability of failure.","Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP;Mitchell, John B, DBA;Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,Nov,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Probability distribution , Simulation , Asset allocation , Retirement planning , Risk exposure , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"With Higher Taxes Looming, Are Your Clients Ready?","The current federal estate- and gift-tax exemptions and rates expire at the end of 2012, and the current law calls for higher taxes in 2013. Given the spiraling US federal deficit and popular support for taxing the wealthy, it's easier to imagine both income- and estate-tax rates for wealthy taxpayers going higher rather than lower. Some tax increases are already scheduled for 2013 unless Congress acts in the interim to change them. These include: 1. ordinary income, 2. qualified dividends, 3. itemized medical deductions, and 4. federal estate taxes. An ideal tax-planning strategy provides sound economic benefits that help clients achieve their financial goals in addition to potential tax savings. These are: 1. Take advantage of timing opportunities. 2. Combine depressed asset prices and valuation discounts. 3. Consider dynasty trusts for asset protection and multigenerational benefits. 4.

He actually doesn't think there will be too many long-term repercussions of this downgrade. The long-term average ratio of home price to income is around 260%, which strikes him as reasonable. He's not sure there's an optimal level. He thinks they are still a long way from inflation being a problem. Inflation is almost never a problem until the economy comes back near full employment.

Marty recommended they buy no-lapse UL policies with premiums guaranteed to Helen's age 100, when they will terminate. He recommended two companies for the purchases. One of the company's premiums were 20% higher than the other. In 2007, the amounts of premiums were at the outer limits of Doug and Helen's comfort zone.

Communicating to Overcome Client Market Fears,"The recession may be technically over, but investor wariness isn't. Clients showing up for their annual meetings with advisers are expressing fear about where -- or whether -- to invest their money. Many are taking larger cash positions than anyone would recommend under any circumstances. To get clients to move put their emotions, many planners try to get them talking. Expressing the emotion helps reduce its intensity, which helps investors engage in more rational conversations with their planners. And planners who communicate more frequently with their clients -- especially during periods of economic turbulence -- have higher levels of client satisfaction, trust, and retention, and higher gross revenue, according to numerous studies. It's also helpful to create contingency plans. Before the market drops 20%, and while your clients are still unemotional about it, discuss what they'd like to do under that and other scenarios -- and put it in writing.","Budgar, Laurie", Cover Story,Oct,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Communication , Financial planners , Emotions , Client relationships , Contingency planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Earnings Stability as a Source of Alpha,"Traditional valuation measures such as P/E ratios have long been recognized as a reliable source of outperformance in stock selection processes. Greenblatt (2006) and Montier (2007) show that stock selection processes can be improved by combining valuation measures with profitability measures such as return on assets. In this paper, the author argues that earnings stability, defined as the historic standard deviation of corporate earnings, is another criterion that can enhance stock selection processes. The author tests earnings stability as a source of alpha for five country-based stock market indices -- as a single source of alpha as well as in combination with other indicators. The paper finds that although earnings stability as a sole indicator has limited use, it can enhance stock selection processes based on traditional valuation and profitability ratios. It does so by eliminating stocks of companies with highly volatile, unpredictable earnings that may suffer from overly optimistic investor expectations, thus reducing portfolio volatility.","Klement, Joachim, CFP, CFA", Feature,Oct,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , International , Return on assets , Valuation , Corporate profits , Securities markets , Profits , Profitability , Volatility",ProQuest One Academic
Getting on Track for a Sustainable Retirement: A Reality Check on Savings and Work,"The aim of traditional retirement planning is to set a wealth accumulation target for one's retirement date so that desired expenditures can be obtained using a safe withdrawal rate. But it is quite difficult to know if one is making progress toward this target. Fortunately, it is not necessary to focus on a wealth accumulation target for the retirement date. The accumulation and retirement phases should not be treated separately in this way. This article outlines a framework for considering whether clients in mid-career are on track for a sustainable retirement. It investigates what combinations of savings rates and years of continued work would have allowed someone to have always accumulated enough by retirement to afford ones desired retirement expenditures in all of the rolling periods from the historical data.

Target-Date Funds: A Temporary Solution to a Permanent Problem,"The widespread acceptance of target-date portfolios has improved participant investing. More participants are deciding to let investment professionals manage their accounts and will likely achieve higher returns and less risk as a result. Unfortunately, target-date portfolios, in particular target-date funds, are widely misused and are not properly understood by 401(k) plan participants. Because of this, target-date funds are likely only a temporary solution to the permanent problem of 401(k) plan participant self-direction. This paper will introduce an automatic managed account solution designed to be a permanent asset allocation solution for 401(k) plan participants. Initial evidence suggests professionally managed portfolios designed in a way to maximize participant use have advice-acceptance rates of more than 80% and dramatically improve the probability of 401(k) plan participants accumulating enough assets to fund retirement income.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,Sep,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Lifecycle funds , Studies , Investment advisors , Asset allocation , Retirement planning , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

PPLI is a custom-designed variable universal life insurance policy tailored to meet the specific needs of the purchaser. The cash value accumulation in a PPLI can be invested in traditional vehicles, such as mutual funds, but these policies are often structured to include hedge funds or private equity investments. In 2010, Congress passed health-care and tax legislation that is likely to make PPLI a more attractive alternative for wealthy individuals. First, the health-care legislation imposed a Medicare sur-tax on investment income beginning in 2013 for individuals with adjusted gross income over $200,000 and married couples filing jointly with adjusted gross income over $250,000.

Can REITs Sustain Double-Digit Returns?,"Much of REITs total returns over the last three decades can be attributable to their relatively high current dividend yields; over the last 10 years, yields have averaged approximately 5.7%, according to NAREIT data. REIT organizations have also been able to make their shares more valuable over time. Many financial advisers measure risk in terms of standard deviations and volatility. One risk, which REIT investors saw up close and personal from 2007 to 2009, is economic recession, particularly if accompanied by credit contractions. Another, although more transitory, risk is REIT shares losing favor with investors at times. One more risk for REIT investors is rising interest rates. Although financial advisers should, of course, understand the risks and cyclicality of commercial real estate and REIT shares, they should not ignore their total return potential, both on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis, and their ability to diversify investment portfolios.","Block, Ralph", Feature,Sep,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment advisors , REITs , Risk assessment , Rates of return , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Considering Commodities: Benefits and Traps,"Commodities investing, once an obscure corner of the markets, has moved into the mainstream thanks to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other vehicles that easily allow investors to partake in a wide spectrum of investing opportunities from oil and gold to wheat and soybeans. For Adrian Cronje, chief investment officer, Balentine, one reason to incorporate commodities into client portfolios is to protect against unanticipated inflation. Another consideration is the low correlation commodities have with other asset classes. However, commodities are more difficult than other investments for financial advisers to evaluate, and also more difficult to value because they have no baked-in risk premium, says Wayne Lin, portfolio manager and investment strategy analyst, Legg Mason Strategic Real Return Fund. As a result, it's important to fine-tune exposure to commodities depending on the market and macroeconomic environment. David Twibell, president, Custom Portfolio Group, adjusts the amount of commodities exposure in client portfolios depending on the age of the client.","Buttell, Amy E", Feature,Sep,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Advantages , Disadvantages , Investment advisors , Commodities trading , Investment policy , Commodities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Advisers Embrace Alternative Investments,"According to findings from FPA's 2011 Alternative Investments study, conducted May 16, 2011-May 31, 2011, with 410 financial advisers who use/recommend investments for at least some of their clients, the majority of advisers surveyed (91%) are using alternative investments. Most advisers (57.2%) use them with more clients than they did 12 months ago, and about one-third (31.8%) plan to increase their use of alternative investments over the next two years. Nearly 68% of advisers surveyed use traded REITs, real estate mutual funds, or real estate ETFs (including global real estate funds) in client portfolios. In contrast, just 32.7% of advisers surveyed use non-traded REITs in client portfolios. It may be no surprise that when asked, ""For what purpose do you use/recommend alternative investments?"" advisers overwhelmingly indicate diversification (95.5%) and inflation protection (67.7%). However, advisers are also using alternative investments for higher return potential, generating income, or for tax benefits.","Schulaka, Carly", Feature,Sep,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Polls & surveys , Alternatives , Statistical data , Investment advisors , REITs , Investment policy , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Who Are We?,"The Financial Planning Association's (FPA) membership roster has dropped over the last couple of years, and there are many theories as to why this is the case. A couple of articles from trade publications listed several factors for this, including fallout from the financial crisis and the weak economy. One implied that since some associations have increased their membership this must be happening at the expense of FPA. One of the limiting factors many commentators miss regarding the number of members in FPA is quite simple: the profession isn't very large. There are a lot more people who say they are financial planners than actually practice financial planning full time in a professional way. Building skills, nurturing relationships, forging new ground, expanding the body of knowledge, advancing professionalism, and advocating for the profession are some of the reasons to join an association.","Moisand, Dan, CFP", Commentary,Sep,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Associations , Memberships , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Tax-Efficient Retirement Withdrawal Planning Using a Linear Programming Model,"A common rule (CR) for withdrawing retirement savings is to withdraw taxable savings before tax-deferred savings, but this strategy can inflate required minimum distributions (RMD) and reduce tax efficiency and wealth. However, tax-efficient (TE) withdrawal schemes can determine withdrawals that maximize the final total account balance over a retirement horizon. This paper considers identical scenarios (for example, initial wealth, living expenses excluding federal taxes, Social Security, tax deductions), but use different withdrawal methods (TE using a linear programming spreadsheet model versus CR) to determine withdrawals and federal taxes while satisfying RMDs over a 25-year planning horizon (to age 90). The paper compares the final total account balances for various combinations of taxable rates of return (ROR), tax-deferred ROR, initial taxable savings, and itemized deductions. Results show that TE models can significantly outperform CR when taxable ROR is greater than tax-deferred ROR, initial taxable wealth is greater than 10% of total retirement wealth and itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction.","Coopersmith, Lewis W, PhD;Sumutka, Alan R, CPA", Feature,Sep,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Linear programming , Studies , Withdrawals , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Taxable income , Savings , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Identify Potential Investment Outcomes with Scenario Analysis,"Financial advisers face a high degree of uncertainty as to how the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial crisis will play out over the next few years, and the range of potential outcomes is particularly wide. Yet against this backdrop, advisers must continue to prudently manage client assets to meet their clients' financial objectives. To assess the absolute and relative return potential of investment asset classes, the author's firm starts by analyzing the broad economic environment and underlying conditions and evaluating the similarities to and differences from prior periods. The goal is to determine the range of macro-economic scenarios the firm thinks have a reasonable likelihood of playing out over the next five years. Meanwhile, it makes sense for the adviser to regularly question his own assumptions and judgments in order to make sure he is peeling back all the layers of the onion to identify and understand all the important variables that could affect any investment being considered.","Lowenstein, Alice, CFP", Commentary,Sep,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment advisors , Investment policy , Economic conditions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
A New Beginning After Divorce,"The author has had what seems like an inordinate number of clients going through big transitions this year. Two of the most challenging include the death of a spouse or divorce. In the death of a spouse, there are special considerations. Only certain decisions must be made immediately, and planners can help clients navigate the ones that must be addressed. It's not always true, but often, time can ease the loss from a spouse's death, whereas in a divorce, the pain can continue for decades. Clients who are divorcing are seeking professional help at a time when they usually feel the lowest in their lives. Planners can improve greatly the chances they'll get to a good outcome sooner rather than later. Good settlements address the primary concerns of both parties while equitably dividing property and income so that one party does not become state-dependent shortly after the divorce while the other party's lifestyle continues uninterrupted.","Sewell, Bonnie A, CFP, AIF", Commentary,Sep,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Divorce , Financial planners , Settlements & damages , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Compliance Update in Plain English,"Staying compliant with ever-evolving regulations in the financial planning field can seem overwhelming. Not only are advisers told to stay vigilant on the bigger issues that could transform their profession, many wonder whether they are even keeping up with compliance changes requiring immediate action on their part. Although the larger issues highlighted in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, such as fiduciary standards and investment adviser oversight, are discussed, this article focuses on the practical aspects of compliance requiring consideration and action today, depending on one's professional circumstances.

How to Improve Retirement Income Planning Software for the Mid-market,"In 2003 the International Foundation for Retirement Education co-sponsored a study with the SOA and LIMRA to evaluate retirement planning software programs. The software included the retirement planning components of popular programs used by financial planners, the proprietary software of several financial services firms, and key consumer programs available via the Internet. The study was repeated in 2009 using 12 programs and more in-depth case studies. Software was categorized as to whether it primarily addressed investments and portfolio management, how much to save for retirement, or how to manage retirement resources and risks. The 2009 study found much progress was made in professional programs, but that there is still room for improvement in key-post retirement risk areas. Once best practices for managing post-retirement risks and income are identified, modeling methods and client reporting will quickly improve.","Meredith, Betty, CFA, CFP, CRC", Feature,Aug,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Software , Research , Best practice , Risk management , Retirement planning , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Off the Rack Versus Savile Row: The Value of Custom Tailoring for Equity Investors,"Separately managed accounts (SMAs) generally carry a higher fee structure than standard mutual funds, but managers tout the ability to customize accounts as being worthy of this higher cost. This customization may increase returns, or it may simply allow for more personalized tax management or control over other unique circumstances. Very little research exists on the relative return benefit of SMAs compared with actively managed mutual funds. The authors fill this gap by examining firms that offer concurrently managed funds -- SMAs as well as matching mutual funds run by the same managers and following the same general strategy. They find that large-cap SMAs provide no significant improvement in performance compared with the mutual funds concurrently offered by these managers. Although customization may be necessary for some, for most investors an ""off the rack"" approach offered by mutual funds may be the simplest tactic.","Dolvin, Steven, PhD, CFA;Gonas, John, PhD", Feature,Aug,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Large cap investments , Mutual funds , Investment advisors , Tax planning , Portfolio management",ProQuest One Academic
Why Portability Isn't a Cure-All,"The 2010 Tax Act has made it possible, under specified circumstances, for the estate of a surviving spouse to make use of the unused estate tax exemption of his or her predeceased spouse, a concept referred to as portability of the applicable exemption amount. Some estate planners have suggested that portability makes it unnecessary to continue to draft estate plans that include credit shelter trusts. Understanding portability involves mastering two new estate tax terms: the basic exclusion amount and the deceased spousal unused exclusion amount (DSUEA). The basic exclusion amount is the surviving spouse's applicable exclusion of $5 million, reduced by lifetime taxable gifts. The DSUEA is the predeceased spouse's applicable exclusion of $5 million, reduced by the sum of lifetime taxable gifts and taxable transfers at death. Although the 2010 Tax Act provides that the $5 million applicable exclusion amount is subject to an inflation adjustment, that adjustment ceases to apply once the taxpayer dies.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Feature,Aug,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Tax legislation , Gift taxes , Estate taxes , Tax exemptions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Can Annuities Offer Competitive Returns?,"In Reichenstein (2009), the author examined the structure of indexed annuities (IA) including equity-indexed annuities (EIA). He concluded that because of their design, IAs must underperform returns on similar risk portfolios of Treasuries and index funds. In this article, he presents the logic to readers of the Journal of Financial Planning. Separately, he discusses a recent critique of his study by VanderPal, Marrion, and Babbel (2011). Using returns data from Ibbotson Associates, he examined historical returns of four EIA contract designs and 13 contracts for 1957-2008. The contracts came From a 1998-2005 database containing $19 billion of real-world annuities from AmerUS and affiliates. He used the Ibbotson Associates data set. This data set has been used in hundreds if not thousands of studies.

Gain Client Loyalty by Understanding Personal Needs,"A representative from a large broker-dealer recently told the author they lose almost 90% of Generation X money. Basically, as soon as kids get their inheritance, they disappear. This is not uncommon. Industrywide, 95% of adult children are not retained by financial professionals who served their parents. First, Gen Xers' sense of loyalty is different from their elders. In past generations, employees and companies were mutually loyal and people spent entire careers in one place. Gen Xers experiencing loss and transition are looking for professionals who understand their grief so they can give them their business. They certainly won't stay just because you held investments for their parents. But if you surprise them by knowing what to say, what to do, and how to support them through the transitions of their lives, they will stay with you now and into the future, and they will tell their friends and associates about you, too.","Florian, Amy", Feature,Aug,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Generation X , Stock brokers , Inheritances , Transitions , Clients , Loyalty , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Can We Predict the Sustainable Withdrawal Rate for New Retirees?,"This paper investigates how well market valuation and yield measures predict the maximum sustainable withdrawal rate people can use with the retirement savings to obtain inflation adjusted income over a 30-year period. The regression framework includes variable to predict long-term stock returns, bond returns, and inflation it produces historical data well. This study suggests that, in projecting long-term sustainability for recent US retirees, a 4% withdrawal rate cannot be considered safe when the cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio has experienced historical highs and the dividend yield has experienced historical lows. Nevertheless, there are important qualifications for these predictions. Most importantly, they depend on out-of-sample estimates, as the circumstances of the past years have not been witnessed before. Readers persuaded by this analysis. May wish to include TPS and other assets in their portfolios, and recent retirees should closely monitor their spending and portfolio balances.

A Better Approach for Tactical Allocation? Looking at Last Year's Winner,"This paper examines annual returns of US large-cap equities and US small-cap equities to see if there is return persistency (momentum) over annual periods between the two asset classes that generates excess return. Five portfolios are created using historical data (1926-2010) from these two asset classes. The returns of the five portfolios were analyzed from 1927-2010 and rolling annual 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year periods. The five portfolios are: 100% large-cap equity portfolio, 100% small-cap equity portfolio (SC), 50/50 large-cap/small-equity portfolio rebalanced annually (50/50), last years winner portfolio (LYW), and last year's loser portfolio. As the length of the annual rolling periods increased, the frequency of the LYW portfolio having the highest rates of return increased. This paper concludes that annual investment return persistence has existed between large-cap equities and small-cap equities, and this persistency effect can be easily captured.","Garrison, Michael M, CFP;Cribbs, Jeffrey G, CFP", Feature,Aug,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Large cap investments , Small cap investments , Asset allocation , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Expected Value of a Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) Annuity Rider,"The analysis conducted for this paper suggests that the probability of a retiree actually needing income from a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) annuity versus the income that could be generated from a taxable portfolio with the same value, is approximately 3.4% for males, 5.4% for females, and 7.1% for a couple, given current prevailing lifetime distribution factors. Based on the results of this study, the guaranteed income protection in a GMWB annuity may be a relatively inexpensive form of longevity insurance especially from a behavioral finance perspective, as retirees greatly fear outliving their retirement income. Although the current guaranteed rate environment is not generally favorable from an absolute average net value perspective, the author contends that GMWB-type features hold significant promise and are a viable strategy for managing longevity risk for a retiree.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,Jul,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Retirees , Annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
An Insurance Bias Re-examined,"In the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the author chided the life insurance industry for being the only industry in America totally unimpeded by progress. He's had it in for life insurance companies ever since he got fired by Manufacturer's Life in 1972. That event is what prompted him to start calling himself a financial planner. He ended up with a huge distrust for life insurance companies and vowed to never be a captive agent again. He kept that vow, but still have maintained his life insurance license for 43 years. The trend to modernization in the life insurance industry is reflected in new life insurance policies and annuities that have ""hybrid"" benefits. Existing life insurance policies and annuities can be converted into new hybrid products. Insurance is a vital component of financial planning; however, it always implies some negative event has to take place to use it.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP", Feature,Jul,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Insurance policies , Life insurance , Life insurance companies , Insurance industry , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Guilt, Ego, and Monthly Paychecks: Threats to Wealth Building","Over the years, the author observed clients who started with very little, controlled their spending, saved regularly, and now have portfolios in excess of $5 million. He's watched other clients with similar incomes start with little and still have little today. Here are his thoughts on three sources of challenge for humans in building and keeping wealth: guilt, ego, and a ""monthly paycheck"" mentality. With apologies to all great mothers highly adept at wielding guilt to manage the behavior of their offspring, the money guilt he's observed seems to be either situationally cultural or event-driven. The high income/modest wealth syndrome can become a huge trap in thinking. You see this most routinely with professional athletes. In his experience counseling clients in financial matters, he has observed that the perspective for humans within an affluent environment has evolved their point of reference for financial decisions. This issue makes thoughtful estate planning so critical.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU", Feature,Jul,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Wealth management , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Data Security in a Tech-Crazed World,"The same electronic tools that have brought so much ease to the lives of financial advisers have resulted in a whole new set of concerns as well. An entire security industry has developed with the express purpose of answering these kinds of questions. Many of the solutions go far beyond the kind of security breaches advisory firms have been experiencing, but that may be what clients need to hear in the end. For some advisers, especially those with larger practices, the safest and most cost-effective move has been to move everything out of their offices and into so-called cloud computing. It's possible to encrypt your software as well -- the applications on which your client files run. This would prevent any hackers or burglars from running your programs at all, whether remotely or within your office. Whatever hackers are doing today to infiltrate computer systems, you can bet they'll have a new strategy tomorrow.

When Life Insurance Is an Investment,"Thinking of life insurance as an investment can cause some financial advisers to curse the subject and reject it out of hand. For example, John, 42, is a very healthy, successful businessman with a wife and two children. He has a net worth of $7 million. He is a commodity trader, and his income fluctuates between a minimal amount to $1 million a year. He has a defined-benefit pension plan with $1 million life insurance in it. He contacted the author recently to discuss a systematic investment/wealth-transfer plan that would give him the flexibility of tapping into it in retirement or using it as additional inheritance for his children. For the purpose of this report, the life insurance policy is low-expense Premier Mutual whole life. The dividend rate is 6%, which will change. In John's case, life insurance was an interesting option for two reasons. First, the estate wealth transfer aspect. The other reason is his desire to keep this asset out of the reach of creditors while continuing to own it for his overall financial security.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Feature,Jul,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Life insurance , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Understanding Risk Tolerance to Remain Compliant,"For practitioners, one of the privileges of membership in the Academy of Financial Services is the opportunity to network with academics whose interest is financial planning. Whether you are an adviser or broker, you are obligated to make recommendations suitable to your customer. On one level, suitability lies at the heart of an effective agent/customer relationship. On another level,avoiding unsuitable recommendations is apt to help you avoid legal and regulatory headaches. In recommending to a customer the purchase, sale, or exchange of any security, a member shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for such customer, upon the basis of the facts, if any, disclosed by such customer as to his other security holdings and as to his financial situation and needs.

A Safer Safe Withdrawal Rate Using Various Return Distributions,"A common conundrum faced by most people approaching retirement is the amount of money they can safely withdraw from their retirement portfolio without the risk of depleting the portfolio over their retirement horizon. The advice that most retirees will hear is the 4% rule -- a retiree who faces normal retirement conditions can make an annual inflation-adjusted withdrawal equal to 4% of the original portfolio without risk of depleting the portfolio. This rule of thumb has helped bring a disciplined approach to retirement withdrawal strategy. However, tests of the 4% rule using simulation methodology have assumed that expected returns are drawn from a lognormal distribution -- an assumption that lacks empirical support. The analysis indicates that a 4% withdrawal rate will result in portfolio failure with greater probability than previously believed, and the truly ""safe"" withdrawal rate -- 2.52% -- is significantly smaller than previously believed.","Athavale, Manoj, PhD;Goebel, Joseph M, PhD", Feature,Jul,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement , Studies , Withdrawals , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

But think, ultimately, the real test today is whether or not you can make everything you do more memorable for people to encounter. In a field that is so fraught with issues of trust and success and all of the psychological elements of life, financial planners really are in a unique position to connect with their clients not just rationally but emotionally. In some sense the only true form of security is doing work you believe in, in a company that you respect, with people you care about and are committed to.

In approaching the challenges of aging and special needs, a growing area of concern to regulators, they need to pay more attention to liquidity.

The Impact of Aging on Retirement Income Decision Making,"The otherwise healthy senior client may experience substantial declines in cognitive function over time, even without clinical dementia. After peaking in middle age, the ability to make effective financial decisions declines. This presents the ongoing challenge to help older clients understand ever more complex retirement income planning. Experts have recommended evaluation of two criteria for determining prudent retirement income strategies: first, clients emotional capacity to deal with risk and uncertainty, and second, their financial capacity to deal with variations in portfolio value, longevity, and income delivery. The authors believe a third criterion should be added -- clients' cognitive ability to grasp and integrate the implications of the retirement income solution. A new retirement income language and presentation skill set are needed to help retirees make better-informed decisions. Because the senior population is so vulnerable, they recommend that all retirement income decision planning and management be delivered by advisers serving in a true fiduciary capacity to their clients.","Kasten, Gregory W, MD, CFP, CPC, AIFA;Kasten, Michael W", Feature,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Aging , Impact analysis , Decision making , Cognitive ability , Studies , Retirement planning , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Can Taxes Save Dollar-Cost Averaging?,"Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment technique commonly suggested by financial planners and investor Web sites. While much empirical evidence casts doubt on the benefits of DCA, this paper investigates whether tax options that arise because of DCA investing are enough to offset its lack of benefits. The study suggests that although DCA does have a tax advantage over lump-sum (LS) investing, the advantage does not make the technique superior to LS. Furthermore, the authors briefly investigate an issue not frequently addressed in the literature, the receipt of dividends, and determine that the inclusion of dividends favors LS as an investment strategy as well. Overall, the results suggest that in many practical scenarios DCA is not as beneficial as practitioners suggest. On the other hand, DCA is not as economically inferior as some academics have claimed.","Atra, Robert J, PhD, CFA;Mann, Thomas L, PhD, CFP", Feature,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Advantages , Lump sum , Averaging income , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Succession Planning Across Generations,"On the face, it seems like succession planning should be a fairly simple conversation. The community is filled with entrepreneurs who set out on their own and build thriving practices. These deals should be happening all the time, yet all the author seems to hear from planners on both sides of these transactions is theyre not happening. When looking at the prospect of selling your practice, it doesn't have to be here today, gone tomorrow. It's quite possible to groom a staff member to become the owner of your firm.

The Portable Exclusion and the Vanishing Bypass Trust,"Last December, Congress made significant changes to the estate and gift tax laws. One surprise was the introduction of a provision that allows the executor of a deceased spouse's estate to transfer the decedent's unused applicable exclusion amount to the surviving spouse. The deceased spouse's unused generation-skipping transfer tax exclusion may not be transferred to the surviving spouse. The married couple must have satisfied several requirements for the surviving spouse to use the deceased spouse's exclusion. The availability of the portable exclusion changes estate planning for couples with large estates in two important ways. First, couples no longer need to transfer assets to a lower-wealth spouse to ensure that both spouses can use their exclusion amounts. The second change the portable exclusion has brought about is decreased use of the bypass trust. The focus in estate planning is now on probate avoidance, asset protection, and distributing the property to descendants in a way that benefits generations to come.","Gardner, Randy, JD, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP", Feature,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Couples , Tax legislation , Gift taxes , Exclusion , Estate planning , Generation skipping tax , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Power Tools for Cognition,"Most financial planners recognize that, from a quantitative viewpoint, many retirees are more interested in having the greatest chance of maintaining their lifestyle than in maximizing the size of their portfolio on their dying day. For years, financial planners have sought to help clients understand the various types of risk they will encounter en route to achieving their financial planning objectives. For retired clients, this often means that short-term portfolio volatility is the risk to be minimized above all others. Clients experience this fear and frustration; they are real. Both financial planners and product designers are at risk of succumbing to a focusing illusion because of it. Yet any focusing illusion among financial planners creates the possibility of granting this fear such a large voice that they unwittingly expose clients to potentially even greater harms to their quality of life: purchasing power loss and distribution formula that produce fixed incomes and cause mounting cash-flow stress.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP", Feature,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Fixed incomes , Retirement planning , Volatility , Risk assessment , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Understanding Flaws in ETF Data,"Exchange-traded funds (ETF) are among the best investment vehicles ever created. They offer extremely low-cost and tax-efficient access to nearly every imaginable asset sliver, allowing individual advisers to build institutional-quality portfolios for pennies on the dollar. At the same time, ETFs come with challenges. Anyone who thinks otherwise should look back at the ""flash crash"" or try to explain to his or her uncle why the US Oil Fund doesn't actually track spot oil. These challenges shouldn't deter you, but they should make you think, if you are going to play in the ETF sandbox, you have to take the time to dig into the data. In this article, the author lays out few examples in which following commonly accepted ETF data will lead you toward disaster, and how -- with a little work -- you can find your way around these problems.","Hougan, Matt", Feature,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Data analysis , Guidelines , Investment policy , Exchange traded funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
What You Need to Know About Active ETFs,"Actively managed ETFs made their debut in the US in early 2008 when Bear Stearns brought the first active fixed-income ETF to the market. However, the launch was ill-timed and the fund went down with the firm. Active ETF are more comparable to active mutual funds. Active ETFs are funds that have portfolio managers behind them making active security selection decisions about what they hold in the portfolio. Investors benefit from several key differentiating factors as a result of the strategy being packaged as an ETF, including: 1. greater liquidity, 2. greater transparency, 3. higher tax efficiency, and 4. lower costs. Of course, no product is perfect. Active ETFs still have relatively short track records, with the oldest active ETFs being fewer than three years old. Another feature of active ETFs that has raised some concern is their high level of transparency.","Nigam, Shishir", Feature,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Advantages , Disadvantages , Exchange traded funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

ETF Trends: Actively Managed Funds Gaining Ground,"Exchange-traded fund (ETF) sponsors are generally not short on creativity and innovation. Following the introduction of specialty indices, the latest trend in the ETF market is actively managed products that employ portfolio managers and seek to outperform passive investments; in other words, products that look and feel a lot like active mutual funds. Meanwhile, some fund advisers are considering converting actively managed mutual funds to actively managed ETFs, says Robert Goldsborough, an ETF analyst with Morningstar. Active ETFs can play the same role in a portfolio as actively managed funds. However, because of the limited number of actively managed ETFs, there currently isn't enough coverage of the market and market sectors to entirely abandon actively managed mutual funds in favor of their ETF counterparts.","Buttell, Amy E", Feature,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Trends , Investment policy , Exchange traded funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Post-Crash Investing Practices Maintain Favor in Rebound,"The more things change, the more they stay the same. FPA's fourth annual Trends in Investing study proves this adage. The 2011 study of 407 financial advisers fielded in February gauged the investment vehicles used by advisers. The latest findings confirm that advisers are maintaining their post-2008 market crash investing philosophy of seeking not just the best returns but the best risk-adjusted returns with a continued emphasis on stability, diversification, and alternatives to long-only strategies. Over the last four years, a few investment vehicles have consistently grown in adviser usage, including exchange-traded funds (ETF), alternative investments, and REITs. The Trends study also found that 22% of advisers currently use or recommend individual alternative investments (specifically those bought directly, not included in other investment vehicles such as mutual funds or ETFs). Although advisers are not willing to return to their pre-crash investing philosophies of more risk/more potential return, they are regaining confidence in the economy.","Schulaka, Carly", Feature,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Trends , Portfolio diversification , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Inflation's Shadow: Investment Offsets and Their Risks,"It's hard to turn on the news without hearing about skyrocketing oil prices or rising food costs. Yet government statistics say core inflation is minimal. It's a harrowing time for financial planners, who are trying to determine the extent to which they need to protect their clients' portfolios from inflation and how to do so without taking on too much additional risk. For now, the countervailing forces between deflation in labor rates and inflation in industrial and agricultural commodities is keeping aggregate inflation low, says Ron Altman, SVP and senior portfolio manager at MD Sass in New York City. It's commonly understood that inflation erodes purchasing power, but the extent of that depletion is often underestimated. In the presence of uncertainty about inflationary movements to come, it doesn't hurt to remember the fundamentals and not lose sight of what is within your clients' control: 1. price matters, 2. price doesn't tell the whole story, and 3. think outside the office.","Budgar, Laurie", Cover Story,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk , Investment advisors , Inflation , Investment policy , Portfolio management , Agricultural commodities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
10 Questions: Scott Spiker on Serving the Middle Class and Financial Planning Beyond Mere Advice,"In an interview, J. Scott Spiker, CEO of First Command Financial Services, talked about business models that work for his advisers and what First Command has learned from its financial behaviors index. The First Command Financial Behaviors Index reveals that 90% of consumers who work with a financial planner say they trust their planner. However, the levels of trust are considerably lower among those who do not have a financial planner. First Command has taken a comprehensive approach to client disclosures for quite some time, and Spiker feels like they are very well positioned for further movement in this direction. He believes the key to developing a profitable business model serving the middle class has very little to do with fee versus commission or assets under management. Success instead lies in taking a holistic approach, offering a broad range of financial products and services within the context of the financial plan.","Nelson, Christina", Interview,Jun,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Middle class , Consumer behavior , Target markets , Business models , United States--US , Spiker, J Scott",ProQuest One Academic

A Cautionary Tale in the SRO Debate,"It is the year 2000 and two 61-year-olds, Bob and Barb, are looking for help in planning for Bob's impending retirement and managing their nest egg. They have been married 37 years and the kids are fully independent. They have a taxable account totaling $80,000 and a $700,000 IRA. They have this money because they have always lived within their means. They have lots of options, especially with the nine-year window providing the flexibility to withdraw as much or as little of the IRA as they with before the required minimum distributions kick in. Most planners would agree that the strategy of taking money out of the IRA before Bob is forced to make withdrawals at his required beginning date is worth considering, given the relatively low tax bracket that would apply. Beyond that basic concept though, the agreement should stop. The answer is a regulatory structure that ignores the financial planning process and is rendered even more ineffective by FINRA.","Moisand, Dan, CFP", Feature,May,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Retirement , Withdrawals , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Five Misconceptions About Document Management,"Every day it seems like technology companies are announcing their latest gadgets aimed at improving people's lives and personal productivity. Financial planners have benefited tremendously from new technologies introduced in the digital age by being able to conduct much of their business while on the go. However, one area of the digital movement that financial planners have been slow to adopt is document management technology. According to Financial Planning magazine's 2010 Technology Survey, nearly 70% of all respondents are not using some form of document management software. Here are five misconceptions regarding document management and explain how embracing this technology can best position a planner's business in the digital age: 1. Server file storage is adequate. 2. Going paperless adds unnecessary risk. 3. Clients want hard copies. 4. Document management software is too expensive. 5.

At the top of a long list of the Finance Committee's priorities this year are creating jobs and continuing the economic recovery. They've seen recent progress on both of those fronts, but there is still significant work to be done. Americans need certainty in the tax code. The increasingly temporary nature of tax incentives and obligations is a serious problem. Last year, Congress addressed 141 expiring provisions, including such basic components as the individual income tax rates, capital gains and dividend rates, and the estate tax. The need for long-term care insurance will not change as a result of health reform, but as the population ages, there will be an increased interest in long-term care insurance.

Incorporating Time into the Efficient Frontier,"The portfolio construction process has historically yielded a two-dimensional output, where the efficiency of a portfolio is determined based on its return and the standard deviation. Risk is usually defined as standard deviation and based on a single holding period: annually. This approach to portfolio construction ignores the fact that investors have varied investing time frames. This research will demonstrate that the relative efficiency of a portfolio changes over various holding periods, and that by adding a third dimension to the optimization process you can create portfolios that are more efficient given an investors expected holding period. An approach is introduced to incorporate time into the efficient frontier, which allows the user to easily adjust the input parameters for mean-variance optimization through the use of a simple time decay factor. This approach has practical implications when building portfolios, such as determining the allocations in a bucket portfolio and determining the equity glide path for a target-date portfolio.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,May,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk factors , Standard deviation , Studies , Investment policy , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Volume and Assets as Determinants of ETF Bid-Ask Spreads,"When trading any exchange-traded security, whether an individual stock or an exchange-traded fund (ETF), investors should always pay attention to the liquidity of the security. Using data from ArcaVision, the authors examine whether ETFs with higher trading volumes tend to have tighter bid-ask spreads and whether this varies across quarters or across asset classes. They find that there is indeed a strong log-linear relationship between spreads and dollar volumes and an equally strong log-linear relationship between spreads and total ETF assets. The overall relationships between an ETF's bid-ask spread and both its dollar volume and its assets under management are clearly negative and log-linear. The correlation is somewhat stronger with volume than with assets, but the difference is small. It is also important to note that this study looks solely at the secondary ETF trading market, which is where smaller-balance investors are likely to trade.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA;Iachini, Michael, CFA, CFP", Feature,May,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Asked price , Securities trading , Exchange traded funds , Liquidity , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

According to Jesse Slome, executive director of the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance in Los Angeles, a planner has three options for addressing clients' long-term care needs. First, recommend solutions yourself by gaining expertise in the various types of long-term care insurance (LTCi) products available. Second, partner with focal LTCi professionals to take advantage of their knowledge, to access solutions and products from multiple insurers, and to keep pace with ever-changing health insurance underwriting standards. Third, do nothing.

Safe Savings Rates: A New Approach to Retirement Planning over the Life Cycle,"Focusing one safe withdrawal rate and then deriving a ""wealth accumulation target"" to achieve by the retirement date may not be the best way to approach retirement planning. The focus of retirement planning should be on the savings rate rather than the withdrawal rate. The safe savings rate"" may be based on historical simulations as the savings rate that proves sufficient to support the desired retirement expenditures from a life-cycle perspective, including both the accumulation and decumulation phases. Unlike the 4% rule for a safe withdrawal rate, there is not a universal ""safe savings rate,"" but guidelines can be created. Starting to save early and consistently for retirement at a reasonable savings rate will provide the best chance to meet retirement expenditure goals. But the savings plan should be adhered to regardless of whether it seems one is accumulating either more or less wealth than is needed based on traditional criteria.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD", Feature,May,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Expenditures , Withdrawals , Retirement planning , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

An Application of Asset-Liability Management for Financial Planners,"Asset-liability management (ALM) provides a risk-management technique that focuses on both sides of an investors balance sheet, in contrast to traditional asset allocation approaches, which tend to only emphasize investor assets. This article presents an application of ALM for financial planners, along the lines of Jones and Brown (2009), using an example of an individual investor who is seeking an asset allocation to best meet future spending needs. This ALM methodology determines the fixed-income exposure required to fully or partially immunize an investor's liabilities, thereby reducing the volatility of the assets required to fund the investors liabilities and the shortfall funding risk of the portfolio. The result takes into account investor circumstances and market conditions in order to allow a financial planner to better fit an asset allocation to the needs of the investor. The goal of this article is to demonstrate this approach and allow financial planners to use ALM in conjunction with existing asset-allocation practices.","Brown, Jack, CFA;Jones, Travis L, PhD", Feature,May,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Studies , Asset allocation , Fixed incomes , Asset liability management",ProQuest One Academic

Negotiations that led up to the enactment of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 appeared to demonstrate a willingness on both sides of the political spectrum to give up some of their demands so that a workable solution for taxpayers could be achieved. Life insurance may be an ideal asset to hold as a hedge against the risks associated with tax-rate changes.

Introducing the 'Debt Policy Statement',"The financial planning principles of debt management have been fairly well understood and articulated for many years. Unfortunately, these principles do not always align with the business reality of firms that sell lending products. In the investment management domain, the industry is evolving from ""sell what you can that will generate good commissions"" to processes for both advisers and consumers that help ensure that the basic principles of diversifying, avoiding emotional trading, and using mechanisms to understand the suitability of investment products are applied in the advice given. Far more so than investing, lending remains a transactional event to apply for another loan. A holistic view is only taken when trying to bail clients out of overwhelming debt. What this paper introduces is a ""Debt Policy Statement"", modeled off of the established Investment Policy Statement process, to educate and set good debt management policies while supporting institutional and governmental lending policies and best practices.","Brayman, Shawn", Feature,Apr,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Consumer education , Debt management , Lending institutions , Risk assessment , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

This article lays out the problem and offers solution. Most estate planners and financial advisers have listened to clients expressing concern about the possible negative effects their money has or will have on their children. One approach adopted by many estate planners and financial advisers is to suggest that their clients consider the use of an incentive trust. An incentive trust attempts to influence beneficiary behavior through the inclusion of carrot/stick provisions related to trust distributions and trusteeships. It would be possible to identify behavioral benchmarks or component skills that are not only objective but that correlate directly with the beneficiary's ability to manage money responsibly.

Planners who take the lead in shaping the use of retirement income planning processes, products, platforms, and practice management solutions for this market will benefit, as will an entire generation of boomer retirees. Retirement education for mid-market clients should be holistic about how to prioritize and manage the risks they'll face in key areas of retirement planning so they improve the sustainability and income optimization of all their assets: Social Security, pensions, savings and investments, home equity, and even human capital such as their health and ability to work.

Portfolio Success Rates: Where to Draw the Line,"A portfolio success rate measures the percentage of all past payout periods supported by a portfolio despite annual withdrawals. Because no methodology can specify an optimal withdrawal rate or portfolio allocation for all clients generally, it is important for advisers to present the risk-return trade-offs in the withdrawal rate decision in a manner that facilitates retirement investment planning. Requiring a high portfolio success rate necessarily requires a low withdrawal rate. In contrast, if a low portfolio success rate is acceptable, then a high withdrawal rate can be used in a financial plan. The principal objective of this analysis is to calculate retirement portfolio success rates for various monthly withdrawal rate assumptions and various portfolio asset allocations from 1926-2009, and show how an adviser can use the findings to manage portfolio withdrawal rates adaptively. The purpose of this research is to assist advisers and clients in forming a plan for annual withdrawals from retirement portfolios.","Cooley, Philip L, PhD;Hubbard, Carl M, PhD;Walz, Daniel T, PhD", Feature,Apr,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Success factors , Monte Carlo simulation , Financial planners , Financial planning , Portfolio management , Success , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Breaking Through: The State of the Risk Tolerance Conversation,"The post-2008 era in financial planning has inspired more self-reflection and practice review than any in recent memory. Client fear, reticence and in some cases, outright rage, have reset advisory relationships for many professionals, even those who are now seeing across-the-board recovery in those same client portfolios today. In this process, many have started -- again -- at the beginning; that is, by reviewing all the terminology related to risk as well as the basic definition of risk tolerance. In January, the Investment Company Institute reported that Americans remain committed to saving for retirement, but they appear to have become more conservative in terms of savings, asset allocation, and choice of retirement age. The financial professionals interviewed for this article agree that the biggest impact heightened compliance rules around risk have had involves how advisers document and handle transactions and recommendations they make in response to client risk assessment.

Their goal is to make sure that tax return preparers are an integral part of both their service and compliance strategy at the IRS.

Self-Centered Marketing: Building a Practice on the Foundation of You,"The self-defeating impulse planners must overcome, marketing-savvy veterans report, is to select and implement marketing tactics before they have developed a strategy on the foundation of who they are, and why they are here. The process does not require a psychotherapist, but the ultimate results can be psychic as well as pecuniary. What typically prompts planners to begin thinking about the need for a marketing plan is not their psychological health, but a dawning recognition that their businesses are languishing, or at least could be doing a lot better. A strategic review does not inevitably lead to a decision to sharpen one's market segmentation. Frank Patzke, the planner who lost clients when junior associates left the firm, makes a conscious choice of taking on ""anybody who wants to be a client."" That guiding principle stems in part from growing up in a blue collar family that could have benefited from the kind of financial advice he gives his clients today.","Stolz, Richard F", Cover Story,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Marketing , Market segmentation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS: Long-Term Care and the Older Women,"According to a recently released AARP research report called Planning for Long-Term Care: A Survey of Midlife and Older Women, 92% of women surveyed say that long-term care refers to ""skilled medical care provided by a nurse or other health care professional."" Eighty-four percent of respondents estimated that the cost per day for a private room in a nursing home is between $200 and $400. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the national average cost is, in fact, $219/day. Most (59%) of midlife or older women have not planned how they will pay for the long-term care they want.","King, Rebecca", Feature,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Women , Older people , Long term health care , Health care expenditures , Financial planners , Market surveys , Long term care insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Change the Way You Ask for Client Referrals,"Financial advisers know that nothing beats referrals from satisfied clients. The problem is that many advisers ask for referrals rather than have referral conversations with clients. Advisers often forget that the reason clients provide referrals is to help their friends, not their advisers. Here are four strategies for making referral conversations more effective: 1. Make it part of the conversation. 2. Seek low-key intros, not high-stress meetings. 3. Bring up referrals at the right frequency. 4. Update referral sources on progress.","Richards, Dan", Feature,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Referrals , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

PRACTICE TRENDS: How Does Your Practice Measure Up?,"In October 2010, FPA conducted a survey of financial planners' fees and financial plan development practices. The average financial planner actively works with just over 96 clients in a financial planning capacity. Sole practitioners, who made up 54% of the planners surveyed, work with fewer clients, an average of 70. Planners working in larger practices handle an average of 126 clients apiece. Overall, financial planners spend the largest percentage of their time meeting with current clients and developing financial plans, each accounting for around 19% of a planner's time. When asked where they would like to spend more of their working hours, the majority of financial planners, more than 60%, said that they would like to spend more time in acquiring new clients and meeting with their current clients. With hourly, retainer, or per-plan fees, sole practitioners charge less than their counterparts in group practices.","McClune, Sheila", Feature,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Polls & surveys , Financial planners , Meetings , Professional fees , Statistical data , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Real-World Index Annuity Returns,"This paper offers the first empirical exploration of fixed indexed annuity (FIA) returns based on actual contracts that were sold and actual interest that was credited. FIAs are designed to have limited downside returns associated with declining markets, and achieve respectable returns in more robust equity markets. Studies that have criticized FIAs are usually based on hypothesized crediting rate formulae, constant participation rates and caps, and unrealistic simulations of stock market and interest rate behavior. When actual policy data are used, the conclusions change. The returns of real-world index annuities analyzed in this paper outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index over 67% of the time, and outperformed a 50/50 mix of one-year Treasury bills and the S&amp;P 500 79% of the time. The study is exploratory, because although it is based on actual contracts and actual crediting rates, the policy data set is neither randomly selected nor comprehensive based upon data provided by 15 FIA carriers.","VanderPal, Geoffrey, DBA, CFP, CLU, CFS, RFC;Marrion, Jack;Babbel, David F, PhD", Feature,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Fixed annuities , Studies , Investment advisors , Indexes , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Marketing's Magic Bullet? Keep It Simple and Consistent,"If the idea of marketing your practice sends your head spinning, relax. The secret to effective marketing may be keeping it simple yet consistent. Recent research from FPA and other industry sources confirms that the majority of planners have no formal marketing plan. And while referrals continue to be the biggest driver of business growth, the most effective marketing happens as a result of implementing a few different strategies -- rather than relying heavily on just one -- and executing those strategies consistently. According to FPA's 2011 marketing survey, nearly 60% of planners have no formal marketing plan, and only 38% of those without a formal plan intend to implement one in the next six months. While people know there is no magic bullet, it can be helpful to know what marketing methods are -- and are not -- commonly used by planners.","Schulaka, Carly", Feature,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Financial planners , Effectiveness , Polls & surveys , Marketing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Transform Your Professional Relationships into Drivers of New Business,"While professional referrals can be one of the best ways to grow a business, the strategy is not for the faint of heart. It takes time, effort, and patience. The rewards, however, are substantial -- strong business growth coupled with a higher level of service for your existing clients. That said, one of the biggest mistakes people can make is setting up a network of professional advisers only with a view to generating referrals. The first step is to define your network needs, and these will differ depending on your clients and their needs. In this case you already have established relationships and your goal is to encourage more referrals. The flipside of this last tactic is a nice segue into the second broad strategy. Clients who indicate that they are satisfied with their professional advisers are the key to new professional relationships.","Littlechild, Julie", Feature,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Referrals , Professional relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
PRACTICE TRENDS: Benefits Offered by Financial Planning Practices,"According to data from the 2010-2011 EPA Financial Planning Salary Survey, which included more than 800 firm-level responses specifically about benefits, many financial planning practices offer benefits with no waiting period and the employer pays for 75% or more of the benefits. About half of firms report that they do not have a waiting period for benefits, bonuses, or incentives. However, 44.6% report a waiting period for benefits, 20.7% for bonuses, and 14.1% for incentives. The most common benefit category offered to employees is time off/paid leave/sick leave, followed by retirement benefits. Most financial planning firms offer a 401(k) to their employees as part of their benefits package. Firms do match a larger percent of the employee's contribution versus the employee's salary. Most financial planning firms (90.4%) offer some type of time off as part of their benefits package.

Transferring Intimacy,"The future existence of the financial planning profession is not heavily dependent on the founding generation's ability to transfer computers, software, staff, systems, processes, technical expertise, and all of the other pieces of a business for some multiple of revenues. Rather, the future existence of the profession is totally dependent on the ability to transfer relationships -- to transfer client intimacy from one generation to the next. Transferring professional intimacy requires acceptance from three parties: an experienced professional who is willing to ""let go,"" a client who accepts the transfer, and a next generation planner who thinks and behaves as a professional and who has credibility with the client. Here are the author's personal observations as to what's necessary to get off the bench: 1. Exhibit professional decorum. 2. Exhibit professional judgment. 3. Exhibit genuine compassion. 4.

Absolute-Return-Oriented Strategies,"Absolute-return-oriented (ARO) strategies are designed to generate consistent, mid-single-digit returns in almost any market environment, with relatively low volatility and downside risk, and low correlation to traditional asset classes and risk factors. While adding ARO strategies to a portfolio may seem compelling in theory, the devil is in the details -- in evaluating the risk and return characteristics of each type of ARO strategy, understanding each manager's investment process, and evaluating their skill in executing their strategy. For those taking a closer look at ARO options, however, the following are research topics to address: 1. lack of track record, 2. complexity of ARO strategies, and 3. benchmarking. Gaining a sufficient level of confidence in the ability of an ARO manager to achieve his or her performance objectives is only part of the job. The question then becomes whether to add the fund to client portfolios, which would typically also entail selling an existing position.","Lowenstein, Alice, CFP", Commentary,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment advisors , Investment policy , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

As discussed in the research report, FPA-ActiFi Adviser Technology Reports: Compliance Edition, sponsored by TD Ameritrade Institutional, compliance systems and solutions should be evaluated beyond the technology choice. Although the majority of advisers do not use compliance software or electronic tools in their practice, of those who do, the most common solution is software provided by National Regulatory Services. The benefit advisers most frequently report receiving by using compliance software or other software for compliance purposes is also the benefit most important to advisers: having more peace of mind and less worry about things falling through the cracks.

Mark's life insurance is viewed as other investments he has, thus the logic of wishing to pursue selling some of his policies to diversify his perceived risk with AB Life. Mark noticed an ad from a local agent promising results, so he called the agent. The agent hooked up with a settlement broker and they were very lucky that during this period a buyer for AB Life did emerge. This wasn't lucky for Mark because this meant large commissions would be subtracted from the purchase price.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Commentary,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Insurance policies , Life settlement , Accelerated death benefits , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Our Highest Value to Clients,"Webster defines wisdom as ""accumulated philosophies or scientific learning, good sense, a wise attitude or course of action."" Many times clients want financial planners to be wiser than they are or even can be. This has caused the author to wonder what wisdom really is and do financial planners have it. He believes technology should always play a subordinate and supportive role to the financial planning process. Financial planners must constantly remind themselves that the planning process, and certainly life planning, is a human process -- technology should support it when appropriate but never dominate. Another interesting aspect of wisdom comes into play when financial planners have to restate an issue or problem for a client. Perhaps wisdom would suggest financial planners recognize that a clients interpretation of most things in life is dynamic and subject to radical change.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP", Commentary,Mar,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Knowledge , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Is Buy and Hold Dead? Exploring the Costs of Tactical Reallocation,"There are important ""costs"" an adviser should consider when implementing a tactical asset allocation strategy for a client. The research conducted for this paper suggests that in order to achieve similar risk-adjusted performance as a static portfolio with the same equity allocation, one must be able to correctly select the outperforming asset class (either bond or equity) approximately 66% of the time, ignoring taxes. In order to achieve similar risk-adjusted performance as a static portfolio with the same equity allocation on an after-tax basis, one must be able to correctly select the outperforming asset class approximately 70% of the time. The likelihood of a tactical approach outperforming a static allocation decreases further when considering additional costs incurred by tactical investors, such as additional trading expenses. Therefore, a long-term static allocation strategy is likely the approach that will lead to higher risk-adjusted performance for the majority of investors.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,Feb,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Asset allocation , Securities analysis , Tax returns , Portfolio investments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

He thinks that the cap-weighted indexes are a very important benchmark for measuring the market, an important part of their toolkit for investment strategies, and are beatable. He also said many investors like to forecast the future by extrapolating the past. The same logic for stocks is equally applicable as a gauge of forward-looking stock market returns. He added that there are always economic dislocations when savings rates change. But the notion that savings and investment are bad things is a warped interpretation of Keynesianism.

The Life to Plan for After a Death,"If there's one word that describes what estate planning attorney Jeff Scroggin considers the most critical piece of advice immediately after a client's death, it's that. Several years ago, Scroggin, JD, AEP, with Scroggin &amp; Co in Roswell, GA, had a client whose family discovered $8 million in original stock certificates in four different safety deposit boxes. He hears this sentiment even today from some older-generation clients. Broadly speaking, post-mortem planning can be broken into estate-tax issues and income-tax issues. Collaborating with an experienced attorney will help financial planners recognize and take advantage of opportunities to increase a survivor's wealth, even if it feels like it might be in the gray zone. In most states, a surviving spouse can elect against the will -- even if the will specifies a certain percentage of assets to go to the spouse, he or she can elect to take what the law allows, usually as much as 50%.","Lee, Shelley A", Cover Story,Feb,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Wills , Post mortem estate planning , Death benefits , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Ten Principles for Effective Grief Support,"In line with the rest of the population, your clients are aging. You've probably helped with many of your clients' life-transition points: mid-life crisis, empty nest, the shift into retirement. The reality is that 70% of widows switch financial advisers within three years after the husband's death. In other words, when you have grief education that equips you to say and do the right things instead of relying on commonly used phrases that offer minimal comfort, you position yourself to keep the clients you have and gain clients from advisers who don't know any better. Here are the ten principles for effective grief support. These include: 1. Realize it is not about you. 2. Every grief is unique. 3. Don't minimize or compare the loss. 4. There are no time limits. 5. No explanation of death is satisfactory to a grieving person. 6. Grieving people need permission to talk about their experience in whatever way makes sense to them.","Florian, Amy", Feature,Feb,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Financial planning , Grief , Death & dying , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Science, Behavior, Art, and 'Nudges'","Going beyond the left-brain analytics of traditional financial planning to facilitate such an outcome is no easy task. To do so requires financial planners to meet clients at the place of their past experiences, viewpoints, values, and, yes, biases. To expect them to see things as they do is to create a gap between them into which even the best financial planning science can fall, unimplemented. Take the case of Kerry and Lauren. Though 11 years apart in age, Kerry and Lauren met as single parents while regularly attending their sons' athletic events. They fell in love, began creating a wonderful life together, eventually married, and bought a new home, financed with a 30-year mortgage. For her part, it mattered deeply to Lauren that Kerry be able to retire at an age that would still allow them to pursue their bucket-list items, including extended periods of travel.

"Slow-Timing the Market, an Alternative Portfolio-Allocation Approach","This article presents an innovative approach to projecting intermediate-term statistical market trends, permitting advantageous adaptations of client portfolio allocations. A simple, automatable algorithmic procedure is put forth for identifying bullish and bearish market trends with durations generally greater than primary-trend durations and less than those of secular trends. The algorithm uses the trailing 12-month average of the constant, 1901-dollar Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index to identify intermediate maxima and minima of the market. Statistical distributions of the major security-index total returns were derived separately for these intermediate-trend bullish and bearish periods spanning the past century and programmed into a Monte Carlo model to test the efficacy of slow-timing the market. The model subsequently statistically projects the behaviors of the portfolio-allocation strategies in accordance with the then-current market trend as each run is projected forward in time. Definite improvements resulted using this approach versus maintaining allocations independent of market trends.","Cohen, D Allen, PhD", Feature,Feb,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Trends , Statistical analysis , Asset allocation , Dollar standard , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Tax-Efficient Stock Investing for Charitable Donors,"This paper presents a tax-efficient stock investing strategy whereby investors who regularly contribute to charity can earn after-tax returns that on average exceed their pre-tax returns. This is accomplished by realizing tax losses on stocks that have declined, while simultaneously using appreciated stocks in lieu of cash to make planned charitable donations. Expected returns can be increased further by using more volatile stocks to implement this strategy. Risk can be controlled by diversifying across multiple stocks. Diversification does not reduce the strategy's tax benefits because accrued gains on donated stocks are never realized and therefore are not offset against capital losses. The improvement in after-tax returns may be smaller if the investor has some long-term gains in the same year, if the stock incurs a loss exceeding $3,000, and/or if the stocks value grows to an amount larger than the planned charitable donation.","Whitworth, Jeff, PhD;McCormack, Joseph, PhD, CFA", Feature,Feb,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Stocks , Donations , Tax returns , Investment policy , Stock , Capital losses , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Pre-Mortem Planning: Creating the Family Care Culture,"The theme of this issue is post-mortem planning. The key to effective post-mortem planning is pre-mortem planning: engaging your client's family in deep, holistic, and substantive conversations about life transitions and challenges to be faced as time marches on, well before one is called to the great beyond. Consider: 34 million Americans provide care for family members or friends 50 years-of-age or older. Given the baby boom tsunami, the number of people needing care before they die will explode. It is not just elder care; 10.6 million Americans care for someone between ages 18 and 49. Of caregivers, 57% care for a parent or parent-in-law; 21% take care of a spouse; and 22% aid siblings, grandparents, other relatives, or friends. Deep, holistic pre- and post-mortem planning goes well beyond money, tax minimization, and the normal precepts of estate planning. It is about life transitions, peace and love in families, meaning and purpose, dignity, teamwork, legacy, and preservation of what matters.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CRC", Feature,Feb,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Families & family life , Caregivers , Estate planning , Disclaimers , Life transitions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Protecting Your Child's Inheritance: The Beneficiary-Controlled Trust,"Post-mortem planning includes passing wealth to the descendants in a manner that protects the wealth for generations to come. In the litigious society, asset protection has emerged as one of the greatest concerns of clients. Parents are limited in terms of what they can do to protect their own property. They can establish limited liability companies and create asset protection trusts offshore or in states with favorable law, but these measures are usually not effective if judicial proceedings against the parents have already been initiated. The child is the beneficiary of his or her own separate trust. The trust assets are retitled directly from the parents' trust to the child's trust. If the child becomes a party to a lawsuit, such as a divorce or creditor action, the trust assets are protected because the child does not have the authority and cannot compel the distribution trustee to make distributions from the trust.","Gardner, Randy, JD, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP", Feature,Feb,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Trust distributions , Limited liability companies , Estate taxes , Beneficiaries , Post mortem estate planning , State court decisions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Inverse and Leveraged ETFs: Considering the Alternatives,"In June 2009, FINRA released Regulatory Notice 09-31 warning about misconceptions prevalent among investors of inverse and leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETF). For those unfamiliar with the products: inverse and leveraged ETFs (and similarly designed mutual funds) have been developed, in theory, to allow market participants to engage in short-term (usually on the order of one trading day) hedging or speculation across any array of market indexes and sectors. Despite the lack of perfect direct or inverse correlation and a slew of other issues, traditional clients without alternatives might still look to these ETFs to meet their investment goals. Fortunately, there exist better investment choices that allow for leverage and have their minimal or positive exposure to volatility: exchange-traded notes and futures and option contracts. A more widespread awareness of the varied and promising alternatives to leveraged ETFs should help investment professionals meet their clients' longer-term needs while avoiding many of the downsides of current ETF-based strategies.","Barnhorst, Bradley C, CFA;Cocozza, Christopher R, CPA, JD", Feature,Jan,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Alternatives , Financial planners , Financial leverage , Futures trading , Exchange traded funds , Options trading , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Healthcare Planning and the New Reality,"In March 2010, Congress and the President enacted sweeping reforms affecting the terms and availability of health insurance for Americans. One of the changes made in the new healthcare legislation that has broad support is the extension of the age that children must attain before they are no longer permitted to be covered under their parents health insurance plan. Many individuals use flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, or medical savings accounts to fund healthcare expenses that are not covered by insurance. While uncertainty about the final direction of healthcare policy abounds, one thing is clear: planners and clients need to consider how these new provisions will affect them before making benefit decisions. In the meantime, keep a watchful eye on changes, which are likely to be enacted as Congress and the President endeavor to make the healthcare legislation more palatable to businesses, individuals, and, of course, politicians.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, CFP, CFA", Feature,Jan,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Health care policy , Medical savings accounts , Impact analysis , Financial planning , Health savings accounts , Flexible spending accounts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Avoiding the Pitfalls of Investment Management Outsourcing,"In a landscape characterized by increased regulatory scrutiny, an uncertain economic environment, and mole competition from newly independent rivals, more financial planners find their strength lies in building relationships with clients and devising an overall wealth-management strategy, rather than executing the nuts and bolts of that particular strategy. Adviser interest in outsourcing is apparent from the results of FPA's 2010 Trends in Investing survey, which found that while 57.5% of advisers surveyed don't outsource at all; the remainder outsource some or all investment management functions. Of those who do outsource all or some investment management, half began to do so in the past five years. For Cindy Richey, CFP, president of Prosperity Planning Inc, in Kansas City, MO, outsourcing only made sense once she found a solution that would simplify her investment management process and allow her to retain as much control as possible.","Buttell, Amy E", Cover Story,Jan,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Competition , Simplification , Polls & surveys , Investment advisors , Outsourcing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Marty Kurtz on Community, Regulatory Reform, and Advancing the Profession","In an interview, Marty Kurtz, president, Financial Planning Association (FPA), talked about his plans for leading FPA this year and where he sees the profession heading in the near future. Kurtz thinks the number one priority for all the members, everyone participating in FPA, to have a better understanding of who they are and how to best use their resources to influence the world around them. As they're seeing this more and more every year, the world needs people helping them with life and money, with financial planning. They're dealing with people and money, so the biggest challenge they face as financial planners is their own weaknesses. He believes that financial planners do not yet totally believe in themselves enough. They still at times apologize for who they are.

An Analytic Approach to Selecting a Nonprofit for Donation,"Charitable giving continues to be an important aspect of the economic and social fabric of the US. The economic crisis has affected nonprofits in two important ways: First, the value of endowments of nonprofits has dropped significantly. Second, the difficult economic environment is affecting donors (individuals and foundations) negatively. In this study, the authors provide a framework for evaluating nonprofits based on a given set of financial and governance criteria. Their framework is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is a widely used tool for solving multi-attribute decision problems. The AHP methodology that the authors propose in this paper can be integrated into a database that contains information on various proxies for nonprofit performance measurement, and can serve as a decision aid for potential donors. They believe that a methodology that allows donors to identify the relative importance of performance criteria will stimulate further research on determining templates of proxies that are appropriate to measure the performance of different types of nonprofits.","Ramirez, Andrés, PhD;Saraoglu, Hakan, PhD", Feature,Jan,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Nonprofit organizations , Selection , Financial planning , Donations , Business metrics , Performance evaluation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Life-Cycle Funds: International Diversification, Reverse Glide Paths, and Portfolio Risk","The recent turbulence of the domestic and international stock markets, most notably the significant decline in 2008 of major stock market indexes, has brought new interest to portfolio diversification and asset allocation strategies. Financial literacy has become more than a buzzword; it has become a credo for financial planners and journalists who seek to educate investors, especially after many investors experienced significant losses. In this paper, several hypothetical life-cycle funds (LCF) are analyzed in terms of volatility risk and probability of failure to teach target values. The methodology of Monte Carlo simulation is applied by using historical rates of return data reported by Ibbotson &amp; Associates for large-cap stocks, corporate bonds, and the MSCI-EAFE Index (international index). The increased awareness of LCFs has no doubt caused many individuals to address the issues of investing for retirement. Nevertheless, the asset allocation strategies of many LCFs may not provide the best portfolio risk protection when measured in terms of probability of reaching a specific portfolio target.","Schleef, Harold J, PhD;Eisinger, Robert M, PhD", Feature,Jan,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Lifecycle funds , Monte Carlo simulation , Stock exchanges , Asset allocation , Risk management , Portfolio diversification , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

As their firm's chief compliance officer, he's also been delving into the new ADV Part II requirements and he has been receiving several comments from colleagues regarding SEC chairperson Mary Shapiro's reported $9 million parting gift from FINRA. The financial reform package mandates that the SEC study the fiduciary issue and report back in January. It also gives Shapiro and company the power to enact rules. Instead of stepping up to the plate and being regulated as advisers when brokers give advice, the brokerage lobby seems to be pushing the SEC to lean toward a rules-based system where if you disclose, you are okay. That may work for the FINRA world, but it conflicts with the principles embedded in centuries of fiduciary law.","Moisand, Dan, CFP", Commentary,Jan,2011,Journal of Financial Planning," Reforms , Investment advisors , Fiduciary responsibility , Scandals , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Is Your Firm Prepared for Alzheimer's?,"More than 1 in 5 women and 1 in 10 men will develop Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's can be emotionally and financially devastating for patients, caregivers, and their families. It is a progressive disease which means the condition will never improve and will only get worse. People with Alzheimer's or many other forms of dementia will eventually be unable to manage their own affair, and will be entirely dependent on others for care. Proactive planning can significantly improve quality of life for people who suffer from Alzheimer's and for their caregivers. However, there are few federal or state laws that guide appropriate actions or clarify your liability when working with clients with Alzheimer's. Clients who have dementia may present your practice with legal and ethical challenges. A written policy for how you will work with clients with dementia may help you avoid ethical and legal dilemmas. This is a wonderful opportunity for you to highlight the value of your services and also develop your business.","Starnes, Steve, CFP", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Alzheimers disease , Financial planners , Client relationships , Professional ethics , Caregivers , Dementia , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
An International Perspective on Safe Withdrawal Rates: The Demise of the 4 Percent Rule?,"For retirement savings that are not annuitized, an important and difficult question for retirees regards finding a safe withdrawal rate that will provide as much retirement income as possible without exhausting their savings. The starting point for advice on this issue in the modern era is Bengen (1994), who famously motivated the 4% withdrawal rule using historical simulations. Numerous studies on sustainable withdrawal rates with various tweaks and modifications followed the early research. It is widely acknowledged and understood that the applicability of these withdrawal rate studies depends on the future behaving with the same patterns as the past. The author said their approach for obtaining a better idea about the implications of lower asset returns on sustainable withdrawal rates is to replicate the methodology of Bengen (2006a) using 109 years of financial market data for 17 developed market countries. With the SAFEMAX criterion, and from all international perspective, the 4% real withdrawal rule has simply not been safe.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Monte Carlo simulation , Withdrawals , Savings , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
PRACTICE TRENDS: Advisers Report Benefits from Financial Planning Software,"In the past, financial planning was largely investment-driven, and financial plans tended to be updated annually. Financial planning software mirrored this simplicity. However, financial planning has evolved to become more complex and holistic. Today's clients are more sophisticated and expect a greater level of interactivity and access to their financial planners. Clients expect a real-time, interactive experience that goes beyond the scope of mere investment management. The focus has moved from adviser-driven functionality to usable client information. In addition, many advisers have altered their presentation approaches to take advantage of this. More than three-fourth, of the 347 advisers surveyed who use financial planning software say they are satisfied with it. The most important benefits to these advisers are better client service/satisfaction, more effective communication with staff or clients, increased productivity, and the ability to serve a larger number of clients. Many advisers report that the use of financial planning software has a major effect on the effectiveness of the customer service they provide.","Ritchlin, Lance", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Software , Financial planning , Polls & surveys , Technology adoption , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Power of Money,"Money is neutral, it has no personality, it is merely a commodity. Some spend too much money, others are so frugal they cannot enjoy what they've earned, and still others don't want to talk about their relationship with money at all -- which makes your job as a financial planner that much more difficult. Over the years in the author's work as a family therapist, management consultant, and family wealth consultant, he has learned there are three primary reasons people struggle emotionally with money: culture, childhood conditioning, and psychological make-up. To be effective, financial planners need to understand how these three things unconsciously influence their clients, and how they can begin to counteract this unconscious conditioning. Financial planners are in an ideal position to help their clients discover their core values and purpose in life. Helping your clients break free from their unconscious patterns and money scripts so they can live a rich and fulfilling life may be the most significant gift you could give a fellow human being.","Pullen, Courtney", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS: Use Demographic Resources to Target Specific Audiences,"According to the US Census Bureau there were just over 112 million households in the US in 2008. With approximately 300,000 financial planners in the US, the average number of households per planner is over 370. With this large a pool of potential clients, it is helpful to employ market segmentation to more effectively prospect for clients and hone skills for more effective client service. You should also investigate what industry resources and groups are active and how many professionals participate in each. If you know you want to focus on serving individuals in your local area, county or state income information call help you decide where to locate your office and/or which areas are good for prospecting or advertising. Regardless of the reason, segmentation by age and income can help you more effectively target your marketing and gain the skills and style that will appeal most to your ideal client.","King, Rebecca", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Demographics , Financial planners , Data collection , Target markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
It's Time for a New Retirement Model for the Middle Market,"Baby boomers are retiring at the rate of 1 every 10 seconds, and will continue to do so for the next 15 years. One of the most serious challenges facing the financial planning industry today is how to help middle market boomers make informed retirement income decisions. Best practice guidelines are needed to help planners effectively help Americans retire with confidence. The Society of Actuaries has initiated research to help the financial services industry address this important need, and reports its Phase I and II findings in ""Segmenting the Middle Market: Retirement Risks and Solutions."" Analysis of the consumer segments revealed that at the midpoint for each, middle mass segments will depend primarily on Social Security, with additional lifetime income or earned income needed to either meet essential expenses or secure a moderate lifestyle. Making an informed decision about the timing of retirement and when to take Social Security benefits are critical decisions for the middle mass segments.","Seibert, Kevin S, CFP, CRC, CEBS;Meredith, Betty, CFA, CFP, CRC", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Models , Baby boomers , Financial planners , Decision making , Market segments , Social security , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Getting Beyond Our Biases,"In some of the talks that the author gives, he mentions that when a financial planner dies and stands in front of the pearly gates, if offered a choice between heaven and a lecture on heaven, they will choose the lecture. While studies are necessary to create a framework around decision making, it is experiences that are the substance. Today, planners live in models. They create models for withdrawal rates that are derived from models on expected inflation and investment returns. Clients have interpreted their market experiences and those experiences relate to their views of money. One of the cognitive biases from which planners suffer is group polarization. Groups tend to be more extreme than the average individuals in the group. It is useful to check outside the group to get feedback on your biases. Building relationships with non-industry people can broaden your horizons. You need to somehow distinguish between your truth and others' truths.","Levin, Ross, CFP", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Experiential learning , Bias , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Tailoring Client Communications,"You just completed an initial meeting with prospective clients, a couple in their early 60s who were referred to you by a long-time client. From a business perspective, they were an ideal fit for your firm's services. But you sensed some discord in the meeting. Communicating about personal financial matters should be fairly straightforward. Money is money: it's a quantifiable entity. Advisers and clients -- including partners in a couple -- often have different personalities, communications preferences, and learning preferences. Financial planners tend to classify people by their perceptions of their personality type: aggressive, submissive, intellectual, and so on. Recognizing a personality type or profile is useful, but the value of that information results from understanding how personality influences communications preferences. Gender-stereotyping is politically incorrect, but nonetheless, gender differences are a key factor to consider in assessing communications styles and learning preferences.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Communication , Preferences , Personality traits , Client relationships , Personality , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

As long as you're not creating enough jobs to bring down unemployment in a substantive way, most Americans won't think that the recession has ended. If prices for an asset or asset class are rising strongly and have been rising consistently strongly for an extended period, that's certainly a necessary condition for some kind of a bubble and a future financial crisis.

Would Someone Please Tell Me What My Policy Is Worth?,"In today's climate of tax uncertainty, it should come as no surprise to hear that the Treasury regulations governing the valuation of life insurance policies for gift tax purposes not only do no more than approximate the value of the gift, but they are based on the use of a factor that is generally impossible to calculate. When the IRS published Treas. Reg. §25.2512-6, there were only two types of insurance policies available for purchase: whole life and annual renewable term. Unfortunately, there is no guidance for gift tax purposes regarding which reserve is to be used when attempting to comply with the ITR requirement of Treas. Reg. §25.2512-6. Moreover, the life insurance industry is not in agreement about which reserve is to be used when attempting to comply with the Treasury regulations.

MARKETING TO CONSUMERS: Using Consumer Perceptions to Shape Marketing Messages,"While most individuals expect to leave behind at least a small inheritance and plan to retire and live at least to the age of 75, there are several fears that prey on their minds regarding future expenses and governmental changes.

One in five individuals thinks that medical expenses will eat up all of their savings in the next five years. Eight in ten individuals think it's likely they will leave an inheritance worth $10,000 or more (including property and other valuables). Even within the context of the perceptions, only just over half of individuals expect to be working after the age of 62.

Using a Hierarchy of Funds to Reach Client Goals,"The financial planning and investment industries use a common mental map, a framework that serves to focus, simplify, and constrain thinking and recommendations. This framework, modern portfolio theory, is deeply embedded in the psyche of financial advisers and is applied to institutions as well as individuals, including individuals at or near retirement. Modern retirement theory (MRT) suggests that historical long-term averages may not apply in individual client scenarios and seeks to offer a sustainable benefit to individuals. It proposes a perspective on retirement planning that seeks to meet the individual client's retirement goals under any market condition or life event. The MRT standard is that individual retirement goals are absolute and therefore must result in a sustainable lifestyle throughout the retirement phase. To this end, MRT seeks to employ strategies that meet the client's stated objectives in any market climate, mitigate and transfer longevity risk and conditions within longevity risk, are tax efficient, and maximize assets by disbursing the client's retirement sheet assets into four broad categories.","Branning, Jason K, CFP;Grubbs, M Ray, PhD", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Objectives , Risk management , Retirement planning , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

He said planners can't approach this as if this is the first time you're ever having a conversation with this person. Planners need to understand their values and what's most important to clients in their lives so they have a pretty good idea about what really matters to them. Most of our clients who retire spend more money the first few years they're retired, not less. An assumption is you're going to spend less money when you retire. That's ridiculous.

5 Social Security Strategies for Couples,"One of the bigger decisions advisers face in developing retirement income strategies for their clients is when the clients should begin collecting Social Security benefits. Identifying optimal Social Security strategies can help clients maintain their quality of life and may result in a significant increase in benefits collected over their lifetimes. The first step in Determining the needs should be to figure out how much income clients will need in retirement and where this money will come from. Social Security usually provides at least 20% of pre-retirement income. When your clients want to retire and whether they want to keep working for income in some capacity during retirement are, of course, key questions. Clients can certainly begin drawing their Social Security benefits at age 62, but there is no requirement to do so and the benefits of waiting can be significant: approximately an 8% annual increase in benefits in real terms for every year they delay taking benefits from ages 62 to 70.","Fahlund, Christine S, PhD, CFP", Feature,Dec,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Couples , Guidelines , Financial planners , Social security , Retirement planning , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Planners Find Success with Retirement Income Strategies,"As America ages, clients are demanding mote retirement income planning products and services, and planners are stepping up to meet that demand. Whether a planners primary strategy for providing retirement income involves a systematic withdrawal, time-based segmentation, essential versus discretionary income, Social Security and pensions, or a combination of strategies, planners are generally successful at executing retirement income planning. The increase in retirement income planning may simply be attributed to the fact that each year more baby boomers are closer to retirement. However, it may also be thanks to a shift in attitude. In 2010, planners report that 60% of their clients in or near retirement have made no significant changes to their retirement plans; this is the same finding as the 2009 survey.

Consistent Asset Allocation,"Investors may have different levels of willingness and ability to adjust portfolio allocations. This paper outlines how to make sure investment horizons and opinions are consistently combined into an asset allocation using simple concepts from modem portfolio theory (MPT). The inputs into the asset allocation decision framework should be consistent with the clients willingness and ability to adjust his or her holdings. Another method of forecasting returns uses key historical economic and financial data to develop a small-scale macroeconomic model of future returns. In creating the framework for MPT, Markowitz did not suggest that returns are stable or independently and identically distributed across time. Rather, he acknowledged that the returns depend on the investment opportunities that are available at a point in time. Simply using MPT as a black-box, where you input historical averages, standard deviations, and correlations can give incoherent portfolios that are inconsistent with your outlook.","Jacobsen, Brian J, PhD, JD, CPA, CFP", Feature,Nov,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Models , Investors , Forecasting , Asset allocation , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Efficiently Monitor Client Cash Flow,"As another calendar year wanes, clients turn to financial planners for strategies to maximize opportunities related to the end of the year. Many of the year-end planning strategies prepared by financial planners are contingent on knowing a client's income, expenses, and cash flow for the period. It is also a time when planners review events over the past 12 months and assess a client's progress to an existing financial plan. Planners implement a variety of techniques to gather data related to a client's cash flow. The level of detail collected largely depends on the comprehensive nature of the planning provided for a client. To help simplify personal income and expense tracking for clients, planners often recommend clients use desktop personal finance software. Instead of asking clients to manually track transactions or consistently download and review them in personal finance software, planners are turning to one of the most efficient tools available to automate personal finance management.","Winterberg, Bill, CFP", Feature,Nov,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Clients , Automation , Cash flow , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Business Continuation Planning, Part 2","The second part of a two-part series dealing with planning for the continuation of a closely held business, commonly referred to as buy-sell planning is presented. This follow-on business continuation article presents two case studies as a way of identifying different situations and possible planning solutions. For purposes of space and greater clarity, business continuation planning for permanently disabled shareholders has been ignored. Sam and Pranab are co-owners of Engineering Consulting Associates. Twenty years ago they instituted a buy-sell agreement funded life insurance. JOC is a corporation. The four senior orthopedic surgeons are its shareholders. For some 10 years, life insurance issues have been a constant source of irritation among the doctors. The planning that justified purchasing life insurance policies to informally fund a deferred compensation plan 10 years ago was seriously flawed.

"William Reichenstein on Retirement Investing, Withdrawals, and Tax Efficiency","In an interview, Bill Reichenstein, PhD, CFA, talked about retirement investing, withdrawals and tax efficiency. When he says retirement accounts, he's talking about the 401(k) and the Roth. With the taxable account, the government is taxing the returns each year. So, you're only going to get some of the returns because the government is going to take some of the returns, and the Roth, of course, is growing tax-exempt. So, you get all the returns. You can make that portfolio last a few years longer by tax efficiently withdrawing the funds. Two key concepts again, the taxable accounts are taxed the most heavily and the retirement accounts taxed more favorably. The optimal assets to hold in the taxable account are assets on which you're going to allow the capital gains to grow unrealized and unharvested for long, long periods, ideally, until retirement. If he wants a 50% stock allocation, he has got to hold tax efficient stock funds in a taxable account.","Buttell, Amy E", Interview,Nov,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Withdrawals , Roth 401k plans , Tax returns , Taxable income , Retirement planning , United States--US , Reichenstein, Bill",ProQuest One Academic

'Not to Be' Is No Longer an Option,"In a twist on the famous phrase ""To be, or not to be"" from Hamlet's soliloquy in Act III, Scene l of Will Shakespeare's play, the SEC has taken a major step that was over 10 years in the making. The SEC has adopted a new ""2B"" and the effect on the development of financial planning as a profession is profound. As a result of the SEC's action, the public now has a significant tool in FORM ADV, PART 2B that provides important disclosures about the person providing advice, not just the firm they represent. As financial planners progressed in their work, some of the government regulators in their group became aware that the SEC was working on changes to FORM ADV, Part U. CFP Boards rules clearly stated that providing FORM ADV, PART II satisfied the disclosure requirements for certificants.

The Effect of Emergencies on Retirement Savings and Withdrawals,"This paper explicitly considers the risk that large extra withdrawals may be required for emergencies. These very large extra expenses might not even be on the radar screen at the beginning of retirement. The uncertainty about emergencies in this paper is integrated with the uncertainty about investment returns. This paper shows that after allowing for a reasonable risk for emergencies that only close to 3% can be withdrawn initially to provide the same sustainability as a 4% withdrawal. Significantly more savings are required to sustain a given standard of living. This paper explicitly considers the risk that large extra withdrawals may be required The sustainability of investment withdrawals depends on uncertainty about the returns to be earned on the investment and the expenses to be covered by the withdrawals. The effect of uncertainty about the returns has been extensively studied in various papers, but little attention has been paid to uncertainty about the expenses to be covered.","Pye, Gordon B, PhD", Feature,Nov,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Emergencies , Uncertainty , Retirement planning , Rates of return , Risk assessment , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Over the years, many variables have been considered to have some predictive power for the market. The authors added a few of these variables (S&amp;P 500 dividend yield, 90-day Treasury bill yield, whether the Fed was in a tightening or loosening mode) to the default and term premium variables as well as the mutual fund cash variable and analyzed the results over the same 10 years.

Changing Strategies for Philanthropic Giving: Implications for Financial Planners,"The objective of this article is to explore some new thinking so that financial planners can assist both the philanthropy of high-networth individuals and the nonprofits who seek to increase revenues. This article discusses the cause and nature of change in the meaning of philanthropy among those who provide resources to social problem solving, and presents a series of implications for financial planners both as private advisers and as members of nonprofit leadership teams. To all of the complexity of today's financial and regulatory scene, financial planners and advisers must add the growing complexity of philanthropy and philanthropic innovation. Few people revel in the prospect of added complexity to their work or their lives. Unfortunately, as the lawyers are fond of saying, the facts are recalcitrant.

"Tax Planning for Uncertain Times: Opportunities, Flexibility, and the Long View","With Congress struggling to come to grips with the politically thorny expiration of the so-called ""Bush tax cuts,"" practitioners are grappling with both short-term and longer-term tax planning opportunities for their clients. At the same time, planners are also encouraging clients to weigh important non-tax variables when plotting out wealth-building strategies. Whatever the outcome of the immediate ideological battle in Washington over federal marginal income tax rates and brackets, in 2013, higher income earners will face a pair of tax hikes that were enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 that may shape tax planning strategies for some clients. Another important tax planning consideration is the consensus opinion that preferential tax treatment for long-term capital gains will remain embedded in the Internal Revenue Code, even if the maximum rate rises significantly above today's 15% ceiling. Other tax-planning opportunities may be open to executives through maximizing certain employee benefits.","Stolz, Richard F", Cover Story,Nov,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Tax rates , Roth 401k plans , Tax planning , Investment policy , Tax cuts , Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act 2010-US , Tax increases , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Life Transitions and Generational Timelines,"To focus on trends in financial planning, closely examine the confluence of demographics and economics. How you think about financial planning, how you frame your goals and objectives as an adviser, the tools that you embrace, and the conversations that you have with a client also are colored by generational timelines. While most of the practicing financial planning pioneers from the 1970s are Traditionalists, the bulk of today's experienced practitioners are boomers. The oldest boomers are approaching retirement, yet many do not have a succession plan. The Millennial Generation, also known as Generation Y, GenNext, the Google Generation, the Echo Boom, or even the Tech Generation, is the fastest-growing segment of workers today.

The Bonding Continuum in Financial Planner-Client Relationships,"All planner-client relationships reflect degrees of bonding and are potentially enduring and endearing. However, only a small subset achieves that status. Based on a survey of financial planners, only 13% meet the dual criteria of an especially strong bonding relationship: planners selected by a client to be contacted in cases of an emergency and planners selected to be the sole or co-executor of a client's will. This paper discusses implications of ties that bind, highlighting the risks and rewards of bonding relationships along the bonding continuum. Compared to weak bonders, strong bonders are more likely to have mediated conflicts or been involved in an intervention to get a client into therapy or drug treatment among other behaviors that create special ethical issues for bonders. Strong bonders are more likely to agree that coaching helps them do a better job as a financial planner and that coaching has improved the communication between clients and their family members.","Dubofsky, David, PhD, CFA;Sussman, Lyle, PhD", Feature,Oct,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Ethics , Correlation analysis , Studies , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Weighing the Risks: Are Exchange-Traded Notes Right for Your Clients?,"This paper introduces readers to the exchange-traded note (ETN) structure. It provides a discussion of the differences between the ETN and exchange-traded fund (ETF) structures. The authors examine ETN credit risk in light of their underlying structure. They show that credit risk is a declining function of redemption frequency and that credit risk is a declining component of the total risk when redemption opportunities increase. If credit risk can be accurately estimated, investors can mitigate credit risk by purchasing ETNs with frequent redemption opportunities. However, given the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the demise of the Opta ETNs, investors should remain cautious, but realistic, when evaluating the credit risk of ETN issuers. ETNs offer a tax-preferred way to provide clients exposure to unique trading strategies, as long as the financial planner follows the guidelines, which involve ETNs with frequent redemption opportunities when issued by highly rated investment firms.","Smith, Jeffrey, PhD;Small, Kenneth, CFA, CFP", Feature,Oct,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Investment policy , Exchange traded funds , Credit risk , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

They can be sued by a client for alleged malpractice, by their peers or their professional association for an ethical violation, by the Internal Revenue Service investigating a client or for the adviser's questionable tax advice, or by the SEC for securities violations. Many advisers believe their client files, notes, e-mails, and conversations are confidential and do not have to be turned over if the government or all opposing attorney subpoenas them, similar to the privilege that exists between a doctor and patient or attorney and client. Although financial advisers under the CFP Board Code of Ethics are required to keep client records confidential, financial advisers, even if they are not the target of the proceeding, must testify and/or produce records in response to subpoenas. Recent cases against accountants indicate that the traditional protections afforded professional documents are eroding.

Studies consistently highlight a gap between men and women in terms of their needs and involvement in the management of their personal finances and investment assets. Many financial advisers do not fully appreciate the differences between the financial styles of women and men, and fail to address women's needs or play to their strengths. Women have the capacity to effectively plan and manage their finances, but many lack the knowledge, skills, and experience to make decisions about their money and resources. They would like to find advisers who will educate and empower them, but too many distrust the financial services sector. As a profession, financial planners can build trust with a female clientele by a thoughtful and comprehensive review of all aspects of their practice, including their planning process, their subject matter expertise, and their relationship management. In their relationship management, planners should consider the collaborative and community-oriented style in which women traditionally learn.","Blayney, Eleanor, CFP", Feature,Oct,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Women , Financial planning , Decision making , Financial literacy , Empowerment , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

If you really know your stuff, you can make sure your clients end up with more money than they ever had and more of it tax-free. You really have to look through a client's balance sheet and see what kinds of money they have. Basically all clients have four kinds of money: cash, capital gain property, tax-deferred 401(k)s and IRAs, and then the tax-free category, like Roth IRAs and life insurance. The goal, really, is to get the first three categories into the last one, to start moving everything to tax-free territory. There are actual taxes that could affect people's investments.

"Back to School: Past, Present, and Future","By the end of 2008, financial planners whose clients had agreed to implement mid-course corrections in their withdrawal amounts would have been asked to take a small reduction in their pre-tax distributions, and the resulting withdrawal rate for 2009 would have been in line with policy-based safe withdrawal rate levels given an undervalued market environment. For retirees also receiving Social Security and/or pension income, this most likely generated an overall decrease in their after-tax income of less than 5%. Looking back, people can now say that clients ""unlucky"" enough to have retired in 2000 but who were fortunate to have advisers who implemented such distribution, rebalancing, and replenishment policies likely found themselves in pretty solid financial shape, all things considered, entering their second decade of retirement. For starters, take rebalancing.

Nearly three-quarters said they were changing their strategies. Not only are planners re-evaluating the types of investments they recommend, but they are changing their recommendation strategies. In looking at the types of investments recommended, the biggest decrease has been in the number of advisers surveyed who said that they recommended individual stocks.

Finding the Planning in Financial Planning,"After four decades, the financial planning profession still lacks an overarching framework for organizing and testing the strategy-making (that is, ""planning"") activities of its practitioners. An integrating framework is proposed that consists of five modes of strategy-making: planner-driven, data-driven, policy-driven relationship-driven, and client-driven. Each of these five modes represents a different relative role for the planner and client in the planning process. The modes also fall along a parallel dimension of planning versus emergence. Client complexity is also analyzed as a predictor of client trust and commitment, and it is found that trust and commitment are inversely related to the complexity of a client's circumstances. Finally, a factor analysis of planner strategy-making activities shows that planners in independent firms tend to favor data- and policy-driven approaches and those practicing at large financial services firms tend to be more dominant in the planner-driven mode.","Yeske, David B, DBA, CFP", Feature,Sep,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Discriminant analysis , Investment policy , Financial services , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

In addition, one in five individuals say they are extremely satisfied with their job.

However, for those who are less satisfied, the lack of advancement opportunities is a key factor along with those two elements. In addition to self-identified drivers of satisfaction levels, the 2010 Financial Planning Salary Survey also collected information on job and practice characteristics to confirm whether there is a correlation between the drivers individuals perceive as contributing most to their satisfaction and actual satisfaction, and identify other drivers of satisfaction that the individual may not actively recognize.

The presence or absence of a retirement program provided by a client's employer plays an important part in helping clients plan for the future. Yet not all employers provide this benefit, and not all workers take advantage of it even when it is provided.

Every time you learn a skill involving human persuasion, you can use it for good or for bad. In financial planning, the current value that planners are giving is so miniscule compared to what they could be doing that Ariely thinks that there is a lot of room for using behavioral economics for everyone's benefit.

MARKETING TO CONSUMERS: Consumer Spending Provides Keys to Client Service,"To market your financial planning services successfully, it helps to know something about the spending habits of Americans, and how those patterns relate to households in various income brackets. This article analyzes some of the data from the 2008 Consumer Expenditure Survey to help planners better identify and segment the consumer market for marketing purposes. If the good news is that spending is increasingly modestly, the bad news is that incomes are barely increasing at all. The 1.7% increase in household expenditures from 2007-2008 more than doubled the percentage of income gains. The government estimates that households increased their food expenditures 5.1% from 2007-2008. More than two-thirds of retirees' income comes from Social Security and benefits from private and government retirement accounts.

Roth Accounts: Seeing the Forest for the Trees,"There are four distinct types of scenarios in which a decision can be required regarding the possible use of a Roth account: 1. Roth conversion tax cost funded through taxable assets, 2. equal contributions to Roth and traditional IRAs, 3. Roth conversion funded through qualified account proceeds, and 4. Roth contributions vs. grossed-up traditional contribution. This article provides an analysis framework for advisers to take several key factors into account and provide investors with a robust and consistent way of making decisions involving conversions and contributions to Roth accounts. Most investors consider qualified accounts to be assets. But a qualified account balance includes both assets and liabilities. The balance includes a deferred liability attributable to the income tax the investor would owe if he withdrew the entire account balance. The deferred liability is essentially a debt, and Roth conversion may be seen as an opportunity to prepay it.","Kenigsberg, Matthew B, CFA", Feature,Sep,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Conversion , Roth IRAs , Contributions , Roth 401k plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

That practice is about to change with the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008's cost-basis reporting provisions. The new rules phase in from Jan 1, 2011, through Jan 1, 2013, depending on the security's type. The new regulations cover several topics, including: 1. Default cost-basis assumptions and lot specification. 2. Brokers must provide cost-basis information for covered securities when transferring assets. 3. Gifted and inherited shares transferred between accounts must be identified and gain/loss must be accounted for. 4. Brokers must account for wash sales within single accounts. All sources agree that the key to a successful transition is to review workflows and systems and communicate with custodians, tech vendors, and clients.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP", Cover Story,Sep,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Provisions , Financial planners , Brokers , Emergency Economic Stabilization Act 2008-US , Compliance , Reporting requirements , Tax basis , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Getting Past the Past,"In the aftermath of 2008, the winds of change have been blowing for financial planners. Financial reform efforts have been all over the map. Every other day for months now, the story seems to change. While all these was going on, planners would hear about the Financial Planning Coalition. A few thought it was horrible that CFP Board, Financial Planning Association, and National Association of Personal Financial Advisors would ever speak to each other, let alone agree with each other about anything. Financial planning, financial planners, and planning clients need advocacy. As flawed as these organizations have been, are today, and will be tomorrow, they need them and they need their constructive criticism. It is a wonderful change to see these groups collaborating, and financial planners should benefit from their consumer efforts as well as forays into professional issues.","Moisand, Dan, CFP", Commentary,Sep,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Changes , Associations , Advocacy , Collaboration , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Flaws of Our Financial Memory,"The history of financial markets is filled with cases of amnesia and collective dementia. Classical reference texts on stock market bubbles and crises have noted that past episodes of financial euphoria have been repeatedly fueled by similar mixes of loose credit, market deregulation, financial innovation, and greedy investors. In this article the author suggests that research findings in the field of cognitive neurosciences can inform investors about the flaws and errors of one's financial memory and lead to new insights about how these flaws of memory can be overcome in everyday investment decisions. In the next section he will demonstrate how these memory flaws act in common financial decision-making processes and may lead to a distorted view of past decisions. Subsequently, he will show how investment diaries and investment policy statements may help investors and advisers prevent some of these shortcomings.","Klement, Joachim, CFA, CFP", Feature,Aug,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Cognition & reasoning , Memory , Decision making , Studies , Investment policy , Investments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How to Build a Niche Practice,"In a profession that finds itself between a rock and a hard place -- increasing client expectations and decreasing client assets -- financial planners are taking a second look at niche practices as a potential solution to their economic woes. This concept is not a new one. In 2005, Mark Tibergien and Rebecca Pomering identified eight different strategies a planning practice could use to grow and to differentiate itself from the competition. Their work, conducted in conjunction with Moss Adams LLP, found most advisory firms to be generalists. Another differentiator, the distinct but similar ""technical specialty firm"" accounted for another 11% of strategies deployed. These firms focus on an internal specialty such as executive stock options or charitable gift planning. This article will consider both kinds of firms with an emphasis on the niche market firms. All the advisers interviewed by the Journal agreed that serving niche clients does not entail getting rid of your existing clients.","Grote, Jim, CFP", Feature,Aug,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Competition , Specialists , Niche marketing , Donations , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Overcoming Hiring Hurdles,"Securing a first job is certainly a chore no matter what industry is chosen, but with financial planning's infancy, lack of a professional career track, and even a dearth of internal career tracks, the challenge for new planners is monumental. Recent research released by FPA states that 84% of firm owners rely on word of mouth/networking to recruit new hires. Here are some additional strategies firms may want to consider in recruiting new planners: 1. Participate in Career Day programs. 2. Attend career fairs on college campuses. 3. Participate in internship and/or mentoring programs. 4. Use industry-specific job sites such as financialplannerjobs.com, and association sites such as FPA and NAPFA. 5. Post an ad in a newspaper or industry publication. 6. Work with a coach, practice management consultant, or recruiter. 7. Utilize non-industry-specific online job boards such as monster.com and careerbuilder.com.

Managing Retirement Income for the Mid-Market,"Planners need to know how to guide retirees and near retirees through a maze of sometimes contradictory goals and trade-offs while managing retirement resources to last over a period of uncertain length and expense. They need to be able to tailor their advice to the unique circumstances of individuals who are most at risk of running out of money during retirement. Retirement income planning builds on what you already know about accumulating assets for retirement and applies those concepts in a new way. The following six steps provide a systematic method of producing a tailored plan to manage retirement income and risks. They are also applicable when working with higher-net-worth clients who want to spend more than they should: 1. Estimate duration of retirement assets. 2. Identify and manage retirement risks. 3. Identify distribution, tax, and estate issues and opportunities. 5. Identify options for addressing gaps. 5. Convert resources into income. 6. Maintain and update the plan.","Seibert, Kevin S, CFP, CRC, CEBS;Meredith, Betty, CFA, CFP, CRC", Feature,Aug,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Guidelines , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Risk management , Retirement planning , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Creating Grantor Trusts,"Several estate planning techniques rely on the use of grantor trusts. The grantor trust rules are found in IRC §§ 671-677 and are a congressional response to a long history of taxpayer attempts to split taxable income with or to shift taxable income to trusts while retaining either the right to the income or the power to control beneficial enjoyment. The grantor trust rules apply if certain powers are retained by the grantor or held by the grantor's spouse and third parties. One of the most difficult issues in many estate plans is selecting the specific mechanism that will result in an irrevocable trust being classified as a grantor trust for income tax purposes without creating adverse estate tax consequences. With various options available, you should almost always be able to find a technique that creates grantor trust status without adverse estate tax consequences.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Feature,Aug,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Tax planning , Grantor trusts , Taxable income , Estate taxes , Income taxes , Internal Revenue Code , Trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Communicating with Clients Touched by Death,"You can be the best financial wizard in the US, but if your clients do not feel they get sufficient or appropriate communications from you, they will go elsewhere. Financial advisers therefore put a great deal of time and energy into ensuring their client communication practices are top-notch. When death touches a client, these careful schemas of communication no longer apply, and many advisers enter uncharted territory as they attempt to sincerely convey concern and sympathy in the context of a professional relationship. The author offers the following guidelines, formed through her education in bereavement, facilitation of a support group for over 20 years, personal experience of being widowed, and the collective wisdom of hundreds of grieving people: 1.

Joe Hurley on the Future of 529 Plans and Saving for College,"In an interview, Joe Hurley, founder, SavingForCollege.com, and VP at Bankrate.com, talked about the future of 529 plans and saving for college. According to Hurley, he believes states should eliminate income tax deductions for 529 plans. The tax advantages were compelling: the need was out there for a way for families to try to save money for college and not have to pay income taxes on the earnings that should actually be going to pay tuition bills. Hurley thinks the future is fairly bleak simply because prepaid tuition plans are facing conditions of high tuition increases and inadequate investment returns, which are causing them to suffer severe financial distress. This is occurring to such an extent that many prepaid plans have been shut down to new enrollment simply because they cannot afford to bring more families into those plans. Still, prepaid plans aren't necessarily dead.","Buttell, Amy E", Interview,Aug,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Education finance , Financial planning , Qualified tuition programs , Executives , Savings plans , Tuition , Prepaid services , United States--US , Hurley, Joe",ProQuest One Academic

Return Measures and Dollar Cost Averaging,"Financial planners are routinely asked to make future value of annuity calculations regarding an investor's target wealth based on assumptions about the annual rate of return and an annual contribution amount. Planners, however, need to carefully examine the assumptions behind their computations. The importance of return sequence for dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investors is supported in the literature. This paper proceeds as follows: First the authors examine realized returns from the period 1990-2009 from the perspective of both lump sum investors and investors who are making annual contributions to illustrate the difference in outcomes for the realized annual returns on contributions depending on the order of returns. Then perform Monte Carlo simulations using parameter estimates from 1990-2009 to gauge the probability for an outcome of more than a 300 basis point difference between the realized geometric mean and the realized effective annual return on contributions. Finally, they highlight some key findings and the implications for individual investors and their advisers.","Chittenden, William T, PhD;Moon, Kenneth P, PhD;Toles, J Holland, PhD, CFA", Feature,Aug,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Monte Carlo simulation , Measurement techniques , Lump sum , Averaging income , Lump sum distributions , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

What I've Come to Believe About Retirement Planning,"Twenty-five years ago, most of the author's retirement planning was pretty much a theoretical exercise. His firm had few if any, retired clients. He was building the firm with folks who were age 40, plus or minus 15 years. This article presents five of his beliefs about retirement planning: 1. In the real world, there's no such thing as a straight line or a smooth curve. 2. There's no such thing as a safe investment. 3. Human beings have little capacity to predict their spending patterns five years from now, let alone 40 years from now. 4. Human beings aren't wired to conceptualize large sums of capital. 5. The answer doesn't (and will never) rely on one simple solution or product. He has come to believe that he can't actually change client behavior; he can only show them the results of their current course of action in a clear, accurate manner.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU", Feature,Jul,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Perceptions , Consumer behavior , Client relationships , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Psychology of Retirement Planning,"While there has been a recent awakening to the psychological dimensions of money and investing -- often referred to as behavioral finance or behavioral economics -- there has been precious little work that connects these dimensions specifically to retirement planning. Now, in the wake of the worst financial downturn since the Great Depression, millions of boomers are on the threshold of their golden years and are deeply in need of revisiting their notion of retirement. As a result, financial planners are increasingly called upon to act as counselors -- or even part-time psychologists. The good news is you need not possess an in-depth knowledge of investor psychology to understand how your clients think about money. The most important thing is to be cognizant of the emotions that play into their financial decisions and use these considerations to guide the financial planning process. Taking all factors into account -- in other words, taking a truly holistic approach to financial planning -- is essential to helping your clients achieve their retirement goals.","Salsbury, Gregory, PhD", Feature,Jul,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Baby boomers , Behavior , Financial planners , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Opportunities in Retirement Plans for Small-Business Owners,"Small-business owners typically are too busy building their enterprises or, in today's challenging environment, keeping them afloat, to stay abreast of opportunities in retirement plan design and investments. Indeed, many are often unaware of their basic legal obligations as retirement plan sponsors and de facto fiduciaries, such as having a formal investment policy in writing. While many planners have been chipping away for years at accumulating small-business retirement plan assets to manage, the opportunities to make headway today may be better than in the recent past. For one, business owners who have long banked on selling their businesses to generate retirement capital are beginning to on the scheduled jump in individual federal income and capital gains tax rates next year resulting from the end of the Bush tax cuts.

"Strategic Option Protection Increases Return, Decreases Risk","Financial planners seeking to maximize returns can't avoid equities, but they can purchase insurance to protect against downturns in client portfolios. This paper deduces the cost at which such insurance -- put options -- is viable, and when it is likely to backfire on the client and planner. Of the various put options available to protect against a wide market decline, those on CBOE exchange-traded funds covering a broad number of stocks are the most appropriate hedging tool. Previous studies have looked at a strategy of continuously buying puts to protect a portfolio. While this is a fail-safe method, the costs of the hedging would so eat into returns as to make the strategy a less-than-optimum deployment of funds. A cost limit must be involved. For the S&amp;P 500, the best strategy was to select the put option with the lowest annualized cost but with a limit of 4%.","Burke, John B, CFP;Xu, Wei", Feature,Jul,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Studies , Hedging , Investment policy , Exchange traded funds , Put & call options , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Treasury Bills and Inflation,"The objective of this paper is to examine the historical performance of Treasury bills relative to bonds and stocks under different inflationary conditions. Over the period studied, Treasury bill yields were positively correlated with inflation and on average provided nominal returns before taxes above the inflation rate. However, on an estimated after-tax basis, the real returns became negative and thus did not preserve an investor's capital. Furthermore, the long-term average real return on Treasury bills was lower than the average real return on bonds and stocks, especially on an estimated after-tax basis. Thus, stocks and bonds provided better long-run protection against inflation. However, Treasury bills performed better than bonds and stocks in years when inflation was very high. Historical experience suggests that over the long run Treasury bills are not a good hedge against inflation. However, because stocks and bonds are more adversely affected by high inflation levels and/or large increases in inflation, Treasury bills could temporarily serve as a refuge.","Trevino, Ruben C, PhD;Yates, Barbara M, PhD", Feature,Jul,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Correlation analysis , Long term , Stocks , Inflation , Treasury bills , Tax basis , Yield , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Roth IRA Conversions: Estate and Tax Planning Information,"This article presents an overview of the features of the Roth IRA, including exploring guidelines for determining whether conversion from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs makes the most sense. One guideline suggests that the longer the interval before eventual distribution, the greater the expected benefit of conversion from traditional to Roth IRAs. Another guideline suggests that increased return assumptions tend to favor conversion to Roth IRAs. The article then looks to the conversion opportunity specific to 2010, and explores recharacterization and re-conversion, as well as partial recharacterizations. In the case of full re-conversions of the Roth IRA balance in an account, no gain/loss calculation is needed; however, partial re-conversions must take into account the net income attributable, the gain or loss experienced while it was in the Roth IRA. Because Roth IRA owners and surviving spouses are not required to take required minimum distributions, Roth conversion can present a unique estate planning opportunity.","Gordon, David J, CFP, CIMA", Feature,Jul,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Conversion , Roth IRAs , Tax planning , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Finding Investment Opportunities in Today's Credit and Real Estate Markets,"In today's disturbed economic environment, two areas where advisers may find opportunities to add value to their clients' portfolios are in the credit and real estate markets. Clearly, traditional banks and mortgage lenders are under pressure from increasing capital requirements, troubled loan portfolios, TARP restrictions, and a general risk-averse attitude, making it extremely difficult for them to extend credit, even to highly qualified borrowers. This gap between the supply of mortgage loans and demand creates an excellent opportunity for an alternative solution to traditional lending. Known as ""private mortgage lending,"" this category of mortgage financing offers high returns to investors who make loans directly to borrowers secured by individual or pooled deeds of trust. Once a loan is funded, a private mortgage lender services the loan and manages the borrower relationship and payment schedule. From a financial planning point of view, pooled trust deed investments in particular provide an alternative, fixed income solution to enhance returns and help diversify fixed income portfolios.","Welsh, Timothy D, CFP", Feature,Jun,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Alternatives , Mortgages , Investment advisors , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Social Security Reset: When Does It Make Sense?,"More than 50% of initial Social Security retirement beneficiaries claim reduced early benefits. The decision to claim reduced Social Security retirement benefits before full retirement age (FRA) is not irrevocable. Prior research into the structure of Social Security retirement benefits has identified optimal claiming ages for married couples with dissimilar ages and differing Primary Insurance Amounts (PIA). A benefit less than or greater than the PIA is paid if claimed at less than or greater than at full retirement age (FRA). The benefit is reduced by 6.67% per year for each of the first three years prior to FRA, and reduced another 5% for each additional year. Because reductions or increases to retirement benefits are actuarially equivalent for the person with average life expectancy, an unmarried retiree should be indifferent to when he or she makes a claim.

Many of these issues, including construction of the income ""paychecks"" to fund lifestyle goals, tax efficiency on both a short- and long-term basis, and assembling integrated healthcare planning solutions to name just three, become more complex. A withdrawal policy statement specifies the goals, policies, and parameters that the client and adviser agree to adopt to guide future decision-making regarding the use of the client's financial capital to help fund their lifestyle during their retirement years. The establishment of a withdrawal policy statement begins with a conversation to refocus your client's values, goals, fears, and expectations about his or her upcoming retirement. According to Buie and Yeke, well-crafted financial planning policies can serve both planners and their clients by acting as a powerful touchstone in the midst of a rapidly changing world.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP", Feature,Jun,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Retirement , Financial planners , Decision making , Client relationships , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How New and Expected Tax Increases Will Affect Your Clients,"Few things affect earnings more than taxes. And given that the 2001 tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2010, it's no surprise that many FPA members are reevaluating asset allocations to include anticipated and existing changes to tax law. FPA's 2010 Trends in Investing survey found that 43% of planners are reevaluating their current asset allocation strategy because of anticipated or existing income tax legislation; 42% are doing so because of investment tax legislation, including capital gains, and 24% because of estate tax legislation. Despite the looming deadline, Congress has done little on this subject. This article will examine some of the new tax increases passed in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). It will also look at some tax increases people could expect in the near future.

The Dynamic Implications of Sequence Risk on a Distribution Portfolio,"Sequence risk, or the effect of returns on the probability of success for a distribution portfolio, is a timely issue. The stock market decline in 2008 left many retirees, and their advisers, questioning the long-term sustainability of their distribution portfolio. Unlike past research, which has suggested sequence risk only exists for a certain period, the authors contend that a ""spectrum"" of exposure to sequence risk exists, and that sequence risk is always present, regardless of how long distributions have been occurring. While it is commonly assumed that sequence risk ""goes away,"" sequence risk is actually something that is always present. Although the discussion about sequence risk has been in terms of withdrawal rate research, the purpose of this paper is to shift more attention to the use of probability of failure as a dynamic tool to continually evaluate ongoing exposure to adverse market sequences (risk) as a retiree ages through his or her distribution years.","Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP;Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,Jun,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk , Probability , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The New Healthcare Act Includes Tax Breaks and Additional Taxes,"In March, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), the historic healthcare bill Pres Obama has been advocating since his election. Although the legislation mandates universal healthcare insurance, it will probably also be remembered for the additional taxes it creates. The main purpose of PPACA is to mandate universal health coverage by requiring individuals, not businesses, to obtain health-care coverage or pay penalties. Exemptions from the penalty are granted for financial hardship, religious objections, American Indians, those without coverage for fewer than three months, aliens not lawfully present in the US, incarcerated individuals, those for whom the lowest cost plan option exceeds 8% of household income, those with incomes below the tax filing threshold, and those residing outside of the US. The PPACA has been controversial to say the least.

Advisers and Compliance Officers Struggle to Find Common Ground,"While many advisers, either dually registered as RIA and FINRA-registered rep or simply FINRA-registered only, do sing the praises of their broker-dealer's compliance staff, there still seems to be a disconnect between advisers and compliance -- in issues on which they're focused, on things they want to do, and on how to have a happy meeting in the gray areas. If compliance is part of the legal department, conflict can arise from attorneys' natural interest in protecting the firm; compliance, on the other hand, may be focused on a goal of helping advisers improve their practices and procedures. Exploding in use, social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook have captured the attention of advisers, broker-dealers, and regulators. However, Chris Hall, senior multimedia training specialist, Securities America, cautions that while social media does seem to be the newest shiny object, he is loath to encourage advisers to get on the bandwagon ""just because.""","Lee, Shelley A", Cover Story,Jun,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Brokers , Federal regulation , Compliance , Social networks , Professional relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Understanding Inflation: Strategies to Protect Clients' Assets,"The dynamic nature of the market for money can make it difficult for even the best economists and financial analysts to predict future rates of inflation. One way that markets display their expectations of inflation is through interest rates -- particularly through the difference in the yields of Treasury bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). TIPS, however, are structured to increase their principal amount in direct proportion to changes in the Consumer Price Index. Gold has historically been one of the most popular choices for investors seeking to hedge against inflation, and with the increasing availability of exchange-traded funds (ETF), gaining access to the gold market may be easier. ETFs also provide investors access to a wide array of commodity markets. ETFs haven also made it possible to invest in a broad portfolio of real estate investment trusts using a basket approach.","Becker, Joseph", Feature,Jun,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment advisors , Hedging , Inflation , REITs , Commodities trading , Gold markets , Exchange traded funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Emerging Trend of Tactical Asset Allocation,"Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory and Sharpe's Capital Asset Pricing Model are taught to virtually all financial planners, financial analysts, and MBAs as the fundamental methodology for portfolio construction. While these theories have provided important groundwork for the growth of the money management industry, many academics today have recognized that the mathematical and economic assumptions in these models are questionable; they do not clearly meet the test of ""real world"" observations about market or investor behavior. Because investors are presumed to be rational and have perfect economic foresight, and because there is no change believed to occur in the economic system, investors can safely assume that past returns will be repeated in the future. In this world, asset class returns, volatility, and the correlation of returns for all asset classes can be modeled using traditional techniques, and the investment adviser's role is simply to provide a fixed diversified portfolio that lies somewhere along the single fixed efficient frontier.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC;Solow, Kenneth R, CFP, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Jun,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment advisors , Asset allocation , Capital assets , Economic theory , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Advisers Regaining Investing Confidence,"According to FPA's 2010 Trends In Investing survey, advisers seem confident with the investment vehicles they currently use and recommend, namely mutual funds, cash and equivalents, exchange-traded funds (ETF), variable annuities, and REITs -- all of which are being used by most planners, and that level of use has remained relatively unchanged from 2009. The percentage of assets under management (AUM) in ETFs remained pretty steady from 2008 to 2010, with an average of 14% of AUM held in ETFs in 2010, compared to 12% in 2009 and 16% in 2008. With three quarters of advisers already using ETF and 32% of those not using them planning to do so in the next 12 months, many advisers are wondering what's next in product development and innovation.

"Harry M. Markowitz on Modern Portfolio Theory, the Efficient Frontier, and His Life's Work","In an interview, Harry M. Markowitz, winner of the Nobel Prize, talked about modern portfolio theory, the financial crisis, and the influence of his theories on investing. One of the things that an adviser should do is to help clients understand volatility. There is more volatility for portfolios high on the frontier and less volatility for portfolios low on the frontier. On average, you should spend a little less than what you make. So, you know, just because a portfolio did poorly in 2008, as long as that was in line with its estimated volatility, then, that was perfectly acceptable performance for that portfolio. There are a couple of things that are new since the theory came out. In the first place, the notion of doing a top-down analysis, first in terms of asset classes and parceling this out, that made portfolio theory, that enabled lots of financial analysts, financial advisers, able to do a good job for their clients.","Buttell, Amy E", Interview,May,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment advisors , Economic crisis , Volatility , Portfolio management , United States--US , Markowitz, Harry",ProQuest One Academic

"Creating Safe, Aggressive Retirement Income Profiles","Past research on retirement income has concentrated on defining real income profiles that are flat or increasing over time. This paper defines safe profiles in which real income decreases with age, called aggressive profiles. Two types of aggressive profiles are defined, smooth and step. In smooth profiles, real retirement income decreases a constant amount each year. Step profiles maintain a constant real income level for five-year periods before decreasing. Monte Carlo simulations are used to test 30-year profiles and identify those that have 99%, 95%, and 90% success rates. Three common-sense rules based on previous research are used to adjust a retiree's annual real income each year in retirement in response to economic conditions. The Negative Return and Capital Preservation Rules can help rescue troubled portfolios by dictating cuts in withdrawals when conditions warrant. Either rule can be combined with the Prosperity Rule, which increases income in good economic times.","Klinger, William J", Feature,May,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Monte Carlo simulation , Retirement planning , Real income , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Finding Alternative Investments that Make Sense for Your Clients,"In the wake of the market turmoil in recent years, the ever-creative financial products industry has been churning out new vehicles to lure skittish investors back into the market, or simply to persuade them to shift from tried and true investments to something new and different. In general, their efforts have been rewarded. Since 2006, for example, the universe of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has grown 143% in number and 36% in assets over the same period. Similarly, investment management companies have been energetically tapping the traditional mutual fund legal structure as a repository for ""alternative"" assets and investment strategies. Still, it's no easy matter to reallocate assets into a new and somewhat unfamiliar realm -- for a good reason: some alternatives and ETFs that appear to be ""plain vanilla"" in nature may actually turn out to be lemons.

Diversification Effect: Isolating the Effect of Correlation on Portfolio Risk,"Diversification effect (DE) is a reduction in portfolio risk created by imperfect correlations between asset return pairs. DE is important because correlations are independent of rate of return. Thus, portfolio risk can be reduced without compromising rate of return. Correlation coefficients are frequently used to measure DE in practical applications of portfolio management. All asset return pairs possess correlation, allocation, and risk properties. Therefore, correlation, as a measure of DE, can be confounded by allocation and risk. This article proposes a DE metric that isolates the effect of correlation coefficients on portfolio risk by controlling the effects of allocation and the risk imposed by individual asset returns. By precisely measuring DE, financial planners can manage it in the context of other important portfolio properties and investors' multiple competing objectives. The content of this article is technically complex and intended only for use by experienced financial planners who commit significant resources to constructing and maintaining investment portfolios.","Hight, Gregory N", Feature,May,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Correlation analysis , Risk , Rates of return , Portfolio management , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Games Rich People Play,"The unthinkable has happened, Congress let the temporary estate tax repeal survive to its sunset year. When the Economic Growth and Tax Relief and Reconciliation Act of 2001 was passed, leading to a one-year repeal of the estate tax in 2010 followed by a rebirth of the tax in its full former glory in 2011, nobody believed that there really would be a repeal of the tax in 2010. The consensus was that the repeal and sunset were budget gimmicks and that Congress would take action to avoid this result before the end of 2009. If Congress does repeal the estate tax outright, it is true that life insurance will no longer be needed to fund the payment of estate taxes. The use of life insurance in transfer planning remains alive and well even in an estate tax repeal environment.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA", Commentary,May,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Affluence , Bills , Life insurance , Estate taxes , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Varying Cost of Options and Implications for Choosing the Right Strategy,"Put buying reduces risk, but is expensive and dramatically depresses returns. It is only worthwhile if timed for extreme downturns, or when combined with call selling into collars. Collars offer the best of both worlds: a significant risk reduction without a significant return erosion. Call selling alone leads to superior terminal wealth, but has no positive effect on risk. Thus, in the buy-vs.-sell debate, the real questions are not whether to, but what to buy or sell, when, and why (from the retirement saver's perspective). The authors study the cost of using index options to protect equity portfolios. To estimate the cost, they combine the VIX index (which determines the at-the-money implied volatility) with the volatility skew and bid-ask spreads (because protective strategies involve buying and selling various strike levels). Because the cost of options varies dramatically over time and is weakly (negatively) correlated with the market, investors have to be wise in how they overlay option protection on investment portfolios.","Dubil, Robert, PhD", Feature,May,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Buy sell agreements , Studies , Costs , Investment policy , Put & call options , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Key points also apply to other investment company prospectuses, such as those for closed-end funds and unit investment trusts. The article provides examples of prospectuses and related documents required by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some key points to consider in evaluating a prospectus are the fund's investment objectives, risks, fees, management, legal proceedings, and redemption restrictions.

Widowed Before Retirement: Social Security Benefit Claiming Strategies,"Financial planners should be aware of Social Security program rules unique to widows approaching retirement. This paper examines these rules and their implications for benefit claiming strategies, complementing recent studies on Social Security claiming decisions. Using present value analysis, the researchers examine the effects of claiming benefits at different ages. Results vary depending on whether a widow is only eligible for a survivor benefit from Social Security or eligible for a survivor benefit and a retirement benefit. When a widow is only eligible for a survivor benefit based on her deceased husband's work record, the researchers find the present value of lifetime benefits is only modestly affected by the age at which benefits are claimed. In dually eligible cases, benefit claiming strategies can be important. Which benefit should be claimed first in dually eligible cases depends on the ratio of the two basic benefit amounts.","Shuart, Amy N;Weaver, David A, PhD;Whitman, Kevin", Feature,Apr,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Widows & widowers , Claims processing , Social security , Present value , Retirement benefits , Death benefits , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The author suspects that many of the planners are not very forgiving of themselves. Maybe they expanded too quickly because they assumed growth was inevitable. Maybe they were forced to lay off some terrific employees because profits evaporated. Maybe they lost some long-term clients because they felt betrayed. There are clearly residual effects of the Great Recession. But it is important for all of you to move on. You have the capacity to do great good in your work.

Controlling Investment Discretion in Irrevocable Trusts,"Trustees of irrevocable trusts have both distributive and investment functions. This column raises several issues related to the trustee's investment function that are likely to be near to the heart of the financial adviser and that should be raised with the client and his or her attorney when an irrevocable trust is being drafted. Unless otherwise restricted in the trust instrument, a trustee has broad investment discretion under the estate and trust laws of most states, especially those that have adopted the Uniform Prudent Investor Act. Without further planning, the trustee will be vested with sole investment discretion. While this is undoubtedly appropriate in many instances, there are other instances in which the settler may not be satisfied with this result or the beneficiaries might not be best served by this result. Consideration should be given to the use of a trust protector with authority to change the manner in which investment discretion is exercised.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Feature,Apr,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Irrevocable trusts , Trustees , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Betting the Farm: Estate Planning for Middle-Income Clients,"When the average person, perhaps even some planners, thinks of the estate tax, they probably think of the scenario of Karen Davidson and the Detroit Pistons of the NBA. Many in the estate planning world are dismayed that Congress -- healthcare and other distractions notwithstanding -- let the clock wind down on 2009 without enacting some legislation to address the expiring estate tax. A failure to act this year means the estate tax will return in 2011 to levels seen early in the decade -- an exemption of only $1 million, as opposed to the current $3.5 million, with the remainder being taxed at 55%. The classic definition of estate planning includes three goals outside addressing the estate tax: plan for incapacity, distribute your assets when and to whom, and provide for minor children or those with special needs. Absent any action from Congress this year, estate planning for most people should focus on the basics, especially the documents.","Lee, Shelley A", Cover Story,Apr,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Fiscal policy , Estate taxes , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Money on Your Mind: The Brain's Role in Financial Decision-Making,"The sophistication of modern civilization masks the fact that the brains have evolved little since the Stone Age. The neural programming of human beings was optimized for physical survival, not contemporary challenges such as financial decision-making. The human brain has separate, dedicated centers for coping with situations that present imminent danger or attractive rewards. When triggered by highly stimulating personal or financial events, these centers can cause the brain to react reflexively, dampening the ability to think analytically. Technology gives people ready access to their credit, savings, and investment accounts. Unfortunately, this access makes it easier for people to act upon impulsive financial decisions. This paper examines a case study to demonstrate how perceived financial dangers or rewards can unconsciously trigger emotions that override their rational decision-making. Financial planners also can help their clients develop new methods to read to financial situations in a more analytical manner that is consistent with the clients primary values.","Lennick, Doug, CFP", Feature,Apr,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Brain , Financial planning , Decision making , Personal finance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Guiding Clients Through the Transition to Medicare,"Once a fairly straightforward process, transitioning clients to Medicare from employer-based or individual insurance coverage has become a process fraught with costly pitfalls, where sheer ignorance or a simple mistake can carry financial and medical consequences throughout the retirement years. Depending on the state of your clients' health and what happens with healthcare reform and healthcare inflation, their overall tab in retirement for out-of-pocket expenses, including Medicare premiums, deductibles, and co-pays on prescriptions, as well as costs that aren't covered by Medicare, is likely to be a minimum of $100,000 and could easily hit $300,000. This excludes costs and premiums associated with long-term care. Another Medicare-related issue relevant to planning is the ages of a married couple, because one person usually is eligible for Medicare before the other, which can present a problem if the non-Medicare eligible spouse doesn't have employer-based coverage or other affordable coverage.","Buttell, Amy E", Cover Story,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Transitions , Health care expenditures , Retirement planning , Medicare , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Life Insurance Solutions for Estate Tax Challenges,"Although the estate tax is in hibernation for the year, it will awaken in 2011. Large estates with difficult to market assets face a potential estate tax liquidity problem. Life insurance is ideal for this situation. A few years ago, many life insurance companies developed and began selling universal life policies with no-lapse secondary guarantees based on paying specified premiums. Static pricing is in stark contrast to market pricing. A market priced policy's performance (and premiums) will depend on future fixed-income yields and mortality experience. Static-priced policies have low to no cash values, whereas market-priced policies have robust cash values. Static-priced policies have little to zero cash values.

"The Rules of Engagement, Part 2","This article focuses on the additional obligations on CFP certificants who clearly practice financial planning in their engagements, or those deemed to be doing so. In determining whether the certificant is providing financial planning or material elements of financial planning, factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: 1. the client's understanding and intent in engaging the certificant, 2. the degree to which multiple financial planning subject areas are involved, 3. the comprehensiveness of data gathering, and 4. the breadth and depth of recommendations. Financial planning may occur even if the material elements are not provided to a client simultaneously, are delivered over a period of time, or are delivered as distinct subject areas. It is not necessary to provide a written financial plan to engage in financial planning. One of the ideas circulating in Washington, DC, today is that anyone who gives financial advice to the public will be held to a fiduciary standard.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU", Feature,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Series & special reports , Financial planners , Financial planning , Client relationships , Fiduciary responsibility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Asset Allocation for Retirement: Simple Heuristics and Target-Date Funds,"The authors examine common asset allocation strategies for retirement investing, considering both static and dynamic approaches, as well as those allocation policies used by leading target-date fund providers. They studied the average performance of each strategy over historical rolling periods, using actual annual returns starting in 1926. Then they applied the simulation method to review potential future results, as well as to provide additional insight into the structure and characteristics of each approach. They find that, over time, certain static approaches are essentially equivalent to dynamic strategies that reduce equity exposure through time. They suggest that financial planners consider a 100% equity allocation for their clients until approximately 10 years prior to a client's retirement, at which point a more conservative allocation should be employed. When planning for their clients' retirements, financial planners must pay particular attention to determining target asset allocations and especially to the split between overall equity and debt.","Dolvin, Steven D, PhD, CFA;Templeton, William K, PhD;Rieber, William J, PhD", Feature,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Lifecycle funds , Heuristic , Asset allocation , Retirement planning , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Unsafe at Any Speed? The Designed-In Risks of Target-Date Glide Paths,"Given the poor investment performance that so many defined contribution plan participants experienced by investing in target-date funds (TDF) in 2008 and early 2009, it is not surprising that the US Department of Labor is reviewing their suitability as a ""safe harbor"" qualified default investment alternative. These funds in marketed as simple solutions for plan participants who find it too difficult, unpleasant, or time-consuming to choose among investment alternatives. Lawmakers, regulators, and plan sponsors have expressed concern with TDF safety. The level of investment risk in these funds is primarily a function of their asset allocation glide paths. The term ""glide path"" refers to the schedule for changing the proportion of assets invested in stocks, bonds, or cash over time. Another set of issues has to do with risk measurement. Currently, there is no generally accepted standard for measuring target-date fund risk. This has led to much uncertainty over just how risky they are.","Bodie, Zvi, PhD;Fullmer, Richard K, CFA;Treussard, Jonathan, PhD", Feature,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Lifecycle funds , Defined contribution plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS: What Do Financial Planning Services Consumers Look Like Now?,"One result of the economic downturn is that many financial planners are looking for ways to optimize their client base, either by adding new clients or marketing additional services to their existing ones. FPA recently commissioned a survey of consumers and potential consumers of financial planning services. As expected, the percentage of those who receive financial planning services increases with the respondent's age. Of all respondents age 65 or older, 32.4% receive services, compared to only 6.2% of the 18-24-year-olds surveyed. Predictably, respondents with higher annual incomes were more likely to already be working with a financial planner. Twenty-eight percent of people in the $100,001-$150,000 bracket work with a financial planner, as do 29% of those in the $150,001-$200,000 bracket and 60.9% in the $200,001-and-up bracket.

"Mary Anne Ehlert on the Myths, Challenges, and Role of Advisers in Special-Needs Planning","In an interview, Mary Anne Ehlert, founder and president, Protected Tomorrows and Ehlert Financial Group, talked about the challenges and role of advisers in special-needs planning. As she began working with special-needs families, she found that most of them had not done planning, or had done improper estate planning and didn't understand why they were doing it. Confusion is the biggest challenge families and their advisers face in special-needs planning -- and that they don't know what they don't know. Just getting proper advice is another challenge. They formed Protected Tomorrows in 2003. What they do is comprehensive planning or holistic planning, focusing on the person with special needs and fitting that into the family's financial plan. They found that there were so many special-needs families that they couldn't serve them all. So they started their advocacy program called Protected Tomorrows Advocates. Unless a planner is really driven, it's a tough step to take -- like any adviser who wants to add a social work component to their practice.","Most, Bruce", Interview,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Exceptional children , Financial planners , Roles , Planning , United States--US , Ehlert, Mary Anne",ProQuest One Academic

MARKETING TO CONSUMERS: Attracting Your Ideal Client by Focusing on Topics of Interest,"One important piece of your marketing strategy is your brand. As a planner, you want prospective clients to consider you to be trustworthy and knowledgeable. That image will help convert a prospect into a client. To attract and impress the clientele you are seeking, one key way is to position yourself as an expert in areas of interest. Whether you are submitting a column or letter in your local paper, writing a newsletter, or creating your marketing brochure, carefully consider which specific planning topics you cover. If you want to attract as many individuals as possible, focus on the general consumer section of this article. If you wish to target a specific client type by asset level, focus on the consumers by investable assets.

APPLIED PLANNING: Healthcare Strategies in Retirement Income Planning,"While overall retirement income strategies affect the entirety of the retirement income plan and are very important as a result, healthcare strategies also warrant special attention. This article reveals findings from FPA's 2009 Advisers' Attitudes and Perceptions About the Retirement Income Distribution Market study, conducted by The Diversified Services Group and sponsored by Nationwide Financial Institute of Retirement Income. The methods of healthcare management used by the adviser have no affect on the likelihood of clients having to delay their retirement, become re-employed, or make a significant lifestyle adjustment related to economic conditions. Advisers who do employ any of the methods of healthcare management specified in the study are just as likely to have clients experience those situations as advisers who do not employ that same method. Healthcare expenses/long-term care issues was one of the items advisers ranked. Overall, 42.9% of advisers say this issue is very or extremely likely to have influenced the client's decision.","King, Rebecca", Feature,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Health care management , Financial planners , Income distribution , Market research , Retirement planning , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Staying Relevant,"One of the most significant changes in the financial planning profession over the last 30 years is the commoditization of so much of it. Commoditization takes place when there is a dilution of the differentiation and competitive advantages in favor of a mass market, with pricing determining behavior. In the early days of financial planning, a significant part of the value was related to the ability to crunch numbers and do projections. The more planners attempt to mechanize and institutionalize the qualitative part of a client relationship, the less relevant their services will become. Technological advances, because of their potential for dehumanization, must always be subordinate to a successful personalized client relationship, especially relating to qualitative issues. So while it is critical to differentiate yourself based on non-quantitative issues, the focus on ""wisdom and experience"" type issues magnifies the potential of obtaining new clients.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP", Feature,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Social Security: When to Start Benefits and How to Minimize Longevity Risk,"This study examines strategies for singles and couples who are deciding when to begin Social Security benefits. Two factors should affect individuals' decisions about when to begin Social Security benefits. For single taxpayers with average life expectancies who will not be subject to an earnings test, present value of benefits is approximately the same no matter when benefits begin. Therefore, based on present value criterion, singles with short life expectancies should begin benefits early and those with longer life expectancies should delay. Finally this study discusses the do-over option, whereby someone can repay prior benefits and start benefits anew. Singles can start benefits at age 62 regardless of their health and reassess their health at age 70. Couples can also benefit from the do-over but there is a risk of the higher-earning partner starting benefits earlier with the plan to invest the Social Security benefits, keep the interest and repay them at a later date.","Meyer, William;Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA", Feature,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Old age benefits , Social security , Present value , Life expectancy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Improving the Adviser-Client Relationship, Part 2","Successful investment advisers need to be world class at both investing and getting their clients to act upon the investment advice that is dispensed. In December the authors discussed some insights of behavioral finance that pertain to establishing the adviser-client relationship and profiling the client. They describe some key findings from behavioral finance that pertain to making recommendations to clients and make suggestions for advisers about how to incorporate these findings into their practice. Many advisers make a mistake at this phase of the relationship because they approach it as purely a technical problem of making the best recommendations possible. Achieving that goal requires that the recommendations be expert, but also take into account the likelihood of being enacted. These recommendations include: 1. Obtain client buy-in. 2. Understand the client's past investment experiences. 3. Understand the ownership history of the client's existing investments. 4. Do not assume the clients' versions of their history are accurate.","Olson, Bryan, CFA;Riepe, Mark W, CFA", Feature,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Series & special reports , Investment advisors , Client relationships , Behavioral economics , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

This article will show ways you can leverage your existing, or future, customer relationship management (CRM) software to increase your revenues, your client capacity, and client satisfaction through more effective service. From a statistical standpoint, there is not a defined association between the cost of the CRM software and the benefits of more effective client service, increased revenue, or the ability to serve more clients. While cost is not statistically associated with these benefits, the use of specific functions does show a relationship between specific functions and these benefits. Those who use CRM to handle campaign management and prospect generation are more likely to agree that their CRM has increased their practice's revenue. This study shows that there is an association between using the CRM function and finding that the CRM software enables better client service.","King, Rebecca", Feature,Mar,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Customer relationship management , Customer satisfaction , Revenue , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

SHIELDING AGAINST COLLEGE INVESTMENT HAZARDS and Bridging the Affordability Gap,"Volatile investment markets and legal constraints on the ability to actively manage Section 529 college saving plan portfolios have challenged some planners' efforts to guide clients down a smooth higher education funding path. Prior to last year, 529 plan investment election switches could only be made once a year-assuming one didn't go through the cumbersome exercise of rolling 529 funds into different new accounts with different investment choices. For 2009, that annual switching limit was doubled -- a change that may be made permanent. James Holtzman, CFP, CPA, of Legend Financial Advisors in Pittsborgh, says he often encourages clients to use a ""multi-account"" approach and not put all college savings in the 529 basket. Holtzman encourages some of his Pennsylvania resident clients to diversify their market risk by taking partial advantage of the states pre-paid tuition plan. In theory, pre-paid plans provide an investment return equal to the rate of college tuition inflation.","Stolz, Richard F", Cover Story,Feb,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Higher education , Tax benefits , Portfolio management , Tuition , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

So, when considering a new product for possible client implementation, the author always begin by reminding himself of what he likes to call Wagner's Third Law of Financial Planning: Don't do anything stupid. Financial planners can employ a combination of policies and products to navigate the obvious conflicts, contradictions and trade-offs contained in some ideals.

A Simple Dynamic Strategy for Portfolios Taking Withdrawals: The Case for Using a 12-Month Simple Moving Average,"This paper examines the long-term effects of using a dynamic investment strategy based on a 12-month simple moving average for portfolios in both the accumulation and withdrawal phases. It compares the results of this dynamic strategy to standard static portfolio allocations based on Modern Portfolio Theory to determine whether such a strategy is optimal. The authors created six portfolios using historical data (1926-2008) from two asset classes: US large-cap equities and US intermediate-term government bonds. The six portfolios were examined for 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, and 7% withdrawal rates over 30- and 40-year annual rolling periods from 1927-2008. As the investing period increased, the dynamic portfolio tended to outperform the 100% equity portfolio. This paper concludes that a dynamic asset allocation using a 12-month simple moving average is a consistently better strategy over statically allocated portfolios for investors in both the accumulation and withdrawal phases.","Garrison, Michael M, CFP;Sera, Carlos M;Cribbs, Jeffrey G, CFP", Feature,Feb,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Stocks , Bonds , Asset allocation , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Promote open discussion and honesty about financial matters between the parents and their teens. 3. Allow the teen to feel respected as a maturing individual and involved in a process that will have profound implications for him or her. 4.

Keeping the Vacation Home in the Family-Another Use for Limited Liability Companies,"While purchases of primary residences are declining, purchases of second homes are taking off as buyers take advantage of the soft real estate market. Housing statistics indicate 1 in 10 homes in the US is a seasonal or vacation home that serves as a regular family vacation destination. Because of the need for an easily transferable form of ownership and an operating agreement delineating the use of the property, limited liability companies (LLC) are emerging as one of the preferred ownership vehicles for vacation homes. Ideally the LLC is set up by the original owners with input from the family on the terms of the operating agreement. Alternatively, the vacation home can be transferred to a qualified personal residence trust, with the original owner(s) taking a gift tax discount for retained use of the vacation home. The responsibility for transferring the property and setting up the LLC would then fall on the beneficiaries when the trust terminates.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD", Feature,Feb,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk , Vacation homes , Property management , Limited liability companies , Risk management , Property transfers , Vacations , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

A hypothetical initial client meeting illustrates the use of the Happiness Risk/Reward Pyramid. Further applications of the pyramid include clarifying the relationship between risk and reward, building a financial planning partnership, managing emotions for client and planner, working with clients' money beliefs, dealing with client discomfort, and facilitating communication. The Happiness Risk/Reward Pyramid can serve as a valuable tool to support and sustain the bonds of trust that form the partnership between financial planners and their clients.","Van Zutphen, Neal, CFP", Feature,Jan,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Success , Trust , Studies , Client relationships , Happiness , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Lessons from the Fallen,"The storm from the Great Recession is easing and many tough lessons have already been indelibly etched into those who run a financial planning business. Jim Collins's latest book, How the Mighty Fall, would have been a great roadmap for the leaders of many now-defunct companies on what minefields to avoid and how to turn a company around when it is in a freefall. Collins's research has determined five stages that businesses go though on their way to oblivion. They are: 1. Hubris born of success, 2. undisciplined pursuit of more, 3. denial of risk and peril, 4. grasping for salvation, and 5. capitulation to irreverence or death.","Stearns, Dennis, CFP, ChFC", Feature,Jan,2010,Journal of Financial Planning," Success factors , Financial planners , Recessions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Long-Term Approaches to Managing Retirement Healthcare Costs,"Retirement healthcare costs are a long-term financial liability. Financial planners can serve as an important resource in helping their retired clients manage these costs wisely. Typically, individuals incur almost two-thirds of their retirement healthcare costs during the last half of their retirement. In early retirement, many healthy people seek to reduce costs by enrolling in certain types of lower-premium coverage. In later retirement as they may need more medical services, some retirees plan to switch to more comprehensive coverage. Financial planners can help retired clients assess their various coverage options by using a process that includes estimating the price of excellent insurance, and identifying the client's selection criteria, including good catastrophic protection. At the end of the evaluation process, clients will know that the coverage that they select meets their selection criteria and will understand the tradeoffs when selecting among the options under consideration.","Armes, David, CFP", Feature,Dec,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Health care expenditures , Insurance coverage , Retirement planning , Health insurance , Financial planners , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
PRACTICE TRENDS: Client Segmentation: What Planners Are (and Are Not) Doing,"In general, about 70% of advisers are segmenting their clients and are using a variety of both subjective and objective methods. From a business perspective, client segmentation is focused on finding ways to improve your bottom line by either helping you identify and therefore prospect individuals who are like your best clients or by pointing out areas where you are expending too many or too few resources for what the client relationship warrants. There are a variety of objective metrics that can be applied to client segmentation processes. The most popular methods include the amount of assets the client has given to the practice to manage, the length of the client relationship, and the amount of revenue the client relationship generates for the practice. While nearly 70% of advisers report using at least one client segmentation method, only 31.5% report actually forming their clients into assigned segments or groups.","King, Rebecca", Feature,Dec,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Research , Financial planners , Client relationships , Market segmentation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Use and Misuse of Ascertainable Standards in Trusts,"Contemporary estate plans frequently employ ascertainable standards that limit distributions to beneficiaries to amounts needed for their health, education, support, and maintenance. The use -- or non-use -- of these standards not only affects the nature and amount of distributions to beneficiaries but also has significant gift, estate, and income tax consequences. The theoretical underpinning for the ascertainable standard doctrine is the assumption that the terms health, education, support, and maintenance are sufficiently objective as to render the trustee's authority determinable and enforceable by the courts and to permit the beneficiaries to compel the trustee, through judicial action if necessary, to make or refrain from making distributions. In light of this assumption, this article examines the tax consequences arising from the use of ascertainable standards. It will begin by examining the tax consequences of the rise of ascertainable standards.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Commentary,Dec,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Standards , Trustees , Internal Revenue Code , Estate planning , State court decisions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
APPLIED PLANNING: Retirement Strategies Vary by Client Assets,"Many advisers have differing opinions on the best strategies for handling retirement income distribution. Part of a recent FPA study, conducted by The Diversified Services Group and sponsored by Nationwide Financial Institute of Retirement Income, examined popular strategies, and this article will discuss one aspect of how those strategies performed, as well as some adviser characteristics for each strategy. The strategy employed has no defined relationship to either the years of experience the adviser has in giving advice to retired clients or the number of clients in or near retirement the adviser serves. Advisers were asked to provide the percent of their retired, or nearly retired, clients who delayed their retirement date, plan to become re-employed, needed to significantly re-adjust their lifestyle due to economic needs, or made no significant changes over the last 12 months. Another area in which advisers' chosen retirement income distribution strategies could vary is with the amount of time spent on various activities.","King, Rebecca", Feature,Dec,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Research , Financial planners , Income distribution , Investment policy , Retirement planning , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

When asked which of seven methods of communication they use regularly for contacting clients, the largest number of advisers chose the telephone, at 72.3%. Advisers seemed split on whether a common reason for communicating with clients was to educate them on a particular topic, with about half selecting this reason. What planners decide to include in their communication with clients closely relates to the reasons for contacting them in the first place. Almost 90% of those surveyed agree or strongly agree that they often provide their clients with information to improve their financial literacy.","Nelson, Christina", Feature,Dec,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Polls & surveys , Financial planners , Communication , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Some of the most dramatic differences in media utilization patterns can be seen when comparing rates for business or financial magazines, investment newsletters, and trade publications. Based on these findings, it would appear that in general, people with a higher net worth are more likely to take advantage of all information sources available to them than those with a lower net worth.

Constructing and Defending Core Portfolios in Chaotic Markets,"Financial planners, investment advisers, and their clients are thrown when securities markets make outsized moves. This article will address the assumptions that market movements are best depicted by a normal, Gaussian distribution and that markets are totally random. It will incorporate existing and innovative approaches. Financial planning software, based upon modern portfolio theory or Monte Carlo simulations, tends to group the probabilities of market moves under the Gaussian distribution, that is, bell-shaped curve. This assumption leads to expectations and portfolios that may disappoint the owner: A more suitable portfolio-generating software would accept other distributions as more encompassing of market movements. The generation of portfolios from raw market data and the illustration of random behavior from a deterministic formula point to portfolios as an emergent phenomenon. The pursuit of emergent phenomena leads us to the Santa Fe Institutes mission of discovering the profound simplicity underlying the complexity that surrounds you.","Tomasula, Paul D, Jr, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Dec,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Normal distribution , Studies , Software , Electronic trading systems , Securities markets , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Bonanza or Bust? Roth Conversions in 2010,"It may be a seductive trap for some unwary taxpayers, and simply inappropriate for many of the rest, but the elimination of the income ceiling for Roth retirement account conversion eligibility next year is being hailed as a bonanza for financial planners. And indeed it is. Exuberance aside, there is little doubt that even with ongoing financial media frenzy about Roth conversions during the final run-up to 2010, there is still a large public education job to be done -- and who better to do it than planners. If Roth conversions were an all-or-nothing proposition, they probably would not be prudent under many scenarios, given the uncertainties, planners say. With all of the variables at play in the Roth conversion analysis, financial planning software makers have developed elaborate tools to help with the number crunching. And even if the planner is inclined to believe a Roth conversion doesn't make sense, that doesn't mean the topic should be avoided.","Stolz, Richard F", Cover Story,Dec,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Conversion , Opportunity , Financial planners , Roth IRAs , Roth 401k plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The demand for planning services that helped build your profession is in an explosive new stage. People tend to look for a financial adviser when encountering a life event. They need help managing change and transition. Begin with an ending and end with a beginning, the time in between is the transition from what was to what will be. Transitions begin with an ending, typically a life event that breaks the status quo. Transition clients are different, but the same.

Managing Life Insurance: Loans or Withdrawals?,"Managing life insurance policies on which clients acquire loans is a challenge compared with policies with no indebtedness. The only way to see policy effects clearly is to obtain various illustrations showing future policy values in the presence of loans or cash withdrawals. Whole life policy loans and withdrawals have similar characteristics to universal life. Usually, loans will work better if the policy-owners intend to repay them, but withdrawals work better if the policy-owners do not intend to repay. Cash value (permanent) policies generate cash values that can be used for unexpected bridge borrowing, long-term funding, and to assist with retirement income. Whether money from policies is treated as a loan or withdrawal can produce significant differences in long-term policy values. Which is better depends on how long the money is needed. Short term usually favors taking loans. Long term usually favors using withdrawals.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Feature,Nov,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Variable life insurance , Universal life , Insurance policies , Life insurance , Loans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Results vs. Process: Analyzing the Future Benefit of Common Investment Policy Statement Provisions,"Having a formal investment process is becoming increasingly popular in 401(k) plans. While this process can take a variety of forms, the process is usually codified in what's known as all investment policy statement (IPS). While following a prudent process can provide the plan sponsor with some degree of legal protection, there has been little research into whether common IPS provisions actually lead to better outcomes for the client. The goal of any investment strategy should be to produce a positive outcome for an investor. While following a prudent process clearly has certain legal benefits, the analysis conducted for this paper suggests that common replacement provisions in investment policy statement do not necessarily add value ex-post from an outperformance perspective. This research suggests a simplistic approach to fund monitoring may in fact generate negative value, and that a passive strategy may be more suitable for investment professionals who are unable to quantify the actual benefit of their investment process.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,Nov,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Provisions , Studies , Investment policy , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Nine Steps for Calming Client Fears,"Faced with a fearful client, most advisers present page after page of charts, graphs, and numbers. They create various scenarios for what might reasonably happen, each one leading inexorably to the conclusion that all is well. Because client fear is so pervasive, consider building a fear assessment into your annual review meeting. It is always easier to deal with fears in their infancy than to counteract ""fear monsters"" when they reach epic proportions. The following nine-step procedure is one effective way to conduct a fear assessment: 1. Introduce the topic. 2. Get them talking freely. 3. Take notes as they talk. 4 Allow silence as they think. 5. Read the list back to them so they can clarify any point or add others. 6. Ask them to prioritize. 7. Help them imagine solutions. 8. Create a two-column table. 9.

Similarly clients need time and ongoing positive experiences before they can truly trust the new adviser's judgment and advice. Although you go into review meetings with an established relationship and an understanding of the client's goals and finances, that doesn't make the reviews any less important than initial meetings. From a business perspective, in fact, they may be more important, because established client incur the start-up costs of new relationships. According to the advisers interviewed for this article, the key to successful review sessions is to develop a structure that enhances preparation for client meetings and sets the critical content of those meetings with an agenda.

Potentially Devastating Social Security Offsets,"This study examines the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision within the Social Security system. These two rarely discussed provisions of the law are very important considerations for financial planners because these provisions probably have caused some financial planners' clients to seriously overestimate the Social Security benefit to which they will be entitled. The annual Social Security statement is a good starting point for families to use to estimate future benefits from the Social Security program. However, for those families in which either (or both) spouse(s) has a pension benefit from uncovered employment, the statement may grossly overstate the future benefits to be received. It is the responsibility of financial planners to recognize whether client families will be affected by one or both of these benefit-reducing provisions, and help families develop a financial strategy that accounts for these reductions.","McCormack, Joseph P, PhD, CFA;Perdue, Grady, PhD, CFP", Feature,Nov,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Provisions , Social security , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

One of the concerns he has with financial planning today is that they are focused too much on the financial capital and not enough on the human capital. They focus on people's risk tolerance and time horizon without looking carefully at what their balance sheet really looks like, including human capital. A financial adviser should be segmenting an individual's needs into two groups: absolute must-haves and income above that that would be nice to obtain. So instead of starting with an actual allocation decision on one's entire financial capital, you have to start with a needs analysis and work your way backward from retirement. He is still leveraged in equity. He can't short sell them, other than to leverage into equity.

Purchase a Time-Share Interval or Rent Hotel Rooms?,"Time-share intervals have become quite popular and somewhat controversial over the past few decades. In recent years, people have spoken to several individuals who were looking into the purchase of time-share intervals as an alternative to hotel rentals. A time-share interval can be defined as joint ownership or interest in property (for example, vacation condominium) for exclusive use during an agreed upon period each year. Being able to discuss time-share intervals with clients is quite important, especially when you consider that the typical purchaser is an affluent, well-educated baby boomer -- a demographic that often seeks financial advice.

U.S. Equity Returns After Major Market Crashes,"Research shows that, on average, during periods of business cycle downturns, the expected equity risk premiums increase above the long-term average risk premiums. This paper examines the recovery of the US market after extreme downturns and evaluates whether they follow the historical average results. Additionally, this paper seeks to observe the magnitude of the risk premiums during a recovery as an indication of the possible length of time it took for equities to recover after a market crash. This report analyzes the returns of the four major US equity asset classes during the 12-, 36-, and 60-month periods immediately after each major bear market. The authors' analysis found that risk premiums are above average in periods of extreme bear markets. The authors determined that in the historical periods observed, a well diversified portfolio would fully recover to pre-market crash levels in three to five years, with the main factor being the amount of allocation to small cap stocks.","Leonard, Scott A, CFP, CEA", Feature,Oct,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Small cap investments , Asset allocation , Risk management , Risk premiums , Securities markets , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Fiduciary Bombshell,"Regulators regulate investment products, insurance products, and portfolio management activities. They are not equipped to regulate the financial planning process per se -- at least, not yet. Up to now, a suitability standard has been applied to many investments. For most investors and regulators, everything is fine until an investment goes south. Ultimately, suitability will be judged based on investment outcomes, circumstances largely beyond the adviser's control. Based on the Advice Spectrum study recently conducted by Pershing LLC, investment-centric advisers create stock and bond portfolios and focus on portfolio management. The adviser does not offer planning services. A holistic financial plan is based on deep and often ""right-brained"" and emotional discussions about major life transactions. Broker-dealers, compliance officers, vendors, and professional organizations have a tremendous opportunity to train advisers in relationship-centric life planning. Helping advisers to deliver on the promise of a fiduciary standard is a positive challenge, essential to the future of the profession.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CIMC, CRC", Feature,Oct,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Professional standards , Careers , Client relationships , Bond portfolios , Fiduciary responsibility , Portfolio management , Investments , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

According to Bogle, enough is an important concept about coming to grips with what you really want and need in life and your responsibility to self, family, career, and community. It's particularly important now because the society has lost its bearings a bit. He noted that financial advisors should be doing education, explaining the realities of the marketplace, funds, and life. And yes, they need to say, ""You have enough."" He stressed that there should be an enforceable fiduciary standard for financial advisers. Obviously it's those who are really product salespeople holding themselves out as advisers.

Measuring the Tax Benefit of a Tax-Deferred Annuity,"The authors show how to measure the size of the tax benefit arising from the purchase of fixed annuities relative to holding a taxable account composed of stock and fixed income assets, whether traditional or equity-indexed or for deferred and immediate annuities. The effect of tax deferral can be positive or negative, depending on how these factors interact. Under some circumstances, the benefits from tax deferral can amount to the equivalent of earning more than 200 extra basis points per year relative to the taxable alternative. This tax advantage can be reduced or increased by embedded expense differentials between insurance products and alternative investments, depending upon the products employed. The authors analyze how the size of benefits from tax deferral will change if the current tax code reverts to the pre-Bush levels, as scheduled. The authors provide a set of formulae that can be used to estimate the size of tax benefit arising from tax deferral under varied scenarios.","Babbel, David F, PhD;Reddy, Ravi", Feature,Oct,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Fixed annuities , Tax deferred privileges , Tax benefits , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Retirement Income Sustainability: How to Measure the Tail of a Black Swan,"The last few years have been especially challenging for financial advisers, partially because of extreme stock market and interest rate movements. These events were unprecedented and outside conventional forecast ranges. This paper describes a new methodology for measuring the overall risk embedded within a retirement income plan, motivated by the existence of ""black swans,"" an idea introduced by Nassim Taleb in his best-selling book The Black Swan: The Impart of the Highly Improbable. The SORDEX ratio, which is fully explained and illustrated within the article, is defined by the simple relationship A/B - 1, where A is retirement income sustainability given current conditions and B is retirement income sustainability under extreme conditions. The greater the value of this SORDEX ratio, the more vulnerable is the retirement income plan to a black swan. The authors suggest that, for the purposes of implementation and using this new measure, extreme conditions should be defined as events that are likely to occur less than 1% of the time, within a three-year time frame.","Milevsky, Moshe A, PhD;Abaimova, Anna;Cavalieri, Brett, CFP, ChFC", Feature,Oct,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Models , Financial planners , Ratios , Risk management , Retirement planning , Retirement income , Sustainability , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Twelve Indicators You Need to Update Your Estate Plan,"Congress is on the verge of passing legislation that will retain the estate tax and the current ""step up"" in basis rules while setting the estate tax rates and exclusion amount going forward. Many clients have been postponing revisions to their estate plans until the changes occur. Here are some indicators you need to update your estate plan: 1. How is incapacity determined in the client's estate planning documents, and are the methods consistent? 2. Is there a HIPAA authorization? 3. Does every member of your client's family who has attained age 18 have a power of attorney for healthcare and a living will (or an advance healthcare directive)? 4. Do the documents allow for planning during incapacity? 5. Does your client only have a will and not a revocable living trust? Estate plans provide protection in the event of incapacity and death. With the changes coming to the estate and gift tax laws, more clients will be reevaluating their existing estate plans.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP", Feature,Oct,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Changes , Tax rates , Client relationships , Estate taxes , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Founders of the Profession Look Back on the Roots of Financial Planning,"With the financial planning profession celebrating its 40th anniversary, two of its founders, Lewis G. Kearns, 95, and James R. Johnston, 76, recently took the opportunity to reflect on the profession's humble beginnings. On Dec 12, 1969, 13 individuals with various backgrounds and interests in financial products and services gathered in Chicago to consider a more integrated, client-centered approach. Before integrated financial planning, clients who wanted to get their financial lives in order might visit an insurance agent first, to buy a life insurance policy. Johnston is waging a one-man campaign to achieve recognition for Kearns, whose contributions he believes had huge implications not only for financial planning but for the study of microeconomics.","Ritchlin, Lance", Feature,Oct,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Careers , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Because the profession is relatively new, the first wave of major retirements is around the corner at a time when entry points into the field and career path progression aren't well established. The challenges the profession as a whole is struggling with mirror many of the challenges individual planners are facing.

The Emerging Adult and the Financial Planner: Seven Years Later,"Since the 1960s, many psychologists and sociologists have used a developmental model created by psychoanalyst Erik Erikson. This model organized the human lifespan into eight stages extending from birth to death. The phenomenon of extended adolescence has been recognized by psychologists as a distinct new period of life that will be around for many generations to come. Based on his research, Jeffrey Arnett reports that emerging adults -- young people between age 18 and the late 20s -- see three cornerstones for achieving true adulthood: accepting responsibility for your actions, making independent decisions, and becoming financially independent. If your clients decide to provide financial assistance, it is important for them to clarify up front whether such financial assistance is conditional or unconditional. Emerging adulthood confronts parents with serious life challenges. The emerging adult continues to need his or her parents' psychological and emotional support, and sometimes their financial support.","Gallo, Eileen, PhD", Feature,Oct,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Child development , Financial planning , Models , Client relationships , Adults , Psychologists , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Journal has been a leader in exploring what has become, with considerable debate, the growing acceptance of life planning, recognizing that financial planning involves the heart as well as the dollars.

Market Cycles and Safe Withdrawal Rates,"Financial markets move in long-run cycles. These long-run patterns of the US financial market -- called secular cycles -- significantly affect safe withdrawal rates (SWR). This paper covers the history of US secular cycles over 120 years, the mechanism leading to cyclic market behavior; and why financial planners should be aware of long-run market cycles when developing suitabte SWRs. Secular cycles are examined using the behavior of the S&amp;F 500 Composite Index from 1881-2000. During this period, the average annualized compound growth rate of the index was 4.8%. In comparison, during this same period the annualized compound growth rate of the four secular bull and four secular bear markets averaged 3.3% and -1.4% respectively. Secular market cycles can result in lower SWRs because the sequence of investment returns matters in the presence of recurring portfolio withdrawals. Financial planners can benefit from an awareness of secular market cycles by considering their effect on sequence risk when forming SWR recommendations.","Harris, John, PhD, CFP, RFC", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Growth rate , Bull markets , Studies , Business cycles , Indexes , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Future of Retirement Investing,"Recent market declines are responsible for erasing decades of wealth building by investors who are in or near retirement. A recent Gallup Poll shows that for the first time this decade, a majority of non-retired Americans, 52%, doubt that they will have enough money to live on comfortably once they retire. Retirees of the future know they'll have to reduce needless expenses and somehow convert their portfolio of stocks and mutual funds into one that generates as much income as possible during retirement. One way of accomplishing their retirement goals is for these investors to swap 100% of their equity and bond mutual fund holding for a similar exchange-traded fund (ETF). ETFs are highly liquid securities with ultra-low management fees that can be 80% less than a typical mutual fund. However, the main advantage in taking an old school approach to invest is the ability to sell call option premium on the ETFs now owned in the account.","Ulivieri, William, AIFA", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Polls & surveys , Investment policy , Exchange traded funds , Savings , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Many planners simply do not have the time to follow all of the complicated micro- and macroeconomic variables needed to manage a portfolio by any other methodology.

Life Insurance in Times of Uncertainty,"Through the 1970s, there were two primary types of insurance policies -- term and whole life. Term allowed all insured to purchase inexpensive protection for a specified period, usually one year. Whole life offered permanent protection at a fixed rate throughout the insured's lifetime, in contrast to the increasing cost of term insurance, provided that the premium is paid. The primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be death benefit protection. Most individuals will need to employ life insurance as part of an overall financial plan to ensure their family is taken care of due to the early death of a breadwinner. Fixed income investments also provide all opportunity for investors to take advantage of temporary down market cycles by creating the liquidity to purchase attractive equity assets at low cost. As the events of the last year or so have demonstrated, in low interest rate and down market environments, whole life insurance policies are an attractive alternative to other funding vehicles.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Alternatives , Fixed rates , Insurance policies , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

APPLIED PLANNING: How Planners Screen Investments,"Many factors play into a financial planner's decision about which investment allocation best addresses a client's long-term financial goals. When funneling down to the investment vehicle itself though, planners often make product selections based on the technical side of comparing one investment to another by analyzing various screens. The FPA Research Center conducted a Trends in Investing study in 2008 and 2009, asking members the frequency with which they use a laundry list of potential screening factors for investment vehicles. This article also provides comparisons between the 2009 and 2008 studies, but because the answer options were slightly different in each survey, it only points to percentage differences where stark shifts are apparent. It may be expected that planners will always place greater value on the long-term investment performance screen than on short-term performance, and the survey bears this out, along with other intuitive results.","Nelson, Christina", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Polls & surveys , Investment products , Asset allocation , Investment policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Out of Bounds: Cross-Border Planning,"Globalization has been shattering barriers not only to international commerce, but to international living. And the growing ranks of people and families with substantial assets and legal connections outside the US are giving rise to a complex but potentially rewarding professional niche: ""cross-border financial planning."" Meanwhile, experienced cross-border planners (CBPs), happy to share accounts of the rewards and challenges of their multinational careers, warn that cross-border planning presents a minefield of legal and financial traps for the novice or unwary, and thus is not a fail-safe opportunity for mere dabblers or short-term opportunists.

Bear Market Makes Wealthy Investors Bullish on Financial Planning ...,"According to the 2009 Phoenix Wealth Survey produced by The Phoenix Cos Inc, more wealthy investors -- those with a net worth of $1 million or more, not including primary residences -- are embracing the financial planning process, with 39% indicating they have a formal, written financial plan, up from 34% last year. And among investors with a formal plan, 21% consider their plan extremely important to their financial planning efforts, up 16% from last year. Common reasons why wealthy investors shop around include investment performance and fees, lack of proactive contact from their current adviser, and their adviser not offering the products or services they need.",Anonymous, News,Aug,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Polls & surveys , Bear markets , High income , Wealth management , Investments , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How Much Is That Basis Point Worth?,"Mutual fund expense ratios and loads, along with adviser fees and wrap account charges, are among the many ways in which investors pay for investment management. Unfortunately, to assess trade-offs between alternative fee arrangements expressed in fractions of a percentage point requires a facility with exponential series (that is, time value of money calculations) that too many investors lack. The proper procedure is not to focus on the magnitude of the expense ratio in relation to the forecast returns, but to calculate dollar results for the two exponential series. All basis points are not created equal when they figure in exponential series. This is the dark side of what is sometimes referred to as the magic of compound interest. The higher the rate of return, the more costly a single basis point of additional expense becomes. Wrap fees can be far more expensive than they first appear.","McQuarrie, Edward F, PhD", Feature,Aug,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Fees & charges , Investors , Mutual funds , Compound interest , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Good Grief,"Although most of the people probably think about taxes when estate planning is mentioned, there are important non-tax considerations. For many years, the American Bar Association's (ABA) focus on these non-tax issues was directed at such technical topics as valuation, insurance, and asset protection planning. Seven years ago, the ABA's Section on Real Property, Trust, and Estate Law established the Committee on the Emotional and Psychological Issues in Estate Planning. For more than a year, a substantial portion of the Committee's monthly telephone conference has dealt with one of the most paradoxical issues facing those people who are routinely involved in postmortem estate planning, a term commonly used to refer to the implementation of estate plans after the death of the testator. Estate and financial planners must deal with both facts and feelings in order to be effective and efficient.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Commentary,Aug,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Committees , Associations , Financial planners , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

She has been clear that she supports a consistent standard of care for different financial services providers that are giving the same kind of services to retail investors.

Comparing Strategies for Retirement Wealth Management: Mutual Funds and Annuities,"This article compares wealth management strategies for individuals in retirement, focusing on trade-offs regarding wealth creation and income security. Systematic withdrawals from mutual funds usually give opportunities for greater wealth creation at the risk of large investment losses and income shortfalls. Fixed and variable life annuities forgo bequest considerations and distribute the highest incomes. Defined contribution plan participants should be aware of contract terms, because fees and charges play a nontrivial role in altering wealth creation and income levels. In-plan institutional pricing of funds may provide better opportunities than lump sum purchase on retail terms. None of the strategies obviously dominates, so the best advice may be to segment wealth to establish minimum necessary consumption and hedge against longevity risk, then focus on growth opportunities. Investors should also optimize portfolios to account for benefits from defined benefit plans and Social Security.","Pang, Gaobo, PhD;Warshawsky, Mark J, PhD", Feature,Aug,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Mutual funds , Retirement plans , High income , Defined benefit plans , Wealth management , Defined contribution plans , Annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Changing Role of the Financial Planner Part 1: From Financial Analytics to Coaching and Life Planning,"The first part of a series on the changing role of the financial planner is presented. An online survey was sent to 38,810 members of the Financial Planning Association and CFP Board mailing list participants, to determine the non-financial coaching and life planning activities of financial planners. Approximately 25% of the respondents' contact with clients is devoted to non-financial issues. About 74% of planners estimate that the amount of time they are spending on these issues has increased over the last five years. Most respondents believe that their non-financial coaching and counseling makes them better planners and helps their clients, but are less certain that these activities increase business. Planners help clients with critical issues that reflect human drama and frailties: religion and spirituality, death, family dysfunction, illness, divorce, and depression. Most respondents have at least some training to equip them to help clients with non-financial issues, but 40% have had no training or professional development in this area.","Dubofsky, David, PhD, CFA;Sussman, Lyle, PhD", Feature,Aug,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Roles , Polls & surveys , Client relationships , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Less Appreciated Aspects of Indexing vs. Active Management,"A perennial question is whether to use index or active mutual funds. It's an important question -- even more now that exchange-traded funds offer large and small investors alike the opportunity to index virtually all corners of the capital markets. Everybody likes to outperform, and mutual funds that outperform their peers are lauded for their success. In some studies of index vs. active, performance is treated as a binary variable. ""Price"" refers to the management fees charged by active funds. A knock against active management is that it is doomed to fail. The world of investing can easily accommodate both actively managed and index funds. That creates, however, a burden for the adviser to be thoughtful in deciding if and when to use one or the other or both. When it becomes time for you to make that decision, be thoughtful about the many nuances of the decision.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA", Feature,Aug,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Investors , Decision making , Mutual funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Economist Marci Rossell on this Economic Crisis and the Next,"In an interview, Marci Rossell, former chief economist for CNBC, talked about the financial crisis, the US government's intervention measures, and the next possible meltdown. According to Rossell, US is at the bottom of the decline -- it is stabilizing. In almost every financial crisis, there is phase one, the contagion phase, which is what happened in September and October of last year. Large institutions become extremely distressed, credit markets start to break down and stop functioning properly, interest rates on anything but the absolute safest government-issued debt suddenly get quite high. She also said that the danger zone goes back to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organizing a $3.6 billion bailout of Long Term Capital Management during the Asian crisis. It changed people's expectations of what government would do. It's the essence of moral hazard. Next problem spot: US Treasuries. They're overvalued -- it's as simple as that.

The Trusted Adviser Paradox,"As an adviser, your clients' trust is the foundation of your business. While your technical guidance and tactical execution are fundamentals of your practice, enduring client trust is built through your ability to connect deeply with those you advise. It may seem that the recipe for becoming a trusted adviser to your clients is to be the best at what you do -- to have the greatest technical proficiency, be the smartest in the field, have the most respected network of colleagues, and the most unrelenting dedication to those you serve. Physical fatigue, lack of mental clarity, stress exhaustion, and fractured focus diminish your ability to connect with clients, which is essential to building trust. By putting yourself first -- meaning that your performance-enhancing self-care practices are ritually a priority in your schedule -- you will reduce the attention that your own body and mind demand, and increase your ability to focus solely on your client.","Keffeler, Kristin Wehner", Commentary,Jul,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Trust , Guidelines , Investment advisors , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Averting At-Risk Middle America's Retirement Crisis,"At-Risk Middle America is defined as individuals with annualized household incomes of $30,000 to $100,000. At-Risk Middle American households often lack the financial resources, preparation, support systems, and protections to carry them through the rest of their lives, and they are particularly vulnerable to the retirement decumulation crisis. Financially, mentally, and culturally, At-Risk Middle Americans are terribly unprepared to fund their third stage of life. This paper presents the findings of a NEFE think tank addressing decumulation issues for this population, the most important of which address eight critical decision zones: work, Social Security, the house, insurance products, defined benefits pensions, defined contribution plans, debt, and fraud. The paper reviews changes in media attention brought about by recent economic developments, but concludes that, whether by design or default, the specifics of how these households will manage to pay themselves a regular retirement paycheck will go unanswered unless Americans work together to reach At-Risk Middle America.","Neiser, Brent A, CFP", Feature,Jul,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Charitable foundations , Investment policy , Retirement planning , Defined contribution plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
WHEN COUPLES CLASH OVER FINANCES,"Even in the best of times, an occupational hazard of financial planning is getting caught in the crossfire between squabbling spouses whose skirmishes over money can not only cause acute social awkwardness, but threaten their economic security. Today, many planners are getting a crash course in keeping marital intolerance from defeating a financial plan -- and in avoiding getting sucked into the maelstrom. Another estate planning decision that frequently causes tension involves the decision of what to leave to children from a prior marriage, according to Patrick Dougherty, CFP, of Dougherty Financial Management in Dallas, TX. A final common source of conflict between spouses, seasoned planners say, involves varying levels of risk tolerance. Some disagreements can be resolved with a creative compromise engineered by the planner. Unfortunately, there are times when a simple compromise or a creative, if not simple, solution cannot bridge the gap. Dougherty, in contrast, prefers a gentler, if more time-consuming approach.","Stolz, Richard F", Cover Story,Jul,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Couples , Conflict , Occupational hazards , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Optimal Retirement Age Under Normal and Negative Market Conditions Considering Social Security and Private Savings,"From one financial perspective, the optimal age for men to begin collecting Social Security (SS) is when the present value (PV) of those cash flows is greatest. Gender is an issue in calculations because future cash flows are weighted by the probability of living to receive them. In this study, a man's life expectancy is used to weight the cash flows at various ages. SS cash flows are relatively certain, barring the very real possibility of the government changing current law. This paper will combine the two cash flows to arrive at an optimal retirement age under normal market conditions and different proportions of income derived from SS. Sixty-two is the optimal age of retirement for a man based on the PV of mortality-weighted combined income from SS and savings withdrawals at age 62 for any subsequent retirement age up to age 70, discounted at a range of discount rates and real rates of return.","Tucker, Michael, DBA", Feature,Jul,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Comparative analysis , Investment policy , Social security , Retirement planning , Cash flow , Portfolio management , Age , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"The Art of Resilient Capital Planning for Executive Compensation, Estate Planning, and Philanthropy","In these volatile and challenging economic times, business owners need a more resilient and holistic approach to business succession planning. The author presents a Resilient Capital Planning model for executive compensation, estate planning and philanthropy designed to integrate the personal and business demands related to many facets of business owner planning. The model relies upon three core tool sets: self-correcting strategies, values-based decision-making, and dynamic stress-testing through the use of scenarios. The model stress-testing goes far beyond simple sensitivity analysis. The entire plan is mapped and then programmatically challenged using classical scenario analysis. This model helps articulate and document the business owner plan so the entire advisory team can coordinate effectively. The Resilient Capital Planning model helps broaden the planning scope and integrates self-correcting and values-based planning techniques to position the business owner to achieve his or her long-term goals.","Bronfman, Mark C, CPA", Feature,Jul,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Philanthropy , Models , Studies , Succession planning , Investment policy , Executive compensation , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

But population is scarce and there is little to no infrastructure. Demographics, psychographics, the fallout from the bear market meltdown, and an energized and activist regulatory climate, has changed the game. A recent survey noted that even with a growing shift from commissions to fees, in the financial services industry as a whole, fees account for 35% of revenues. Conversely, 65% of revenues are from transactions. If the only source of compensation is a commission, a product is the focus -- not advice about lift solutions and non-financial resources.

For those who do not want to pursue or maintain dual registration, this shows an opportunity for Investment Adviser Representatives and registered reps to form mutually beneficial professional alliances.

The media have publicized a few of these strategies, but there is hidden treasure in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and other recent legislation. Over half the workers in the US will benefit from the making-work-pay credit included in the ARRA. Two changes are directed at retirees. First, qualified retirees, disabled individuals, and supplemental security income recipients, including many government retirees who are not eligible for Social Security benefits, will receive a $250 one-time payment in 2009. Second, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 suspended the required minimum distributions from retirement accounts in 2009. The ARRA provides estimated tax relief to individuals with 2008 adjusted gross income less than $500,000 who certify that at least 50% of their gross income came from a business that employed fewer than 500 persons during the year.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD", Feature,Jun,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Economic policy , American Recovery & Reinvestment Act 2009-US , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Tax credits , Estimated taxes , Social security , Taxpayers , Retirees , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
PRACTICE TRENDS: The Business Value of Financial Planning,"Now, more than ever, people are recognizing the business value that financial planning services provide. In the second quarter of 2008, Cerulli Associates examined this very issue with FPA's membership in a survey. They asked advisers again in November to rate the importance of a variety of business benefits that financial planning offers their practice. Nearly two-thirds of respondents indicated that they view financial planning services as a revenue generator independent of investment advice. There is one area of disconnect, however. Eighty-five percent of respondents said they are willing to offer financial plans as a value-added service, yet 66% seek to profit from financial planning services. It is interesting to note that, while 85% of advisers agree that clients are demanding more comprehensive services, less than half of clients are actually receiving a comprehensive plan. This may be due to client demands.","King, Rebecca", Feature,Jun,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Polls & surveys , Advantages , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Occupational Income Betas for Financial Advisers,"Previous research has shown that a person's occupational income variability affects the level of risk aversion within a portfolio. This paper hypothesizes that a person's income variability is occupation-specific and that an occupational income beta, using a best fit index can be developed for any occupation. Occupational income betas, the outcome from this study, can be used by financial advisers as an asset allocation tool when developing and rebalancing client portfolios. This paper establishes beta coefficients for a variety of occupations relative to stocks, bonds, and T-bills. The paper establishes goodness of fit to determine the amount of explained variance using r2, finding, in most cases, that variations in occupational incomes could only be somewhat explained, and that, in most cases, the explained variance was low. The paper concludes with a summary of how financial advisers can calculate occupational income betas and how each beta can be assessed and used when working with clients.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP;McGill, Samantha", Feature,Jun,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Risk aversion , Fixed incomes , Treasury bills , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS: Understand Consumer Spending to Better Serve Clients,"This article analyzes some of the data from the 2007 Consumer Expenditure Survey in attempt to help financial planners better understand the spending habits of different target markets according to income levels and specific client situations, such as preparing for retirement or recently divorced. Americans modestly increased their spending in 2007, keeping pace with inflation -- a smaller spending increase than reported the year before, which could indicate overall tighter budgeting and fiscal responsibility. The average American household's before-tax income in 2007 was $63,091, a 29% increase from the average $44,649 reported in 2000. The staggering number of baby boomers planning for and entering retirement means financial planners are faced with the challenge of helping these clients anticipate post-retirement spending, budgeting, and withdrawal strategies. Planning for healthcare costs is one of the great unknowns in financial planning. What planners can do, however, is help clients estimate their annual healthcare spending, based on national averages for their age group.","Schulaka, Carly", Feature,Jun,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Family income , Health care expenditures , Statistical data , Consumer spending , Market surveys , Budgets , Retirees , Baby boomers , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Elephant in the Life Insurance Industry,"An elephant is standing in the middle of the life insurance industry. The elephant's name is fiduciary standard. Although the elephant hasn't wreaked too much havoc yet, he has caused quite a stir with CFP professionals and others who work with insurance products, especially in the captive agent marketplace. Certified Financial Planner (CFP) practitioners must explore expectations and legal implications that the fiduciary standard brings to their businesses. The requirement to utilize a fiduciary standard was adopted by Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc and became effective in July 2008 and enforceable in January 2009. CFP professionals who work with any type of insurance must carefully document their intent and the processes used to analyze goals and objectives.

Guiding Your Small-Business Clients Through the Downturn Maze,"Although most economists would probably agree that all types of business are experiencing some degree of suffering, the common assumption is that the garden-variety small business -- dry cleaner, restaurant, landscaper, caterer, consultant -- is hurting the most. On the other hand, many small businesses are not only surviving, they're exhibiting confidence about the future. According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses have historically helped stem the effects of the kind of crisis people are now experiencing: following the recession of the 1990s, new small businesses helped usher in an era of tremendous prosperity by creating 3.8 million jobs, a figure that surpassed big business expansion by nearly 500,000. In an odd way, this may be one of the best times for financial planners to market to and work with small-business clients. The big advantage right now is that planners can get their business owner clients' attention. Of course, not all small businesses are in growth mode -- not now, sometimes never.","Lee, Shelley A", Cover Story,May,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Expansion , Financial planners , Small business , Economic crisis , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Equity Indexed Annuities: Downside Protection, But at What Cost?","Ideally, investors would like to participate in the price appreciation of stocks, while protecting themselves against downside price movements during bear markets. One solution currently capturing much attention has the generic name of protected investment product (PIP), or principal protected security (PPS). A common form of PIP is an equity indexed annuity (EIA) contract, offered primarily through banks and insurance agents. As pointed out by Palmer (2006), when acquiring an EIA contract, neither the investor nor the insurer buys stocks. The investor buys an insurance contract that is guaranteed by the general assets of the underwriting company. The following descriptions cover some of the critical elements common to most EIAs: 1. minimum guarantee or ""floor"" value of the contract, 2. index participation rate, 3. the yield-spread cost factor, 4. the growth-rate cap, 5. premium bonus credits, 6. surrender charges, and 7. market-value adjustment.","Collins, Patrick J, PhD, CFA, CLU;Lam, Huy, CFS;Stampfli, Josh", Feature,May,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Dividends , Equity indexed annuities , Portfolio performance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Sticking to Our Principles,"Shortly after the State of the Union address, Pres Obama discussed his desire regarding a revamp of financial services regulation. Most of the President's comments concerned large structural issues that affect capital formation and laid out some basic principles, with little said about the regulation of advice. A few organizations that view financial planning as a distinct profession have come together to espouse a united message. As you may have heard, FPA, CFP Board, and NAPFA have created the Financial Planning Coalition, and declared a few commonalities. For many, there were times when financial planning felt like being in the publishing business, all geared to producing a book of data that clients found hard to absorb. These concerns also surfaced during the development of practice standards. There must be standards in place for how planners conduct their planning work if planning is to have any meaning.

"Cecil Hemingway on Replacement Ratios, Retirement Thinking, and Our Long Tail Problem","In an interview, Cecil Hemingway, EVP and US retirement practice leader at Aon Consulting, talked about changes to the income replacement ratio over the years, its value for planners and consumers, and the ""long tail"" problem Americans are mostly ignoring -- longevity risk. The 1980 results from the President's Commission seemed adequate for a period of time, until the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Since tax rates are a key driver of the replacement ratio, it prompted their interest in knowing how those changing rates would affect the replacement ratio. On a relative basis, higher income people get less tax relief at retirement; thus, the higher replacement ratio. Lower income people can exclude a larger percentage of their Social Security benefits from taxation. The Pension Protection Act certainly offers a lot of ways to help people help themselves. It makes it easier, but it doesn't force them. As people migrate to a defined contribution world, they're losing a very important protection -- longevity protection.","Lee, Shelley A", Interview,May,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Changes , Low income groups , Tax rates , Retirement planning , Social security taxes , Ratios , United States--US , Hemingway, Cecil",ProQuest One Academic
'Millennials': Strategies for Financial Planning with a New Generation,"Financial planners are undoubtedly aware of the importance of anticipating change. Nothing is more disturbing to a financial planner than when a breadwinner becomes disabled without disability insurance or dies without life insurance. Financial planners continually prepare clients for change -- yet many financial planners themselves may not be prepared for changes that will affect their practices. This paper presents evidence that will help financial planners understand the next generation of financial planning clients, the Millennial generation. This group's significance will continue to rise as they inherit the vast wealth accumulated by their baby boomer parents. Given limited promotional budgets, financial planners need to consider the characteristics most valued by potential Millennial clients. Planners who want to target Millennials can benefit from understanding the basis on which they will be evaluated. A financial planner hoping to capture Millennials as future clients may be better served by charging an hourly fee for services instead of working on commission.","Johnson, Scott D, PhD;Larson, Stephen J, PhD, CFP", Feature,May,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Polls & surveys , Demographics , Millennials , Baby boomers , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Over the past six months, the author has faced situations he had not previously encountered. Clients and potential clients have reached out to him for advice when they were at the edge of the financial cliff, ready to jump off. The most irrational reaction involved a potential client who decided to start a non-deductible IRA and put the entire investment amount into the stock of one company in 2008. The stock had become completely worthless by the end of 2008, and the potential client contacted him to discuss whether this loss could be deducted on his 2008 tax return.

The Roth IRA for Children: Multigenerational Wealth Planning,"The Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) was established under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and has become a popular investment strategy. As expected, most investors in Roth IRAs are working adults. However, children (even very young ones) can make qualified Roth IRA contributions if they have compensation. The traditional IRA was introduced under the Employee Retirement Income Security Art of 1974 (ERISA) and offered tax-deferred growth on investments. In 1997, legislators went a step further and created another kind of IRA, commonly referred to as the Roth IRA, for the legislation's chief sponsor, Senator William V. Roth of Delaware, which offered tax-free growth on investments. A key difference between the Roth and traditional IRA concerns the taxation of contributions. The strongest argument for young Roth IRA owners and their beneficiaries is clear; competitive tax-free growth. The authors encourage professional planners to consider this highly tax-advantageous multigenerational wealth planning strategy.","Haug, Mark G, PhD, JD;Cichelli, Adrienne G", Feature,May,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Children & youth , Financial planning , Financial planners , Advantages , Roth IRAs , Employment , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Developing a Tech Strategy,"You can't run a financial planning or wealth management business without the right technology. But for some advisors, technology is as much a source of aggravation as profit. Their frustration is understandable because it seems they are always reacting to unwanted tech changes that are beyond their control. In contrast, other advisors are satisfied with their systems. This article explores how these advisors have mastered their systems and shares their insights for getting in front of the tech curve. Once you've developed a strategic plan and identified your firm's core strategies, it's time to include a technology strategy. The arrangements of who makes the tech decisions vary among advisors. No matter how your firm manages technology, however, failing to develop a tech strategy or abdicating responsibility for that strategy to a third party is risky. Staying current with technology isn't an option -- it's a critical element to developing and maintaining a viable strategy that keeps you in front of change.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP", Cover Story,Apr,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Technology adoption , Technological planning , Strategic management , Advisors , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Anatomy of a Currency Hedge Fund,"The article details characteristics and risks of hedge funds to help planners determine when hedge funds are appropriate. Two notable characteristics of hedge funds include market neutrality and the potential to increase diversification in a portfolio. Seven sources of risk are high leverage, liquidity risk, pricing risk, reporting risk, fee risk, operating/cash management risk, and attrition risk. The nature of each risk is explored. A comprehensive example, using currency futures, illustrates how a specific strategy may be used in a hedge fund. It assures planners that complexities surrounding hedge funds are overstated and that investment alternatives are within the grasp of most planners. Use of the unbiased hypothesis relative to the random walk hypothesis helps to explain currency markets. The unbiased hypothesis states that the forward rate is the best predictor of the spot rate for the future. The random walk hypothesis claims that today's spot price best predicts tomorrows spot price.","Basu, Somnath, PhD;Atkins, Allen B, PhD", Feature,Apr,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk , Financial planners , Portfolio diversification , Hedge funds , Hypotheses , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

In many ways, though, everything depends on being true. The false gods of modern portfolio theory or absolute return strategies have been replaced by the new deities of fixed annuities or bonds.

A Dynamic and Adaptive Approach to Distribution Planning and Monitoring,"This paper advances the ""second-generation approach"" to the sustainable withdrawal rate question. The study evaluates the ongoing sustainability of the withdrawal rate that is revisited every year. This adaptive approach recognizes that sustainability decisions do not occur just once at retirement, but should change as situations warrant throughout retirement. To support ongoing sustainability decisions, annual probability of failure of the current withdrawal rate is presented in this paper, summarized in five-year slices through the data. As a person ages, this allows for slowly changing to higher withdrawal rates associated with those shorter remaining distribution periods. Revisiting the withdrawal annually allows for higher withdrawal rates if the portfolio performs well, for unplanned or unforeseen additional expenses, or for lowering withdrawal rates if the portfolio is underperforming. The revisiting approach introduced in this paper is simpler than some of the complex decision rules that have been previously introduced, and is therefore easier to implement and change as the client ages and portfolio values change.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA;Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP", Feature,Apr,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Retirement planning , Portfolio performance , Rates of return , Sustainability , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Low Interest Rates Make Charitable Lead Trusts More Valuable,"The current low-interest environment has enhanced the value of charitable lead trusts (CLTs), also known as charitable income trusts for clients who want to benefit charity and transfer assets to their children at a reduced gift- or estate-tax cost. A CLT is an irrevocable trust to which the donor transfers income-producing property. The CLT makes payments to one or more charities for a number of years specified in the trust document. The transfer of assets to the CLT is treated as a taxable gift by the donor to the noncharitable beneficiaries. The donor will receive an income-tax charitable deduction only if the CLT is structured as a grantor trust, with the result that the donor will also recognize phantom taxable income during the term of the CLT. CLTs are not particularly good vehicles for transferring assets to grandchildren or other skip persons. In today's low-interest environment, CLTs provide the estate planning client with more bang for the buck than ever.","Gallo, Jon J, JD", Feature,Apr,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Gift taxes , Donations , Interest rates , Income trusts , Charitable trusts , Trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Income Replacement Versus Expense Approach to Insurance-Needs Analysis,"The two primary approaches to insurance-needs calculations are income replacement (also called human capitalization amount), a calculation of the present value of the insured's future income, and the expense approach (sometimes called capital needs analysis or needs fulfillment method), which is the present value of estimated future survivor's expenditures, net of income, or the gap."" The objective of this research is to try to determine to what extent the results of the simpler income replacement approach identify different ""needs,"" based on varied criteria like age bands or different client net worth amounts. It is widely recognized with little or no controversy that the income replacement methodology is an inferior approach to calculating client life insurance needs versus an expense-based analysis. Preferably, financial planners should not use income replacement methodologies.

Neal Solomon on Financial Lessons from Russia and Beyond,"In an interview, Neal J Solomon, CFP, Managing Director, WealthPro LLC, talked about his experiences exploring the world of personal financial management in Russia and beyond, as well as the personal path that led him on that journey. He started by investing his newspaper-route pay and bar mitzvah money when he was a freshman in high school. His parents' financial advisor showed him how to invest in mutual funds. In going to Russia, they hoped to start relationships and to learn. They wanted to determine how Russians get financial advice. They hoped to find out if there were professionals who they would recognize as ""planners"". So the first objective was to learn as much as possible about the status of any financial planning community they could find in Russia.

Timberland Investing for Financial Planning Clients,"As traditional integrated forest products companies sell off their timberland to real estate investment trusts and other investors, timber as an investment is becoming more accessible to the smaller retail investor. This article looks at the various vehicles financial planning clients can invest in for timberland, as well as factors influencing its returns and how it correlates with other types of investments. The article briefly explains some of the basics of timberland, such as the types of timber and how they're harvested, and the three factors that drive price: biological tree growth, timber price changes, and changes in land value. The paper shows timberland's low correlation with other asset classes, and its typically lower volatility. In particular, timberland is an inflation hedge. Timberland has its risks, including physical risks such as fire and disease, so geographic and tree-type diversification is crucial.","Fasano, George A;Straka, Thomas J, PhD", Feature,Mar,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Timberlands , Financial planners , REITs , Portfolio diversification , Institutional investments , Volatility , Timber , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Retirement Future Tense,"Whether clients are preparing for retirement in the future or actually living in retirement now, it is, no doubt, a stressful time for them. There are two versions which characterize the spirit of this time in history for their future clients: ""Retirement Future: Tense"" and ""Retirement: Future Tense"".

Here are some thoughts to consider when working with clients in helping them create a meaningful retirement plan for the future: 1. Retirement success is more than a balance sheet. 2. Retirement can take many forms. 3. Prepare for that second, third, fourth career.

Life Insurance Options for Tough Times,"In hard economic times, investors look for ways to lighten their financial load, and life insurance has its role to play. There are four possible ways that the management of life insurance can assist in such period. First, instead of buying higher-cost permanent policies that generate cash values, many clients can stick with much lower-cost term insurance. Second, when cash value policies are acquired make sure they are low expense so clients can have immediate liquidity. Third, to save cash flow, existing permanent policies' premiums might be skipped. And finally, if investors need funds, they may be able to withdraw or borrow from cash values of permanent policies. Term insurance has no cash value. It has no liquidity component. Whole life, universal life, and variable universal life policies have cash value. But remember that no-lapse UL has low to zero cash values.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Feature,Mar,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Investors , Variable life insurance , Financial planning , Term insurance , Universal life , Insurance policies , Life insurance , Cash flow , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Bengen himself has written several follow-up studies and published a book on the subject, Conserving Client Portfolios During Retirement, making it clear he is anything but glib about the complexity of the topic at hand. Interviews with several seasoned CFP certificants with their own strong views on retirement portfolio liquidation strategies suggest a kind of bipolar view of the matter. Rules of thumb, they say, particularly Bengen's, are helpful, yet potentially harmful. Ross Levin, CFP, of Accredited Investors in Edina, MN, places his misgivings about portfolio distribution formulas on a more philosophical plane. In some cases, planners encourage clients to take steps to reduce optional fixed costs as they approach retirement so they can establish a conservative portfolio distribution rate without cuffing into the client's true quality of life.","Stolz, Richard F", Cover Story,Mar,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Rules , Retirement , Fixed costs , Portfolio investments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The survey also asked planners to forecast when specific tax proposals would be enacted: in 2009, in the next four years, or not in the foreseeable future.

The Next Watering Hole,"Financial planning as a discipline was born amid the financial dislocations of the early 1970s. Rearrangement of the environment, like cyclical changes across the savannah, drove advisors to new watering holes. The growth of consumer-oriented financial coverage in the media accelerated emphasis on fee-oriented services, with a percentage decrease in transaction-based revenues. The slump of 2008 will mark a historical turning point, a paradigm shift of major proportions. The influence of women is reshaping society. They note that while the industrial era valued management and engineering skills, the information era highlighted creativity and networking. Advisors seek to grow sources of revenue not tied to the vagaries of stock and bond markets. Broker/dealers and vendors can either fight the future or help entrepreneurs create it.

The Synthetic Term-Certain Annuity,"Retirees without a spouse normally choose one of two payout options from a defined-benefit plan or a private annuity: a life annuity or a life annuity with a guaranteed period. This article presents what is often a superior alternative: the synthetic term-certain annuity. A synthetic term-certain annuity is a life annuity option combined with decreasing term life insurance or a level-term policy with the value of the coverage lowered each year. This study compares the synthetic term-certain versus the traditional life annuity with a guaranteed period by comparing the cash flows of the two options on an after-tax basis. To make a valid comparison, the advisor must determine an appropriate nominal discount rate and how long the cash flows might continue. Interestingly, however, the choice of the discount rate does not noticeably change the outcomes. The study carefully notes that while the synthetic term-certain annuity is often the superior choice, higher insurance premiums can make it an inferior choice.","McCormack, Joseph P, PhD, CFA;Perdue, Grady, PhD, CFP", Feature,Feb,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Discount rates , Insurance policies , Defined benefit plans , Insurance premiums , Annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Despite the harsh tax treatment for the life settlement provider when the insured dies, many policy holders are obtaining cash for their policies before death by selling them to life settlement providers. Although life settlements are becoming more popular, there are alternatives that may be more appealing to clients depending on their situation. Clients' needs change over time.

Financial planner routinely measure clients' risk tolerance, either formally with a written questionnaire, informally through conversation, or most likely with a combination of the two discovery methods. In contacting prospective sources for this article, it quickly became apparent that advisors unanimously agree on the value of assessing clients' risk tolerance -- that's a given. Many financial advisors frame the risk-tolerance conversation with questions about possible losses. The current bear market creates both a dilemma and an opportunity for gaining a better insight into clients' risk tolerance.

Performance of Levered Closed-End Funds,"Closed-end bond and equity funds often leverage their assets by borrowing during low interest rate environments and reinvesting in securities that pay higher rates, thereby enhancing returns. The risk is that when stock or bond markets significantly decline -- as now -- levered funds will underperforrn versus unlevered closed-end funds. This paper investigates whether leverage improves the performance of closed-end funds by using the traditional measures of portfolio performance by Treynor; Sharpe; and Jensen; the M2 measure by Modigliani and Modigliani; and regression analysis. Results with the traditional measures and the M2 measure indicate that closed-end bond funds usually do not benefit. Results for closed-end equity funds are mixed, but generally do not show higher returns with the use of leverage. Regression results also do not support the use of leverage. Financial planners should be cautious in recommending closed-end funds solely on the basis of their use of leverage.","Martin, Rand, PhD;Malhotra, D K, PhD", Feature,Feb,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Closed end funds , Studies , Regression analysis , Financial planners , Financial leverage , Interest rates , Portfolio performance , Equity funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The second thing he would say to all financial planners is that you can be successful only if you have healthy capital markets. Trust levels are way down on Wall Street firms, and the individual planner has to earn that trust as well.

Counseling Insights from the Last Lap of Life,"Early decisions made at the front end of a working life are often decisions you as planners do not currently influence because both your models and your preferences have precluded you from serving the youngest workers effectively. With the current realities of the market, for your retiree clients who either have not saved enough, endured the misfortune of failing health, or did not choose meaningful work or a loving partner, the last lap of life is proving to be a long, laborious effort. When rounding the bend of that last lap of life, it seems clients may need and want a few things solved. For that to happen they would have needed to lay the foundation years earlier.

Other commentaries would state something like, they don't need more regulation/fiduciary duties/full disclosure; they always put their clients' interests first. There are two groups that need a distinct regulatory system specifically for the financial planning profession: clients and the financial planners who serve them. The public has an increasing demand for advice but the public is unnecessarily, and too often tragically, confused about how to go about getting advice.

Flexible Estate Planning for Married Couples in an Uncertain Estate Tax Environment,"Estate planning for married couples requires more flexibility in light of changing federal estate tax exemption amounts over the next three years, and a still uncertain estate tax environment. A return to exemption amounts as low as $1 million or $2 million is not likely even under a Democratic president and Congress, though an amount falling below $3.5 million is possible, considering budget deficits. Planning for estates smaller than $1 million (including IRAs, life insurance, and retirement benefits) is relatively simple. Couples should avoid unnecessarily dividing non-community property assets between them and setting up a credit shelter trust. Medium-sized estates of $1 million to $3 million are the most challenging size of estate, requiring a case-by-case approach. Part of the challenge is not knowing where Congress will eventually place the estate tax exemption amount. Also challenging is that a recovering stock market could dramatically inflate a couple's estate value.","Blase, James G, CPA, JD, LLM", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Couples , Tax planning , Estate taxes , Tax exemptions , Estate planning , Family trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Zero-Risk Market Returns for the Ultra-Conservative Client,"Within any financial planner's client base there may be individuals who will not accept loss of principal under any investment plan. This paper presents three investment illustrations whereby the preservation of principal can be met and have an absolute gain with annual investment returns of 10%, 0%, and -10% for time horizons between 5 and 45 years. The concept is to buy zero-risk discounted US Treasury bills and invest the discount so that only the discount is at risk. When the discounted T-bill matures to face value, the total investment amount will be the face value of the T-bill plus any investment gain on the discount that had been invested in the market at the time of purchase of the T-bill. Using a discount rate of 3% and the historical market return of 10%, the results of investing between $1,000 and $5,000 annually for time horizons between 5 and 45 years show total accumulations of over $5,500 and $1,455,000, with gains over $500 and $1,230,000, respectively.","Muksian, Robert, PhD", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Discount rates , Investment policy , Treasury bills , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Survey of Total State Taxes and Planning Implications for Retirees,"Common wisdom states that retirees often move to sunny locations like Florida and Nevada, both of which are among seven states that have no income taxes, making them attractive to retirees. A variety of other taxes imposed by these states can add up to a hefty tax load, possibly making a state with income tax more favorable to a retiree than a state with no income tax. Changing economic conditions make state and local government tax rates fluid and subject to changes. A financial planner can provide invaluable service by matching the client's post-retirement assets, life expectancy, interests, and lifestyle to a state's total tax burden along with its amenities, and providing the client with rational decision alternatives. This paper reviews the significant components of the retiree's tax burden, and suggests broad guidelines for the client's discussion with a financial planner to maximize income during retirement years while considering family and health-related issues.","Raghavan, Kamala, DBA, CPA, CFP", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Tax rates , Tax planning , State taxes , Retirees , Income taxes , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
When Should Retirees Retrench? Reducing the Need with Part-Time Work and Annuitization,"Saving enough to cover living expenses at the beginning of retirement with a 4% annual withdrawal from investments is a good, sustainable goal, according to numerous studies. But what should individuals do who have to retire without adequate savings? An earlier paper developed a Retrenchment Rule to answer this question. Using this rule, most retirees will want to withdraw significantly more than 4% to avoid painful reductions in their standard of living. Doing so, however, runs an uncomfortable risk of very low withdrawals late in retirement. But withdrawing less and retrenching more initially is not cost effective. Nevertheless, most retirees will want to reduce the risk of very low withdrawals late in retirement. This strategy is to annuitize a large portion of the investment and seek part-time employment. Minimal part-time earnings provide a measurable reduction in the risk of a reduced standard of living, and maximal earnings significantly reduce the risk, as well as increase the future median value of the estate.","Pye, Gordon B, PhD", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Standard of living , Risk management , Investment policy , Retirees , Retirement planning , Part time employment , Variable annuities , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Can Personal Financial Planning Save Us from Bubbles?,"You have experienced two of the largest bubbles in the history of recorded market returns, starting with a technology boom in the mid-1990s that crashed over the 2000-2002 period, followed by a real estate investment frenzy that began in the wake of the technology crash and whose recent unwinding has resulted in year-to-date losses of at least 40% for virtually every major stock index. The author has several observations about how did this happen. First, being smart does not immunize one from ""herding"" behavior. The inability to separate increasingly short-term professional horizons from long-term personal goals can lead one directly into herding behavior. So what can personal financial planning do to save you and your clients from bubbles? The key is in the financial planning process, in particular the goal-setting aspect. Your goals are yours alone, independent of any other person's goals. Logically, what others are doing to achieve their goals is not relevant to you.","Ciccotello, Conrad S, JD, PhD", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Goal setting , Financial planners , Stock prices , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Long-Term Care Insurance for the High Net Worth Client,"Most financial planners agree that long-term care insurance is an essential component of any well-conceived risk management plan. While increased life expectancies over the last century have allowed many individuals to enjoy longer retirements, a consequence of increasing longevity is the greater need for more medical services, particularly at the end of life. Long-term care insurance covers the risk that individuals may need medical and custodial care, either at home or in a skilled nursing facility, at some point in their life. Long-term care insurance should be considered in most financial planning situations, regardless of the net worth of the individual and despite conventional wisdom that suggests otherwise. High net worth individuals can benefit significantly from long-term care insurance, and even clients with lower net worth who would like to retain the ability to choose the source of care could benefit from buying a long-term care policy.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Long term care insurance , Financial planning , Risk management , Equity , Insurance coverage , Long term health care , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Is Markowitz Wrong? Market Turmoil Fuels Nontraditional Approaches to Managing Investment Risk,"As the US economy began to skid under the weight of the international debt crisis, talk went from buy and hold to a search for a safe harbor. And that search went wide-well beyond equities and bonds. Recent surveys show that an industrywide search for alternative investment choices was in full swing in the second half of 2008. Robert Brown, PhD, CFA, with Genworth Financial Asset Management, defines asset management as some variant on Markowitz mean variance optimization -- in other words, the contention that each asset category can be successfully characterized by an inherent, fundamental, stable set of summary statistics -- mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients. If that's the way the world works, then you can take those ingredients and you can develop a superior portfolio that over a time period will actually generate a superior result. That's the inherent premise of traditional 1990s asset allocation as practiced by the financial planning community in large measure.","Holton, Lisa", Cover Story,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Economic crisis , Risk management , Investment policy , Asset management , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Joint Life Expectancy and the Retirement Distribution Period,"Past distribution research has focused primarily on determining sustainable withdrawal strategies based on fixed distribution periods, such as 30 years. While such research provides valuable information as to the likelihood of a portfolio failing over a predetermined period, it does not directly address the primary goal of retirees: to provide income for life. For most retirees, a retirement income strategy is likely to be deemed a failure only if it fails while either or both members of the retired couple is still living. Based on this logic, this paper will explore the implications of using joint life expectancy versus a fixed period when determining the appropriate initial sustainable real withdrawal rate for a distribution portfolio. Based on the research conducted for this paper, a sustainable withdrawal rate based on a joint expectancy period results in a 1%-2% higher withdrawal rate for the same probability of failure than one based on a comparable fixed period.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA;Blanchett, Brian C, CPA, CFP, AIF, CFA", Feature,Dec,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Life expectancy , Studies , Withdrawals , Retirement plans , Retirees , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
How Do Planners Regard Regulation?,"A survey of FPA members in March and April of this year revealed that most would prefer professional regulation to self-regulation by the brokerage industry. According to Duane Thompson, managing director of FPA's Washington office, planners are very concerned about the potential for excessive regulation with a self-regulatory organization (SRO). But if one were proposed, the survey suggests that they would prefer professional regulation by the CFP Board as financial planners, not as investment advisors under an SRO, particularly an SRO administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Nearly two-thirds (61.3%) of respondents to this survey said that they needed more information if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were to propose the creation of an SRO for federally registered investment advisers, including financial planners affiliated with such firms. Financial planners seem to want information and consistency before deciding the kind of regulator they would prefer.","Powell, Robert J, III", Feature,Dec,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Polls & surveys , Financial planners , Regulation , Preferences , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Back to Basics: Helping Clients Manage Cash Flow,"As the author writes this, it is the beginning of week three of the current financial crisis. During the weekend, almost every conversation he had with friends and family members revolved around the financial markets, his opinion of the markets, and the actions they should be taking. Over the course of the weekend, his response centered on the theme of ""control what you can control, make the best decisions you can, and everything else will sort itself out."" While people often seek technical and complicated solutions to problems, often what they need is to simply get back to the basics. What is fascinating about the responses from planners is that they are in direct conflict with their experience in working with clients. As they explain their cash management system and the philosophy behind it to clients and prospects, they are eager to finally understand their spending. Perhaps they would all be better off if centered on the basics and focused on how each of them can make their decisions more intentionally.","Kies, Eric H, CFP", Feature,Dec,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Decision making , Economic crisis , Cash management , Cash flow , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Work Less, Be Healthy, Make Money","Vestment Advisors partnered with FPA to create the 2008 Financial Adviser Survey on Physical and Mental Health. Nearly 300 financial advisers, all FPA members, responded to their 50-question survey. The results offered interesting information about how health and business success go hand-in-hand. Of the financial advisers they surveyed, over 81% of respondents reported working more than 40 hours a week, and 47% reported working 51 or more hours a week. Over 15% are actually putting in more than 60 hours every single week. Clearly, the top priority for a majority of these responding financial advisers is to bring in more clients and make more money. The second largest response to the magic wand question, with over 35%, was a desire for more time off for self/family. Financial advisers need to realize is that this service-based industry does not reward the hardest working adviser as much as it does the most effective adviser.

On whether female entrepreneurs with more moderate incomes are adequately supported and represented, Firestone said there is a middle market for women business owners of multi-million-dollar companies but not high-end revenue. On whether a woman entrepreneur faces the same obstacles as her female compatriots with different incomes, Firestone said there are various obstacles depending on the type of business and where it is located, such as whether the company is product or service or manufacturing, or locally or nationally based. On key factors that make women business owners successful, Firestone said the key factors are innovation, drive, and achievement.","Mahli, Paramjit", Interview,Dec,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Associations , Success factors , Trends , Entrepreneurs , Women owned businesses , United States--US , Firestone, Marsha",ProQuest One Academic

Understanding the Factors Influencing the Income Gap Between Divorcees,"Divorce is a zero sum game that typically results in a greater negative financial impact on divorced women than on divorced men. But little is known about the factors that cause the different financial consequence between genders. Financial planning services and financial planning self-help tools are available to help those preparing for divorce as they embark on legal proceedings; however, little of this advice specifically addresses interfacing financial planning and existing personal factors during the divorce process. Using US Census data from 1980 to 2000 to examine factors including age, children, education, and the presence of a significant other; researchers show that these demographics significantly affect the relative income differential of divorcees by gender. They also find that the trend in income disparity has declined somewhat over the period 1980-2000. The financial planner's role in today's environment requires a shift in client focus, a change in the content of planning information conveyed, and a greater level of awareness of the current Internal Revenue Code provisions related to divorce topics.","Hale, Kelly D;Neidermeyer, Adolph A, PhD;Pearson, Timothy A, PhD;Riley, Richard A, Jr, PhD", Feature,Dec,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Divorce , Women , Demographics , Financial planning , Gender , Wage differential , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Creating Wealth in the 'Overlooked' Defective Beneficiary Trust,"Defective irrevocable grantor trusts are a common tool for estate planners, but the income-tax defective irrevocable beneficiary trust is often overlooked or unfamiliar to estate planners. The irrevocable beneficiary defective trust treats trust property as owned by the beneficiary for income-tax purposes, but not for gift- and estate-tax purposes and, if elected, is not subject to the generation-skipping transfer tax. Therefore, for income-tax purposes, the trust income is taxed to the beneficiary instead of the trust. Advantages of the defective beneficiary trust include favorable income-tax and estate-tax treatment for the trust, ability to pass the trust's beneficiary interests to multiple generations without estate tax, and tax-free transfers between the trust and the trust's owner. One of the greatest advantages of the defective beneficiary trust is the ability of the beneficiary to shift business opportunities to the trust which can produce sizeable wealth generation inside the trust.","Hopson, James F, JD, CPA;Koehn, Jo Lynne, PhD, CPA, CFP;Hopson, Patricia D, CPA", Feature,Dec,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Advantages , Irrevocable trusts , Transfer taxes , Estate planning , Generation skipping tax , State court decisions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Changing Role of the Financial Planner: From Financial Analytics to Coaching and Life Planning,"This article provides an overview of results from a recent survey on the changing role of the financial planner. This article also explores the implications of this research and how it applies to you and your practice. A survey was e-mailed to 38,810 financial planners who are members of the CFP Board and/or the Financial Planning Association. Because some financial planners do not have direct contact with clients and because some planners may view their role as ""purely"" financial planning, researchers asked respondents if they ever engage in non-financial coaching and counseling. Of the 1726 planners who answered the question, 1540 (89%) answered yes and 186 (11%) answered no. They were astonished at the array of human frailties emerging in the client-planner relationship. Suicide (10%), therapy (7%-9%), and drugs (3%-5%) are issues that their respondents encountered.

Estate Planning and the 2009 Increase in Exemptions and Exclusions,"By the time this column is published, people will be getting ready not only for the inauguration of a new president but also for a significant change in the transfer tax system: the scheduled 2009 increase in the estate tax exclusion and the generation-skipping tax exemption to $3.5 million, as well as the increase in the present interest annual exclusion to $13,000. Given the potential significant revenue loss from an estate tax repeal and the current financial crisis, it appears highly unlikely that Congress will allow the scheduled estate tax repeal to occur in 2010. Estate planners routinely advise clients to view their estate plans as works in progress and to review and possibly revise those plans on a periodic basis.

Life insurance premiums for estate planning purposes are primarily transferred to irrevocable life insurance trusts via gifts. Adding up estate assets and recommending life insurance in half this amount doesn't get the job done. Estate planning life insurance should make the not-so-subtle distinctions of what types of assets are involved and what people planning issues can be handled.

The Hedonic Pleasure Index(TM): An Enhanced Model for Spending Inflation,"This paper challenges the accepted use of the Consumer Price Index as the benchmark for spending inflation in simulation software and safe-initial-withdrawal studies. The author deconstructs CPI-U to explain why the price index is a poor measure of spending inflation and proposes an alternative measure (the Hedonic Pleasure Index) based on individual consumption growth. This paper uses data from the Bureau of Economic Affairs Personal Consumption Expenditures from 1929 through 2006 and the Bureau of Labor Statistics annual Consumer Expenditure Surveys from 1984 through 2005. Simulation results using real consumption growth of 55 basis points during retirement required an additional 7.55 savings, which in turn reduced the safe initial withdrawal rate threshold by 30 basis points. The paper concludes that inflation assumptions in simulation software should focus on client consumption behavior not government price indexes.","Shambo, James A, CPA/PFS", Feature,Nov,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Models , Withdrawals , Consumer spending , Inflation , Consumer Price Index , Consumption , Simulation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

When Does a Bonds-First Withdrawal Sequence Extend Portfolio Longevity?,"This paper explores the effect of the withdrawal sequencing decision on the longevity of retirees' portfolios by comparing the strategy of consuming bond assets first with two other strategies: consuming stocks first, and maintaining a 50/50 stock/bond portfolio. The authors find that consuming bonds first extends investor portfolios 90% of the time over the other methods. However investors who consume bonds first transition to the riskiest portfolios, with significantly higher annual volatility than the alternative strategies. The current spread of stocks' long-term earnings yield over bond yields is less than 1%, indicating that the expected return on US stocks and the equity risk premium are near historical lows. The signal indicates that for retirees in 2008, taking on the increased volatility of the bonds-first strategy is not worth it as the strategy is unlikely to result in the same extension of portfolio longevity as it has historically.","Weigand, Robert A, PhD;Irons, Robert", Feature,Nov,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Stocks , Withdrawals , Bond portfolios , Investment policy , Retirement planning , Rates of return , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Becoming Consumers of the Profession We Practice,"This article discusses why few planners are planner-clients, the personal and professional benefits of being a planner-client and how to select your own planner. Planners' reasons for not hiring their own financial planners are largely the same as any prospective clients. Even the most common objection from planners -- why should they pay someone else to do something they can do -- echoes the objection of many prospective clients. Perhaps most surprising for planners who have become planner-clients are the professional benefits they realize. These include increased understanding of the client experience, deepened ability to communicate the value of financial planning, experiencing another planner's processes, and creating new ideas for one's own practice.

Craig Karmin on Whether the Dollar Is Still as Sound as a Dollar,"In an interview, Craig Karmin, Wall Street Journal reporter and author of Biography of the Dollar: How the Mighty Buck Conquered the World and Why It's Under Siege, talked about how the dollar has the weight of the world on its shoulders and how the dollar is still to be celebrated for its uniqueness and stamina. Karmin said that he started at the Journal in 1999, covering the overseas stock markets, with the dollar as a secondary beat. In 2004, when the dollar started to fall more rapidly in the second half of the year, his editors asked him to focus on it. He did a lot of thinking about the special status the dollar has in most people's lives and wondering if that status was in jeopardy. He added that the dollar's decline during the last seven years has been orderly and slow and there are significant positive benefits from a weaker dollar -- it has helped exporters, it helped slow and reduce the trade deficit, and it's been a huge boon for foreign tourists in the US.","Lee, Shelley A", Interview,Oct,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Reporters , Books , American dollar , Foreign exchange rates , United States--US , Karmin, Craig",ProQuest One Academic
RiskCAT: A Framework for Identifying Maximum Risk Thresholds in Personal Portfolios,"This paper presents a framework -- RiskCAT -- that allows planners to determine a single risk profile score for clients. The RiskCAT framework extends the concept of multiplicative modeling as proposed by Cordell (2002). The challenge is that standardization does not yet exist within the profession to incorporate valid and reliable measures of risk tolerance, risk capacity, and time horizon. This paper offers prospective definitions for each input. A value-at-risk method for validating risk profile scores is presented. The paper demonstrates that the application of RiskCAT profile scores to client situations results in a unique way to define systematic risk and place limits on risk; exposures within client portfolios.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP", Feature,Oct,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planners , Portfolio investments , Risk assessment",ProQuest One Academic

Many Estate Planning Strategies Provide Benefits in Low-Interest-Rate Environment,"Interest rates are lower than they have been in years. For May, the federal Section 7520 rate was 3.2%, down from 5.6% one year ago, though for July and August the rate climbed to 4.2%. Several estate planning strategies provide benefits in their current low interest rate environment, as well as some that should be avoided. In funding a grantor retained annuity trust (GRATs), it is best to use property that is expected to appreciate at a rate greater than the Section 7520 rate. Intentionally defective grantor trusts (IDGTs) are also advantageous in this low-rate environment. IDGTs are trusts designed to intentionally tax the income to the grantor instead of the trust because of the compressed tax rates applicable to trusts. Charitable remainder annuity trusts (CRATs) are also similar to GRATS, except with a CRAT the remainder interest passes to charity. The annuity has to exceed 5%, and a 10% interest in the assets has to pass to the charity.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD", Feature,Oct,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Interest rates , Remainder interests , Tax benefits , Grantor retained annuity trusts , Estate planning , Trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Using Behavioral Investor Types to Build Better Relationships with Your Clients,"This paper intends to make the application of behavioral finance easier by building on key concepts outlined in the author's earlier March 2005 Journal of Financial Planning article, ""Incorporating Behavioral Finance into Your Practice"" and his 2006 book, Behavioral Finance and Wealth Management. Financial services have learned a top-down method of identifying a client's behavioral investor type. By learning this process and applying it before creating an investment plan for a client, the client is more likely to be able to adhere to a plan that is custom designed for them and, when this happens, financial advisors build stronger relationships with their clients. As a final note, advisors should realize that clients will have stronger or weaker forms of the behavioral investor types presented here based on the number and severity of the biases that are associated with each behavioral investor type.","Pompian, Michael M, CFP, CFA", Feature,Oct,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Investment plans , Behavior , Client relationships , Advisors , Behavioral economics , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

DeeAnn Thompson, a partner in Thompson Jones LLP estate tax consultants in Monterey, CA, agreed with Barber about the importance of marketing and stressed the role of networking in developing a successful practice. The importance of mentors in avoiding fatal missteps was stressed in her conversation with Stephanie Guerin, CFP, and Kelly Voitenko, CFP, founders of The Planned Approach Inc in Kansas City, MO.

The Financial Planning Act of 2008,"Several recent events have inspired much debate about how the financial planning profession should be regulated. Yet planners have reached no consensus as to whether such regulation should be conducted by a state licensing or a federal self-regulatory structure. This article advocates a state licensing approach in the belief that federal authorities do not understand the financial planning profession well enough to properly regulate it. To stimulate debate over a state licensing approach, the article provides a sample state bill that establishes a state board to license and regulate financial planners. The bill is a blending of a number of state statutes and proposed statutes for varying occupations. The bill would make it illegal for anyone, with limited exemptions, to practice financial planning or use any language that implies they practice financial planning without being licensed by the state board.","Moisand, Dan, CFP", Feature,Oct,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Bills , Financial planners , Federal regulation , State laws , Licensing , Licenses , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
FIRST AID for Clients in Emotional Crisis,"In a ""perfect"" world, organized, level-headed, self-disciplined checkbook-balancing clients would present themselves in a serene state, with all of their financial and personal affairs in order, eager to be advised on how to map out a tidy plan built on a pre-existing solid foundation. But the reality for most planners, for better or worse, is to deal with earthlings who don't come close to that description. Although particular categories of personal trauma may demand crisis-specific counsel and client interaction techniques, general principles apply to many situations, planners say. ""Getting it"" for planners includes the ability to quickly determine whether a client in crisis is too preoccupied or foggy to digest important information. In some cases, clients' emotional needs may be basic enough that an empathetic planner could meet the need -- but not economically.","Stolz, Richard F", Cover Story,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Emotional disorders , Trauma , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

When Should Retirees Retrench? Later Than You Think,"Saving enough to sustain a given standard of living with a 4% annual withdrawal from investments is a good goal. Studies show that such a withdrawal has good sustainability. Many people, however have to retire well before accumulating enough assets to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living at this sustainable 4% rate. This paper develops a Retrenchment Rule to determine when retirees should reduce their standard of living, and by how much. This rule depends on a discount rate. The surprising finding of this paper is that much of the retrenchment should be deferred, rather than implemented right away. Using the Retrenchment Rule with an 8% discount rate, retirees should withdraw significantly more than 4% to avoid painful retrenchment.","Pye, Gordon B, PhD", Feature,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Retirement , Investments , Standard of living , Discount rates , Retirees , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The authors are exploring the benefits of converting a traditional IRA (tax-deferred withdrawals) to a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) with many of their clients. By no means is this a cutting-edge planning idea, but it has renewed relevance due to the tax landscape and the elimination of the adjusted gross income limit. Although many factors will influence your decision-making, one factor that should take a front seat is retirement plan contributions and distribution strategies. Hopefully these suggestions will help you advise your clients down the pivotal homestretch.","Supper, William J, CFP;Cocozza, Christopher R, CPA, JD, LLM", Feature,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Decision making , Influence , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Consider that hundreds of millions of people around the world suddenly have something they have never had before: discretionary income. Countries whose combined populations dwarf that of the US are experiencing unprecedented growth, prosperity, and economic clout. An almost unimaginable amount of money will be spent in new places and all this spending will stimulate new markets and new investment opportunities. Investors who fail to recognize the economic and financial market decoupling that is occurring may miss an important opportunity.

On a macro level, the release of the RAND report and the Treasury ""blueprint"" have kept the issue of the regulatory elements of accountability on the minds of the financial services industry participants. Almost every planner the author knows can recite a number of cases in which another advisor put a client into something in a way that complied with regulations but, when viewed from a financial planning perspective, was simply wrong. The code of ethics and practice standards represent a filter for determining the acceptability of planning services. Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems with offering the marks as the solution to the regulatory gaps.

Benefits and Management of Inflation-Protected Treasury Bonds,"Treasury bond funds vaulted to the top of the fixed-income category in 2007 and smartly outperformed the US equity markets. Inflation-protected Treasury bond funds (TIPS) did even better returning almost 12% for the year. These returns reflect a decline in interest rates and, for TIPS, underforecasted inflation. TIPS had been expected to be less volatile than conventional Treasury bonds, but the record does not support this. Because the returns and volatilities of TIPS are likely to be comparable with those of conventional Treasury bonds over long periods, portfolios should generally contain substantial proportions of each. Individual TIPS provide a variable cash flow because the inflation adjustment is not paid until maturity or sale. A ladder manages this variation, Buying at the original auction eliminates tax amortization issues. Individuals should generally locate TIPS inside a pension or IRA for tax efficiency. This location also eliminates tax complications caused by amortization and inflation adjustments.","Lingane, Peter Jane, EA, CFP", Feature,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Inflation , Treasury bonds , Volatility , Portfolio management , Bond funds , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Why You Are Not a Good Comprehensive Financial Planner,"Estate planning is an area that most CFP practitioners recognize is fraught with issues. For practitioners, the biggest issue is the recognition that, unless you are an attorney, you have to be very careful not to practice law. Of all the areas planners tend to bail on, property and casualty insurance is probably the most popular because, as a topic of interest, it is probably the least popular. The fact of the matter, though, is that property, casualty, and liability insurance mistakes can destroy a financial plan that is otherwise exemplary. Sometimes these issues aren't mistakes as much as they are oversights or failures to monitor changes in the client's situation. Smaller organizations typically overlook the need for coverage or can't afford it on their meager budgets. If you know, or have reason to suspect, that your client is on such a board, you should ask if he or she is properly covered.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Shein, Jay, CFP, CIMA, CIS", Feature,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Liability insurance , Property & casualty insurance , Insurance coverage , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Asset Minimums and How Planners Get Paid,"Rare is the planner who will be in business for an extended period of time if they charge $1,000 in fees when it costs them $2,000 to deliver services to a client.

Earlier this year, Cerulli Associates (CA) surveyed FPA planners about asset minimums and discovered some interesting things. More than 80% of advisers require clients to have at least $100,000 in investable assets before a financial planning engagement becomes a realistic outcome, and more than 50% set the minimum asset level in excess of $500,000. Despite the varying degrees of complexity involved in planning engagements, a surprisingly high number (37%) of advisers use set fees for plans, and a nearly equal amount do not charge for plans at all, instead considering them a value-added part of their client relationships.","Powell, Robert J, III", Feature,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Fees & charges , Polls & surveys , Assets , Affluence , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Data Dependence and Sustainable Real Withdrawal Rates,"Past research on sustainable real withdrawal rates has been overwhelmingly based on past market returns. Such research ignores the possibility, and consequently the implications, that future market conditions will vary from those in the past. This paper will explore the impact of varying returns and standard deviations on a distribution portfolio in order to provide the reader with information on appropriate sustainable real withdrawal rates for various market conditions. Experts predict that the future market return for a balanced 60/40 portfolio is likely to be 1%-2% less than historical averages. Over longer distribution periods the return of a portfolio becomes increasingly important in maintaining the likelihood of success of a distribution portfolio. A 1% decrease in portfolio return is likely to result in an increase in the probability of failure that is approximately 4 times greater than a 1% increase in portfolio standard deviation.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA;Blanchett, Brian C, CPA, CFP, AIF", Feature,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Standard deviation , Rates , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Life Expectancy: What's the Right Number?,"Every reader of this article has probably, at one point or another, asked their clients some variation of the ""what's your time horizon"" question. This question gets trickier as clients get older. For the near- or in-retirement investor, the advisor must consider the life expectancy of the client. This question pushes the advisor out of the comfort zone of investments and into the waiting arms of the actuarial sciences. Avoidance is not an option, as the many ubiquitous calculators that advisors use to help with retirement planning all tend to require an input to this question. So what's the right number? To answer that, it's important to understand a few aspects of life expectancy. These are: 1. Headline life expectancy isn't relevant. 2. Your clients aren't average. 3. It's getting better all the time.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA", Feature,Aug,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Life expectancy , Financial planning , Actuarial assumptions , Advisors , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Income-Harvesting Strategy: Achieving Inflation-Adjusted Income from a Lump-Sum Asset,"There are currently several strategies available to produce retirement income from a lump-sum asset. Some of the strategies compared with the income-harvesting approach introduced in this article include systematic withdrawals, guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits associated with variable annuities, and time-segmented withdrawal strategies. To build a new strategy, it was necessary to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the current income strategies. In developing new ideas for income distribution it is possible to implement a strategy that allows a client to harvest gains achieved from the equity markets and use them as income later in the plan. Income harvesting takes the focus away from expected returns and places an emphasis on the volatility of the equity markets. To accomplish this, the authors created four investment accounts which are: 1. income guarantee account, 2. equity withdrawal account, 3. equity harvest account, and 4. the derivative protection account.","Parker, Zachary S, CFP, LUTCF", Feature,Aug,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Income distribution , Retirement plans , Income , Lump sum distributions , Investment policy , Equity , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Do not become too dependent on any one client. 2. Examine whether it's worth it. 3. Remember that people are watching. 4. Understand that sometimes it is not about you. 5.

Guiding Clients Through the Mortgage Mess,"Although mortgages are grabbing headlines, as more financial advisors have moved to an assets-wider-management model, there is a risk that clients' mortgages will receive less attention than under a traditional financial planning model. That's not to imply that advisors overlook mortgages and debt management-many cover those areas with every client. But advising on mortgages doesn't pay the bills. The shift toward focusing exclusively on wealthier clients also changes the practice of advising on mortgages. Those clients usually have sufficient assets to avoid the problems cropping up for lower- and middle-income homeowners. They also receive professional advice on debt-funding options and avoiding excessive borrowing. Wealthy clients aren't immune from the current crisis, of course, as evidenced by problems in the jumbo loan market. Frequently, however, mortgages and other debts have a less prominent role in these clients' finances than they do for the less affluent.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP", Feature,Aug,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Mortgages , Debt management , Client relationships , Advisors , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Unintended Consequences: When Good Estate Plans Cause Bad Problems,"The law of unintended consequences says that actions often have unanticipated effects. Adam Smith was talking about the law of unintended consequences when he observed that the public interest is served when each of you, seeking only your own gain, is led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. In his iconic 1936 article, ""The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action,"" sociologist Robert K. Merton identified the five sources of unanticipated consequences. He called the third source ""the imperious immediacy of interest,"" which refers to situations where the intended consequences are so important that you overlook unintended but reasonably foreseeable effects. This article focuses on the application of the effect of imperious immediacy of interest on estate planning.

The impact of RMDs is analyzed in two distinct ways: using fixed rates of return on a tax-deferred portfolio and using rates of return that incorporate real-world variability. The paper also investigates four coping strategies and their models, and the results from both the fixed and the random models are presented. One of the coping strategies is to reinvest any excess RMD withdrawal into a brokerage account.

Building a Business That's Fit to Sell,"In 1983 the author sold his financial planning business to Sage Holdings of Johannesburg, South Africa. The main point of this article is to provide a summary of he built this business over a 19-year period (1987-2006) and then sold it. The way he built the business had to fit his personality. One point should be very clear. Without realizing it at the time, the relationships created with people over these years had a huge impact with very positive results. In 2002 he had a total hip replacement.

Draining the Swamp,"The recent flap over the disciplinary process at CFP Board has captured the attention of various media writers, leaving certificants wondering on what's going on again. The author's purpose is not to defend anyone or pick sides in this most recent incident. His hope is that if he can provide you with more of a historical perspective, you can gain a better sense of how really good people serving the profession can have wildly divergent world views. One of the biggest issues facing the current board of directors and CFP Board staff is sorting through the issue on why CFP Board keeps doing goofy things, both legally and culturally -- for the long term. Most issues that are communicated by CFP Board chairs are way more complicated than what can easily be explained in a memo -- both from a legal and compassion perspective.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU", Feature,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Professions , Corporate governance , Boards of directors , Writers , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Thinking About a Roth 401(k)? Think Again,"The choice whether to contribute to a regular 401(k) or a Roth 401(k) combines simple arithmetic with difficult projections of future tax rates. This article will show that the answer to the question on what the client's tax rate will be in retirement is often not what is commonly believed. The article addresses the specific case of the affluent wage earner client, and shows in an easy-to-grasp way why future effective tax rates for this group are unlikely to rise by much. Most affluent wage earners who are not truly wealthy can reasonably project effective future tax rates lower than their current marginal rates and hence should favor regular 401(k) accounts over Roth accounts. Financial planners are responsible for understanding the benefits and costs of each type of retirement account, and recommending the one most appropriate to the client at hand. Financial planners have an opportunity to add value by assisting with this choice.","McQuarrie, Edward F, PhD", Feature,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Advantages , Financial planners , Workers , Tax rates , Roth 401k plans , Effective income tax rates , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Financial Planning for Clients Considering a Continuing Care Retirement Community,"Facing increasing life expectancies, many clients will explore the possibility of living in a continuing care retirement community (CCRC). The financial advisor can provide insight on the financial implications of this decision. CCRCS provide three levels of care: independent living, assisted living, and skilled nursing care, and the ability to move from one level to the next. If clients express an interest in CCRCs, they should check immediately to see if there is a waiting list. Some can be very long. Pre-planning is vital for CCRCs. Amenities, from swimming pools to meal plans, vary dramatically from facility to facility, and CCRCs bundle such amenities differently. Funding the sometimes steep entrance fees takes careful planning and timing. Tax considerations are also important. Financial advisors can help clients estimate the potential need for higher levels of care in order to determine what type of CCRC facility to enter.","Mayes, Sarah L, CPA;Nelms, Linda L, CPA, CMA", Feature,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Life expectancy , Retirement communities , Fees & charges , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

VUL Policies Work with Astute Management,"Variable universal life (VUL) allows policyholders to control how their policies' premiums are invested by selecting from various mutual funds available. Most VUL buyers select equity funds. In contrast to VUL, whole life and universal life policy premiums are mostly invested by the insurance company in investment-grade bonds held for yield. Therefore, investment results for whole life and universal life will change relatively slowly and are backed by a minimum guarantee, which means the cash values can never take a loss. By far the largest problems with VUL involve policies with level death benefits. It is impossible to know how much and the timing of premiums with such investment volatility. Variable universal life policies are a bit like diabetes. Real problems are likely to occur if left unattended, but with wise management, both can be nicely handled.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Feature,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Variable life insurance , Universal life , Equity funds , Death benefits , Insurance premiums , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Reaching Out to the Next Generation: Educating Your Clients' Children,"The New Retirement Mindscape, a comprehensive study of retirement attitudes by Ameriprise Financial, in conjunction with Age Wave and Ken Dychtwald and Harris Interactive, illuminates a retirement planning need: educating children about money. Amazingly, for 52% of the survey respondents, the top priority is not investment management plans or estate planning strategies, but simple instruction and advice to help their children become more financially savvy. Reaching out to educate your clients' children not only satisfies your clients, but presents a way for you to establish relationships with the next generation. When it comes to educating clients' children about money management, Patrick Dougherty, CFP, of Dougherty Financial Services in Dallas, TX, says many of his clients miss a golden opportunity because they don't encourage their children to get a job. With the long-term, big picture as a foundation, Dougherty uses the college planning process as a vehicle for financial education.","Opiela, Nancy", Cover Story,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Education , Guidelines , Polls & surveys , Children & youth , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Three-Legged Stool Redux,"Financial planners might be able to bring back the time-honored three-legged stool which had been, until recently, the traditional sources-of-income model for retirement. The three-legged stool model has been shelved and replaced with the four-legged chair model to accommodate the role of work as a part of the traditional retirement income sources that include pensions. While baby boomers are more disposed to this expanded definition, many still hold onto vestiges of the old retirement model. Even though many of the baby boomers have enjoyed the advantage of an education, white collar jobs, and life in suburbia, this lifestyle may have come at a high price on the Maslow hierarchy. One approach to prepare clients for their retirement futures is to broaden their perspective about the retirement plan by incorporating the revised three-legged stool model as a way to describe the philosophical underpinnings of retirement preparation. The plan needs to reflect three important qualities: it must be grounded, resilient, and nimble.","Savage, Diane C, CFP, CRC", Feature,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Baby boomers , Financial planners , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Determining the Proper Starting Balance for Taxable and Tax-Deferred Savings at Retirement,"General, investment savings consist of both taxable and tax-deferred savings, each of which has unique taxing characteristics, and there is an optimum allocation between taxable and tax-deferred savings at the start of retirement. The optimum taxable and tax-deferred savings allocation at the start of retirement is defined as an allocation that will result in maximizing the retirement savings in the year before the year in which the required minimum distributions exceed the required use-of-savings, termed the ERMD-YR. The theoretical optimal savings allocation is that initial allocation in which the starting taxable savings are depleted in the ERMD-YR and minimal use of retirement savings is required before the ERMD-YR. In the five to ten years before retirement, the allocation decision for contributions between taxable and tax-deferred savings should be based on the optimum target allocation at the start of retirement.","Bernacchi, Ben T, CFP", Feature,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement , Asset allocation , Tax allocation , Tax deferred privileges , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Financial Planner's Guide to the FHA Insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage,"Reverse mortgages have been highly marketed and promoted over the past few years, with the dominant product being the Federal Housing Administration's home equity conversion mortgage, or HECM. This article is designed to help financial advisors thoroughly understand the mechanics of the HECM, compare it with other retirement options such as a home equity line of credit, and determine if the HECM should be considered as a component within a client's long-term financial plan. This article provides an in-depth review of the main formulas and variables that make up the HECM. Through a series of cash-flow illustrations, it presents the costs and benefits of using various home-equity based strategies to increase cash flow in retirement. Particular attention is paid to the client's risk tolerance and personal preferences.","Skarr, Douglas", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Investment products , Financial planning , Reverse mortgages , Benefit cost analysis , Equity , Lines of credit , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Beyond the Red Zone: Retirement and Long-Term Care Planning,"Three words that have generated intense interest in the financial planning community over the past decade are retirement, baby, and boomers. The tip of the baby boomer iceberg is approaching retirement age, and in spite of a series of infamous financial debacles, the iceberg is still afloat. In a prominent advertising campaign, Prudential has referred to the period five years before and five years after retirement as the Red Zone. For a context of the post-Red Zone discussion, it is useful to revisit some of the economic theory behind retirement planning. As any financial planner knows, long-term care insurance typically provides a flat monthly, weekly, or daily supplement amount when the insured becomes unable to perform two or more of the activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing, using the bathroom, or getting out of bed -- the equivalent of losing household productivity. For planners, setting realistic expectations in the client's accumulation phase can prevent a decline in lifestyle as clients age.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Lemoine, Craig, CFP", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Long term care insurance , Financial planners , Retirement planning , Long term health care , Baby boomers , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Rules of the Road,"The financial planning profession and the financial services industry may find themselves thinking about regulations now that the Rand report is out. The author believes financial planning should be regulated separately from its subsets. The best way to implement distinct regulation is in one of two ways: either a national professional regulatory organization (PRO) or a state licensing regimen similar to that of accountancy. People need good regulation of financial planning in the US because the current system doesn't work very well for the public or practitioners. It takes four main things to get this right and form a piece of good public policy: 1. License people to practice. 2. Require specific behavior. 3. Strengthen enforcement. 4. Resolve disputes. Imagine a world where almost anyone could drive anyway they wanted -- fast, drunk, reckless, whatever -- and nothing could be done about it.

A Context for Considering Variable Annuities with Living Benefit Riders,"This paper provides an objective framework for helping financial advisors assess the merits of variable annuities with living benefit riders. The first part introduces advisors to the current state of academic research on the subject. The second part provides a context for evaluating a variable annuity with a popular guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) rider if such a product had been available for purchase before two historical ""worst case"" market scenarios. A primary finding is that, while the conditions required to cause insurance companies to pay claims under lifetime income benefit riders are rare, carriers do appear to carry real claims risk. Given the potential of variable annuity contracts with living benefit riders to address the single biggest concern of most retirees -- lifetime income sustainability -- the importance of improving disclosure, eliminating conflict of interest, and banishing unethical sales practices cannot be understated.","Robinson, John H", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment products , Riders , Accelerated death benefits , Financial planners , Variable annuities , Advisors , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Take Advantage of the Little Things,"The typical focus of retirement planning mirrors peoples focus on life: the big picture. The little things can help provide them with a truly satisfying life. When they develop a retirement plan for their clients, they keep their eyes on the major items such as systematic contributions to savings vehicles, asset allocation, and asset withdrawal strategies. Yet they tend to overlook the little items that can help them achieve a more satisfying retirement. Health savings accounts (HSAs) were introduced to the tax system to make health care more affordable to the average family. HSAs enable a taxpayer to pay for current health care expenditures and to save for future expenses on a tax-free basis. When advising clients, many planners fall into the trap of focusing solely on the big picture. As in life, financial planning can be much more successful if appropriate attention is paid to the little things.","Supper, William J, CFP;Cocozza, Christopher R, CPA, JD, LLM", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Health savings accounts , Retirement planning , Medical savings accounts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
When It's Time to Move On,"If good personal financial planning is the antidote to a chaotic or unintended financial result for individuals and families, then exit planning for a client's existing business has to be the solution to maximizing the value of the firm and delivering on any other goals the owner is able to articulate. The process for an exit plan looks a lot like the process for a financial plan. First, you gather data. Second, analyze the data. Third, develop an action plan that shows tasks, responsibilities, and a timeline. Finally, guide your business-owner client in the implementation of that action plan. As the advisor, you should provide a contingency plan inside the exit plan. Giving your client clear, understandable choices without overwhelming them with the background work that goes into selling options is important. You can help them make an informed decision that they can turn to if, during or after the implementation, those feelings of ""what have I done"" come up.","Hughes, Bonnie A, CFP", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Guidelines , Financial planners , Contingency planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Small-Business Owners Squeezed by Health Insurance Debate,"As the presidential candidates debate what to do about the 47 million Americans without health insurance and how to manage escalating costs and coordinate care for those with insurance, your small-business owner clients may feel the pressure that comes from being both part of the problem and the key to a future solution. Donald Duncan, CFP, CPA/PFS, CFA, of D3 Financial Counselors in Downers Grove, IL, says that business owners still committed to providing health insurance for their employees often feel as if they are choosing between the lesser of two evils. The general thinking is that although the health insurance system may be dismantled and revised over the course of the next several years, its likely that employers will still end up paying one way or the other.

Leveraged ETFs: A Risky Double That Doesn't Multiply by Two,"This study investigates the long-run return properties of leveraged ""ultra-bullish"" exchange traded funds (ETFs), which seek to multiply the daily performance of market indexes both on the long and short side. Although leveraged ETFs can multiply index returns by a specific amount on a day-to-day basis, long-run returns cannot similarly be multiplied by the leverage ratio due to the constant leverage trap and the lognormal nature of continuously compounded returns. Using Monte Carlo simulation, it is found that a typical 2x leveraged stock ETF is likely to only magnify the index return by 1.4 times on an annual basis for holding periods out to ten years. The paper also compares leveraged ETFs with buying an index fund using a simple margin account. It finds the leveraged ETFs a superior long-term alternative due to their relative lower cost. Given the risk/return trade-off leveraged ETFs offer, long-term investors should be considerably wary. Extreme swings in value are inherent in this type of fund.","Trainor, William J, Jr, PhD, CFA;Baryla, Edward A, Jr, PhD", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Monte Carlo simulation , Leverage , Exchange traded funds , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Is Local Knowledge an Advantage?,"This column tackles the question of whether investor performance is influenced in any way by the tendency to hold more shares of nearby companies. Factors unrelated to expected performance may be the real story behind the tendency to overweight locally. As it turns out, this is a relevant issue not only for individual investors, but institutional investors as well. Coval and Moskowitz (2001) constructed a dataset that matched the holdings of individual actively managed equity funds with the distance from the headquarters of those companies to the fund's location. So while it is intriguing that 35,000 households were, on average, able to achieve some success by overweighting local firms in their portfolios, there's still room at the table for the concept of ""too much of a good thing can be dangerous."" If clients want to execute small ""local"" tilts in their equity portfolios, that's terrific.

Time-Referenced Investment Policies,"Although much of the financial literature typically assumes a unitary time horizon when discussing risk in practice, investors often operate across several different time horizons simultaneously. Investment policies should account for these actual investor practices. In this article, investment policies are tailored to the changing nature of risk and return across three intended holding periods: one year, one to five years, and five years and longer. This article discusses methods for modeling risk. For very long investment periods, including across multiple generations, the investment policy needs to attempt to maximize and protect net worth positions and lifetime consumption. Asset allocation becomes more flexible and capital gains become more critical. By viewing the relevant economic choices to involve consumption today versus consumption tomorrow, investment policies can expand considerably beyond the traditional and more limited trade-off of pricing volatility versus pricing return.","Kaufhold, Kevin C, JD", Feature,Apr,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk , Time , Asset allocation , Investment policy , Volatility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Will Future Equity Risk Premium Decline?,"Financial experts differ regarding the future equity risk premium (ERR) of common stocks versus the ERP of the past, suggesting that ERP may be less useful as a guide in future asset allocations. This paper compares the broad macroeconomic factors that shaped the ERP in the pre-World War II US economy with newer ERP factors to determine if there is a structural shift in the long-run ERP. The paper examines the behavior of the historical equity risk premium for 1870-2002 using the returns on the S&amp;P 500 Index and the ten-year Treasury bond. The changing explanatory power of these factors is tested in the regression model, which supports the contention that the ERP tends to decline in maturing economies. Growth and globalization in the world economy also have likely influenced the declining role of ERP, though the highest risk/return opportunities will continue to come from emerging markets and high-growth maturing markets.","Devaney, Michael, PhD, CFA", Feature,Apr,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Regression analysis , Studies , Macroeconomics , Asset allocation , Risk premiums , Equity , Common stock , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Incentive Trusts and Foreclosure: When Incentives Become Disincentives,"In the words of Marjorie Stephens, author of ""Incentive Trusts: Considerations, Uses and Alternatives,"" incentive trusts are trusts by which clients seeking to control behavior use money to provide incentives for what the client views as ""productive behavior"" and to penalize what the client sees as ""nonproductive behavior."" Incentive trusts sometimes take innovative, if not amusing, forms. To understand why incentive trusts can have a potentially adverse psychological impact on the beneficiaries, you need to understand how you develop your identity, your sense of self. Perhaps the most important falling of incentive trusts is the failure to distinguish between internal and external motivation. Most incentive trusts are drafted from the viewpoint of the goals the client wishes the beneficiaries to achieve. In the author's opinion, a better approach for parents concerned about their children is ask them to think about what would be in their best interests.","Gallo, Eileen, PhD", Feature,Apr,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Motivation , Behavior , Beneficiaries , Trust funds , Incentives , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Standing Out from the Competition,"A basic tenet of marketing is to avoid ""me-too"" products and services. Research shows that top-performing businesses gain a competitive advantage by clearly differentiating themselves in a way that their customers value. Firms that lack differentiation are less successful as measured by a variety of metrics. Advisory firms across the size spectrum and with a range of business models and markets are finding ways to stand out from the competition. Some are achieving their success in smaller, less competitive markets, but others operate in major urban areas. There are numerous options for creating differentiation, but apart from the intangible qualities of personal relationships with clients, it's hard for small and mid-size firms to create sustainable competitive advantages. Developing superior advisory expertise is one possibility, but that assumes the firm can maintain that edge over time. Firms that have differentiated themselves will stand out from competitors. How a firm accomplishes that will depend on the opportunities that present themselves and the firm's ability to exploit those opportunities.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP", Cover Story,Apr,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Success , Competitive advantage , Brand differentiation , Competition , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"A Guide to Serving the Estate and Financial Planning Needs of Gay Men, Lesbians, and Same-Sex Couples","When it comes to issues concerning financial and estate planning for gay men, lesbians, and same-sex couples, there are significant differences from traditional married couples. These differences are becoming increasingly apparent as states adopt laws specifically outlawing or permitting same-sex marriages or civil unions. In this article, the authors address the unique financial and estate planning issues faced by gay men, lesbians, and same-sex couples, and how to work with this underserved niche market. Before sitting down with gay and lesbian clients, advisors should make an effort to ensure that they are prepared to work with the gay and lesbian community. Aside from engendering trust, it is extremely important for advisors to think about how they present themselves and the information they provide to gay and lesbian clients. It is always important to know one's client, regardless of their sexual orientation. But in dealing with gay, lesbian, or same-sex couples, this often means going into more detail about a client's family situation.","Kapp, Joseph;Burkholder, Nicholas E", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Gays & lesbians , Same sex marriage , Guidelines , Client relationships , Estate planning , Civil unions , Advisors , Couples , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Rumpelstiltskin and Financial Planning,"In the year 2025, today's 50-year-old woman will be 67 years old, while today's 60-year-old woman will be 77. Put these facts together with some of the most commonly agreed-upon demographic markers and people can foresee a troubling picture of the future lifestyle that results from women's inadequate retirement planning. Women represent one of the largest potential markets for financial planners; yet women also represent some of the greatest challenges to planners. Financial services professional can help female clients understand the importance of planning for their future by: 1. helping your client identify her beliefs about her responsibility to take care of herself financially, 2. working with your female client to develop specific new financial behaviors that she can adopt, 3. adopting a coaching style with your female client, and 4. seeking opportunities to address women's groups and raise their awareness about the importance of being effective financial decision-makers.","Savage, Diane C, CFP, CRC", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Women , Polls & surveys , Guidelines , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Client Relationships: Covenant or Contract,"Contracts are important documents within the society. They are so important that law students spend a great deal of time studying contract law. Contracts are designed to protect the interests of the parties to the contract. Contracts try to anticipate what can go wrong. From the most ancient times, covenants have represented a solemn promise to form a special relationship in order to achieve an expected outcome. Contracts will continue to be important and necessary documents in their practices. They are unavoidable from a legal, regulatory, practical, and E&amp;O insurance perspective. Yet, over the past 20 years financial planning has experienced an evolution toward becoming a profession, toward a fiduciary relationship with their clients. As a result, they're moving beyond mere contract toward covenant. More and more frequently, their practitioners live on the right side of the chart.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Covenants , Financial planning , Client relationships , Contracts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

She said the Financial Planning Association certainly did a good job of getting out the word about why planning is important. They're on the edge of the mass public recognizing that they do need good advice. Many people really want to hire an hourly, as-needed planner, but they can't find one anywhere near their location. She defines middle America as individuals who fall somewhere between the broad definitions of poverty and semi-affluent -- it's about 86% of all Americans. Until financial planning can figure out a way to make services available to all, they're not a profession.

A Life Settlement Mosaic,"The author's life settlement views are formed from his experiences with clients. Since he is solicited by clients and not the other way around, he takes on what is brought to him. The market for the buying and selling of life insurance policies for investment purposes had a rational basis in the beginning. Almost all other possible life settlement situations should result in the policyowner retaining the policy -- at least until the policy is near termination. The life settlement industry and their solicitors have created the image that many policy owners often come to the rational conclusion they want to sell their life insurance policies and then contact an agent. The appetite for doing life settlement transactions has become so great that the industry has convinced itself that life insurance is so mispriced that the policies of insureds in the same health are attractive targets as well.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Commentary,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Accelerated death benefits , Insurance policies , Life settlement , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Economics' Approach to Financial Planning,"This article briefly describes economics' approach to financial planning and contrasts it with conventional planning. Economics' approach is based on consumption smoothing -- the proposition that households seek to spread their spending power over time as well as across times -- times that are good and bad. In simple situations featuring no uncertainty and no limitations on borrowing, consumption-smoothing, life-cycle spending plans can be calculated using high school algebra. Otherwise their solution requires dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is particularly useful for dealing with borrowing constraints -- the inability of households to fully smooth their living standards without borrowing more money than is feasible or desired. The dynamic programming used to smooth a household's living standard delivers a lifetime spending plan. When retirement spending targets are set too high, households are told to save too much and spend too little before retirement. When it comes to personal finance, economics keeps one issue front and center: peoples living standards.","Kotlikoff, Laurence J, PhD", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Households , Dynamic programming , Standard of living , Budgets , Economics , Consumption , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
SPENDING IN RETIREMENT: Easing the Reins or Pulling Them In,"Helping clients achieve a successful retirement is typically the primary goal of a financial plan, and the focal point of the ongoing financial planning relationship. This is particularly true when clients' personal instincts, financial delusions, or ingrained patterns of economic behavior threaten their well-being in retirement -- either by outliving their assets through overspending, or denying themselves the pleasures of a comfortable material standard of living they can easily afford. The crucial task of at least attempting to get retired clients on track is at the core of a planner's duty to clients, according to Judy Hagar, CFP, of Wolters, Hagar &amp; Pratt Financial Planning in San Diego, CA. If they see their clients spending too much, or they have extra money and they're not being efficient with it, they have an obligation to point that out.

Using Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis to Simplify the Financial Planning Process,"Helping clients make decisions that can significantly affect their lives is one of the critical functions at the heart of the financial planning process. How well that goal is achieved is a true test of the value that the financial planning process brings to a client's situation. Many financial planning events such as where to retire, which college to pick for a child, or which new business opportunity to pursue are decisions that don't readily lend themselves to a traditional mathematical approach. For an HDSM (heuristic decision support methodology) to be useful to the average financial planner, it must satisfy three objectives. First, it needs to help clarify the decision-making process. The second objective is that the methodology greatly simplifies the decision-making process, is user friendly, and is easily understood by the clients. The third and final objective of the HDSM is to provide a baseline decision for whatever problem they have under consideration.","Suplee, William Z, IV, CFA, CFP, ChFC, CASL;Dzubow, Steven R, PhD", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Heuristic , Decision making , College choice , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Pyramid of Success: The Final Chapter,"This ninth and final chapter of the Pyramid of Success has to do with innovation and the sometimes illusory concept of success. There is potential for innovation in at least six areas of the business: 1. ideas, 2. services, 3. systems, 4. processes, 5. products, and 6. marketing. Because innovation starts in the mind it is important to set aside specific times to think about new ideas and evaluate the spontaneous ones. The critical issue is to decide when and how you will implement your best ideas. As you know, giving good service helps determine how long you will keep a client. Good service also produces referrals. Out of all the possible service ideas, you have to carefully evaluate what works for you. The apex of the pyramid simply says ""Success."" You need to define this for yourself. Don't look at success as a destination.

Planned Giving Redefined,"Two pivotal questions have to be answered by a client to set the stage for meaningful dialogue with their planner. The first question is most crucial: How much is enough? The second question: what is your legacy?

Estate planning products and techniques are nothing more than the tools in the tool box used to assemble the plan. They are not the leading indicators of what is important in creating an estate plan or giving plan. The financial planning profession can help facilitate economic well-being, from local communities to the entire world.

Quiet Conversations: The Expressive Nature of Socially Responsible Investors,"Few investment issues are more contentious and fraught with misunderstanding than socially responsible investing (SRI). Part of the objection to socially responsible investing is the mixing of the utilitarian nature of investing with the expressive nature of investing. Studies have shown that from a utilitarian standpoint socially responsible investing performs just as well, on average, as conventional investing. This paper focuses on the author's ""quiet conversations"" with eight socially responsible investors, including a Catholic nun, an environmental planner, a video producer, and the owner of military-related companies. Each investor responds to such questions as what matters most to them as socially responsible investors, do they go beyond socially responsible investments such as volunteer work, are they willing to give up returns for social responsibility, and how they assess companies with mixed SRI records. Financial advisors already accept many investment preferences of clients and construct portfolios reflecting these preferences. They should accept clients' preference for socially responsible investments as well.","Statman, Meir, PhD", Feature,Feb,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Perceptions , Investors , Financial planners , Social investing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Christina Baldwin on Story, Storytelling, and 'Who Put the Honey in Your Heart?'","In an interview, author Christina Baldwin talked about story, storytelling and why story is important to the financial planning relationship. For centuries, reading and writing were elite functions given only to certain classes of people. Story is how people link to each other as human beings, and their ability to link experiences through story creates the basis for all social behavior. In shorthand, the spiral of experience is the ""survivor's story."" Some manage it well; others very poorly. But in the financial planning relationship, the major life event could be a death and an inheritance, a family disintegration, the adoption of children, a retirement. Any of these life events can be extremely disorienting. Approaching every client with the idea of story -- about them and their money -- will make you a better planner.

This article addresses some of those questions. Creating a Web site is simple. Site-hosting companies like Yahoo! offer easy-to-use templates that can create a site in minutes. The technology is available to build client-centered sites. While it may take several years to see the impact, financial planning firms that ignore these technologies and fail to create client-centered sites risk finding themselves at a competitive disadvantage.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP", Cover Story,Feb,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Web sites , Technology , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Recent Developments in Long-Term Care Expenses,"One reason medical expense deductions are greater for higher-income taxpayers is the deductibility of medical expenses associated with senior living. Seniors residing in nursing homes (skilled-nursing units) because of their need for medical care may deduct all of the monthly charges, including expenses for meals. One of the fastest-growing expenditures for states is Medicaid disbursements for nursing home care. Medicaid is available for residents whose assets and income levels dip to benchmarks set by the states in accordance with federal guidelines. Recognizing the role that long-term care insurance can play in preserving Medicaid fluids for those who need it most, states are starting to offer incentives to partner with taxpayers who buy long-term care insurance. Congress has already passed legislation that allows the purchase of long-term care insurance with the cash values of life insurance policies and annuities starting in 2010.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP;Salter, John, PhD, AIF, CFP", Feature,Feb,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Nursing homes , Health care expenditures , Health care policy , Long term care insurance , Medicaid , Insurance policies , Medical expense deduction , Long term health care , Nursing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Benefits of Protecting Investment Portfolios with Options: A Historical Perspective,"This paper examines the true effectiveness of options in protecting investment portfolios using 1967-2006 stock index data. Options theory typically ignores the bid-ask spread and has no room for volatility skew. While most expensive, buying near- or at-the-money puts works best. Overall the return is similar to unprotected portfolios, but the risk is significantly reduced. Puts provide the highest reward-to-risk ratios. They should be used by investors who are retired or nearing retirement. Put spreads (buy at-the-money puts and sell out-of-the-money puts) are cheaper than puts, but not effective. They result in lower returns and their risk mitigation is weak. A young investor seeking the highest possible return would be better off with a put strategy or no options. Using quarterly option strategies is better than an annual strategy but if done right, both can work well in reducing risk and enhancing return.","Dubil, Robert", Feature,Feb,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Spread , Portfolio investments , Options trading , Volatility , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Considerations Within Sponsored Tenants-in-Common Like-Kind Exchange Programs,"While like-kind real estate exchanges under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 have been around since 1921, the use of the tenants-in-common (TIC) technique for these exchanges was just approved in April 2002. This article provides guidance in selecting a TIC sponsor: but also alerts advisors and investors to problems within the industry. The tenants-in-common technique allows taxpayers to qualify for like-kind exchanges through co-ownership of property or even multiple properties. The co-ownership is typically handled through a TIC sponsor. TIC owners usually use either a property management company or lease to the TIC sponsor under a master lease structure. Under a master lease, however, the investors ability to recover their investment in an economic downturn is limited.

Dissipation of Life Insurance or Annuity Death Benefits,"In the real world, the reason for receiving sudden wealth, or at least a significant windfall, is often more serious than the byproduct of ""shootin' at some food."" The inflow of funds may be the result of a death benefit from a life insurance policy or annuity, an inheritance, or a legal settlement resulting from traumatic injury. People sacrifice to pay life insurance premiums or to save money in annuities or qualified plans. In most cases they choose their beneficiaries carefully. Dissipation risk -- a measure of the probability and rate of fund depletion -- is not a topic typically studied by financial planners. Still, a positive indication of financial planners' success in curtailing dissipation is that people who receive inheritances tend to deplete their funds more slowly than those who win the lottery or settle a personal injury lawsuit. The common characteristic of life insurance, annuity, or qualified plan beneficiaries is that someone loved them enough to give them some money at death.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Tombs, Joseph W, JD, CLU, ChFC, ARM, CFP", Commentary,Jan,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Life annuities , Life insurance , Beneficiaries , Death benefits , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Leland Model More Accurately Evaluates Efficacy of Portfolio Hedging Strategies,"The debate continues between investment advisors who recommend hedging strategies to their customers and academics who question the claims that protective puts and covered calls increase returns while reducing risk. In this study, researchers examine the debate from the perspective that traditional measures of risk-adjusted performance are misleading. Protective puts work well in volatile markets because they ensure limited downside risk and unlimited profit potential for the life of the option. Covered calls work well for bullish or neutral markets expected to experience little movement for the underlying stock. This study introduces the use of Leland's beta to correctly measure risk-adjusted performance. The measurement captures the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis in stock returns. The study examines a variety of put and call options. The results from the Leland model demonstrate the value of both a protective put and a covered call strategy in reducing portfolio risk without significantly affecting return, though transaction costs will reduce this benefit.","Leggio, Karyl B, PhD;Lien, Donald, PhD", Feature,Jan,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Models , Studies , Hedging , Investment policy , Volatility , Put & call options , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Opportunistic Rebalancing: A New Paradigm for Wealth Managers,"Wealth managers traditionally rebalance portfolios quarterly or annually to control risk due to asset class drifts. This paper proposes a new paradigm for planners: rebalance less frequently, but look more frequently to find the best opportunities for rebalancing. The proposed approach, called opportunistic rebalancing not only controls portfolio drift, but also provides significant return improvements by capturing buy-low/sell-high opportunities as asset dasses sporadically drift relative to each other. The paper studies a wide range of market conditions to show that rebalancing return benefits can be more than doubled compared with the traditional annual rebalancing. These additional benefits, attributed to transient momentum and mean reversion effects, occur sporadically in time and can only be captured by monitoring portfolios frequently. The studies show that trading costs and tax deferral are small compared with rebalance benefits. Opportunistic rebalancing has already been adopted by a number of leading wealth management firms across the US.","Daryanani, Gobind, CFP, PhD", Feature,Jan,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Financial planning , Risk factors , Wealth management , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Alien Concepts: Navigating the Labyrinth of Rules Applying to Gifts and Estates of Non-U.S. Citizens,"This ""quick-reference guide"" examines some of the rules dealing with gift and estate tax when one or both of the clients are non-US citizens. Whenever a client is identified as a non-citizen, the financial planner has immediate tax and estate planning issues to consider. The first task is to determine whether the client -- or the spouse, if applicable -- is a resident alien or a non-resident alien. Once citizenship and domicile status have been determined, the planner must consider various scenarios regarding wealth transfers, both inter vivos and post-mortem. Two important details to verify are whether a treaty exists between the US and the country where the alien is a citizen or resident, and whether there are any important rules regarding gift and estate taxes. No unlimited marital deduction is available to a surviving alien spouse, unless a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) is used. A QDOT results in tax deferral, not tax avoidance.","Basha, Leigh-Alexandra, JD, LLM;Brown, Cal, CFP", Feature,Jan,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Gift taxes , Marital deductions , Transfer taxes , Tax treaties , Noncitizens , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Are Traditional Indexes the Best Benchmarks?,"Equating the S&amp;P 500 or the Dow with the market might have made sense 50 years ago when investment portfolios were not as diversified.

To fill that need, Alston's firm developed the Market Return Benchmark, which comprises a variety of uncorrelated equity asset classes with their corresponding benchmark. Accordingly, the firm uses the intermediate Treasury indexes from Lehman Brothers or Morningstar as a benchmark. While blended indexes clearly are the fair way to measure diversified portfolios, and can further convince clients of the wisdom of diversification, Ray Benton, CFP, of Lincoln Financial Group, does not see a majority of planners developing customized blended indexes to measure clients' performance.","Opiela, Nancy", Cover Story,Jan,2008,Journal of Financial Planning," Benchmarks , Indexes , Portfolio diversification , Equity , Portfolio performance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Location, Location, Location","In the real estate business it is said that the three most important factors in determining success are location, location, location. A burgeoning body of research suggests that geographic location is also a factor in the decision-making process of equity investors -- both individual and professional -- affecting not only which stocks are held, but whether to even participate in the stock market at all. What was learned from the combination of these studies is that if you live in an area prone to greater stock market participation and you interact with your community, you will have a greater likelihood of participating in the stock market. A more powerful form of influence is the extent to which the location of nearby investors influences the types of equity investments that are made. Is this rational? There are at least three ways of thinking about it: 1. familiarity breeds comfort, 2. familiarity breeds false confidence, and 3. familiarity breeds an informational advantage.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA", Commentary,Dec,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Research , Investors , Influence , Decision making , Securities markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
To Defer or Not to Defer: The Growing Debate over Tax Diversification,"Conventional wisdom has always encouraged prudent investors to sock away as much as possible in pre-tax accounts. But the prospect of higher taxes due to massive federal deficits and the looming specter of a Democratic Congress and presidency have re-ignited debate over the usefulness of a financial planning strategy known as tax diversification, with emphasis on the word debate. Tax diversification hedges against changes in future tax rates by spreading tax risk across diverse types of taxable and non-taxable vehicles, especially with regard to retirement income. Investors who take current tax benefits by investing as much as possible in pre-tax accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s feel the pain of those benefits later by paying ordinary income tax on retirement distributions. While experts concur that tax uncertainty is the beginning of wisdom, the various strategies discussed in this article for implementing that wisdom clearly remain a matter of debate.","Grote, Jim, CFP", Cover Story,Dec,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Diversification , Tax rates , Tax planning , Risk management , Personal finance",ProQuest One Academic

Health: The Fifth Dimension of Family Wealth,"Health is the fundamental element of every individual's longevity, creativity, physical stamina, short-term mental acuity, long-term mental clarity, and overall quality of life. While traditional paradigms of family wealth planning focus on best practices for the preservation and transference of financial capital, innovative wealth advisors have begun to embrace a more comprehensive definition of family wealth -- one that includes the human, intellectual, and social capital of family members. Within this four-pillar model of wealth preservation, financial capital becomes the tool by which the other forms of capital are developed and expressed. But even within this broadened definition of wealth, one essential form of capital remains to be elucidated: health capital. As a trusted advisor, your role is to be a steward of your clients' assets and a resource for growing those assets. By considering health as an asset, you engage your clients in a transformational journey of discovery, the impact of which extends far beyond portfolio performance.","Pullen, Courtney;Wehner, Kristin", Commentary,Dec,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Health , Financial planners , Roles , Wealth management , Estate planning , Portfolio performance , Family trusts , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Beyond Monte Carlo Analysis: An Algorithmic Replacement for a Misunderstood Practice,"The application of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) in financial planning is a largely misunderstood technology that does not deliver the results as advertised. This paper identifies those misunderstandings and outlines a simpler, more accurate algorithmic approach. When MCS is used to return an overall probability of success or failure of a plan, it has not tested the impact of higher or lower returns, nor the impact of sequence risk such as the order of good or bad years of return and the timing of the client's goals. An algorithmic approach (Reliability Forecast) allows for the calculation of the same partial probabilities as generated with MCS, but provides other benefits. The Reliability Forecast simplifies the ability to generate a matrix illustrating multiple success factors -- not just a single success factor for a financial plan. It also separates the planning model from the probability distribution for randomized variables, easing the development effort.","Brayman, Shawn, BSc, MES", Feature,Dec,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Monte Carlo simulation , Probability , Belief & doubt , Financial planning , Financial statement forecasting , Algorithms , Success , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

But there is a two-pronged exception to both of these provisions: they do not apply if the property was transferred to the partnership in: 1. a bona fide sale, and 2. for full and adequate consideration.

Dynamic Allocation Strategies for Distribution Portfolios: Determining the Optimal Distribution Glide Path,"The purpose of this paper is to determine the optimal allocation strategy (referred to as the distribution glide path) for a portfolio subject to withdrawals. But unlike most previous research, which uses static allocations, the paper includes a dynamic allocation methodology. It also introduces a methodology to incorporate risk into the decision process. Despite the expected benefits of more sophisticated dynamic distribution allocation strategies, static equity allocations proved to be remarkably efficient. The paper introduces a risk-adjusted measure called the Success to Variability ratio in order to incorporate portfolio variability (standard deviation) into the optimal glide path decision process. When considering a variety of distribution periods and real withdrawal rates, as well as the probability of failure and the Success to Variability ratio, a balanced static allocation, such as 60% equity and 40% fixed income/cash, is likely one of the most efficient portfolio allocations for retirees.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA", Feature,Dec,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Standard deviation , Allocations , Probability , Retirement planning , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Detail is far more important for our peace of mind than it is for our clients' peace of mind.

Prudent Practices for Fiduciary Advisers Under the Pension Protection Act's Title VI,"The Pension Protection Act of 2006 encourages sponsors of qualified pension plans to augment general investment education with specific investment advice for plan participants. It does so by allowing plans to retain qualified fiduciary advisers and by establishing safe harbor procedures to insulate plan sponsors from the liability associated with the advice. This article, adapted from a new handbook, Prudent Practices for Fiduciary Advisers, examines what it means to be a fiduciary adviser under the new act, particularly as related to Section 601 (Title VI), and offers some of the best practices advisers should follow when delivering custom advice to plan participants. The fiduciary adviser must agree to provide personalized advice to plan participants and disclose all conflicts of interest, including sources of fees and compensation related to the plan and its investment options.

Kotlikoff, professor of economics, Boston University, and president, Economic Security Planning Inc, talked about where he sees financial advice going wrong and the advantage of a dynamic model. Conventional financial planning sets targets for people or, worse, has them set their own. This notion that people can set targets is promoting consumption disruption and is completely contradictory to what economics recommends. Conventional planning's use of spending targets also distorts its portfolio advice. Essentially, dynamic programming works by making general plans, starting with the household's last year of life and working backward to the present. Once you use this type of technology, you can figure out many things relating to living standard. The software can tell you what happens if you want to have another child, or what happens if you get divorced, or if you want to retire early and go fishing.","Lee, Shelley A", Interview,Nov,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Dynamic programming , Software , Economics , Planning , United States--US , Kotlikoff, Laurence J",ProQuest One Academic

With Apologies to Charles Dickens,"The simpler view of retirement planning for many people meant counting on a benefit from a company pension plan that had been earned over a work career that spanned 30-40 years with usually only one or two companies. That was then. Enter a more complex retirement reality that reflects the multi-dimensional qualities of the baby boomer's work and life experience in a new century. The changes are coming faster and with more intensity. Helping clients navigate those changes has created a revolution for financial planners as well. Financial planners have a unique role. They can influence, even help broaden, their clients' expectations about retirement. Planners can help clients develop and live a personally satisfying definition of retirement -- one that relates financial choices to meaningful life choices to create the best of lives.","Savage, Diane C, CFP, CRC", Commentary,Nov,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Roles , Opportunity , Retirement planning , Baby boomers , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Coming to Terms with Term Insurance,"Implementing term life insurance often needs more than just sorting through companies to find the least expensive one and then rushing out with the application. There are two reasons to use term insurance. One is because the need is temporary. The other reason to use term insurance is when the need is permanent but there is inadequate cash flow to spend on permanent insurance at the present time. The right to convert from term insurance to permanent without proof of insurability is very important, but judgment needs to be used in knowing if and when to convert. For clients in the economic stage of raising families and accumulating wealth, term insurance is the major type of life insurance to use, probably mixed in with some discounted whole life that is used for the dual purposes of family protection and tax-deferred cash value accumulation.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC", Commentary,Nov,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Insurance applications , Conversion , Term insurance , Insurance policies , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Spotlighting Common Methodological Biases in Active-Vs.-Passive Studies,"The debate over active versus passive investing is confounded by several issues that are not always recognized or dealt with properly. This article highlights the deficiencies common in studies on the benefits of active management, which include: 1. problematic survivor bias methodology, 2. counting funds rather than fund assets, 3. not accounting for multiple share classes, and 4. using a single index to represent passive index performance. This last issue is often referred to as index dependency. A recent article by Holmes (2007) dealing with the active-versus-passive debate contained several of these potential deficiencies, which likely influenced the results. Researchers find considerable variation in the percentage of actively managed funds that beat indexes based on what indexes are used as benchmarks. Moreover, there are material differences in the results when using asset-weighted performance data of actively managed funds rather than simply conducting a head count, and when properly accounting for funds with multiple share classes.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA;Israelsen, Craig L, PhD", Feature,Nov,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Comparative studies , Research methodology , Bias , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Inspiration and Service Critical to Planning Process,"All the planning in the world is impotent unless it is implemented. But implementation isn't just up to the client. Financial planners play a key role in whether a client follows through on a plan. If a client has participated in a dynamic financial planning experience, the natural result of that proven process leads them to implement in steps. Once clients have followed through on the planning ideas and know they are moving toward their goals, they will expect the service the planning process implies. The concept of service covers everything that happens after implementation. The Great service also triggers an ongoing discovery process about a client. As this happens, the perception of value increases and questions about fees and payments recede or are eliminated. The planning process that a client experiences leads to automatic implementation and the opportunity to provide excellent service based on trust and integrity.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP", Commentary,Nov,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Financial planners , Collaboration , Professional practice , Client relationships , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Third-Party Trusts: Tax Benefits and Asset Protection,"Third-party trusts serve as an effective tool for experienced estate planners and their clients. Third-party trusts are a useful alternative for clients who feel that neither the value of their assets nor their potential creditor exposure warrant creating a more comprehensive asset protection plan such as an offshore or domestic asset protection trust. A typical third-party trust involves one family member settling (creating) a trust for the benefit of another family member (primary beneficiary). A third-party trust will have two trustees that manage the assets -- an independent trustee and a family trustee. The primary beneficiary typically serves as the family trustee. A third-party trust can be designed to be either a domestic trust or a foreign trust. Foreign trusts afford stronger asset protection features. Even if a third-party trust is foreign for asset protection law purposes, it can still be designed as a domestic trust for income tax purposes.","Brown, Edward D, JD, LLM, CPA;Kaplan, Eric R, JD", Feature,Nov,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Third party administrators , Trustees , Estate planning , Trusts , Third party , Offshore , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Bridging the Property and Casualty Gap,"Due to certain dynamics in the property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance industry, as well as a reluctance by many Certified Financial Planner certificants to stray too far into the P&amp;C realm, the chances are high that many or even most of clients today lack adequate protection from both common and uncommon hazards, according to P&amp;C experts and financial planners who pay close attention to their clients' insurance needs. The most pressing risk management issues for the vast majority of clients, say planners and P&amp;C specialists, revolve around getting the right auto and homeowners policies in place. But the risk of under-insurance is probably far more likely to be the result of lack of attention to the issue by homeowners and their advisors than deceptive practices on the part of insurance carriers and brokers. Additional caveats and pointers on securing adequate homeowners insurance protection include: 1. appraisals, 2. contract language, 3.

Small-Business Tax Act Includes Incentives but Extends Kiddie Tax-Again,"With May 2007 came another tax law change. This time it was the Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act of 2007, which was signed into law on May 25, 2007. It is good news for many small businesses since it includes tax incentives. Some of these incentives include the ability to write off an even higher amount of equipment in the year of purchase and an extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. But to help offset the cost of the tax incentive provisions, the law again increases the age of children subject to the kiddie tax, which taxes children's unearned income of more than $1,700 at their parents' tax rate, generally resulting in higher tax.

Be Careful What You Wish For,"In theory, the federal court's elimination of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 202 -- the so-called Merrill Lynch Rule -- draws a clearer and brighter line between financial planners who choose the Registered Investment Advisor/fiduciary model and those who hold themselves out as doing ""real"" financial planning but who answer to a broker/dealer (either as independent contractor or as employee) and have not accepted fiduciary responsibility. But financial planners cannot afford to overlook the thousands of certified financial planner certificants who practice planning inside major firms. What many planners may be forgetting is that two large firms -- Merrill Lynch and IDS -- can stake a claim to pioneering financial planning. Mitch Farkas, managing partner, Princeton Financial Insights, and Tim Welsh, president and founder, Nexus Strategy LLC, both say that Merrill's planning effort was sophisticated, thorough, and used the accepted six-step process.

Achieving a State of Independence in Retirement,"Independence during retirement can mean many different things to different people. For most, it is an opportunity to pursue their passions. To properly advise their clients, financial advisors need to get a firm grip on clients' plans for enjoying their newfound freedom. To determine the best course of action for saving today, advisors need to understand what the client plans on accomplishing during each phase of life, especially in retirement. Typically, the first several hours of consultation are spent listening to determine a client's goals, hopes, and dreams for them and their family. Once they are able to determine the planned uses of a client's retirement nest egg, they then determine how large that nest egg needs to be and how to build it. Financial planners are in a position to help their clients achieve their own vision of independence. Although thorough and often painstaking discussions are needed to decipher their clients' visions, the results can be quite encouraging.","Supper, William J;Cocozza, Christopher R", Feature,Sep,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Independence , Client relationships , Retirement planning , Advisors , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Will DC Automatic Programs Eliminate Need for Education and Advice in the Workplace?,"American private workers increasingly rely on defined-contribution (DC) savings as the primary source of retirement income aside from Social Security. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) supports automatic enrollment and automatic escalation programs because the programs are likely to successfully circumvent participant inertia. David Wray, president of the Profit Sharing Council of America, predicts that the auto-enrollment programs, including all plans, will raise current participation levels from around 70% to over 83%. Despite advancements in DC-plan autoprogram success, plan sponsors acknowledge that they all have more work to do. To offer more effective educational assistance, employers may turn to benefit providers, their own professional staffs, or outside consultants. Connecting workers with competent financial planners via the workplace helps both employers and employees. Further, collaborating with employers to offer online education and tools to employees, as well as a database that enables employees to search for financial planners in their communities also benefits everyone.","Schaus, Stacy L", Feature,Sep,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Employers , Investment education , Employees , Defined contribution plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Variable Annuities: From Controversial to Mainstream Using a Two-Bucket Strategy, Part 2","This is the second of a two-part paper challenging conventional wisdom that suggests investors allocate their portfolio with lower-cost investment products that diversify unwanted stock market risk by allocating monies to fixed accounts and bonds. This article systematically back tests the alternative two-bucket strategy against the lower-cost traditional mutual fund strategy over every 30-year time horizon from 1926 through 2004. The results show that the two-bucket strategy with a variable annuity achieved an 18% higher average income and a 369% greater average inheritance with the assumptions tested. These findings might alleviate some of the negative stigma surrounding variable annuities based on previous controversial benefits that many financial advisors feel do not justify the extra costs. This research introduces an alternative strategy that investors and advisors can use to transfer stock market risk, potentially maximizing income and leaving a larger inheritance for one's beneficiaries.","Bernicke, Ty A", Feature,Sep,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Comparative analysis , Investment policy , Securities markets , Portfolio management , Variable annuities , Advisors , Inheritances , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Why Planning Fails: Four Key Obstacles and the Confidence Formula Solution,"Most seasoned planners have experienced clients who failed to implement a well-designed plan. This article examines why planning sometimes fails and how planners can reduce such failures. To follow through with a plan, the client, or wealth holder must have confidence in the planning. That requires four distinct elements: trust, clarity competence, and management. These four elements compose the Confidence Formula, an equation for creating positive planning results. The client must have sufficient clarity about what he or she is trying to achieve. They must be emotionally excited about their goals. That emotional clarity must be documented, and that documentation shared with the full advisory team. The client must be confident about the technical competence of the advisory team. Lack of management can undermine a plan. One advisor or firm must take complete ownership of the wealth holders ability to first achieve clarity and then achieve implementation and ongoing management of the result.","Fithian, Scott;Fithian, Todd", Feature,Sep,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Failure analysis , Financial planners , Wealth management , Confidence , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Planning Possibilities with Health Savings Accounts,"A working knowledge of recent tax updates provides some excellent prospects for both financial planners and the insurance industry regarding health savings accounts (HSAs). Internal Revenue Service rules for contributing to an HSA are more attractive and straightforward for the 2007 tax year. Changes have made them simpler to understand and have encouraged greater accessibility to clients in all phases of life. Planners need to maintain a comprehensive approach in working with their clients' health care needs. The integration of health savings accounts, tax savings, retirement savings, and high-deductible health care plans creates an exciting synergy in financial planning. HSAs are a tool that can help clients during the accumulation and retirement phases of their lives. This tool does have limitation. HSAs are not yet widely available, due in part to pre-2007 confusion concerning contribution rules.

Emphasizing Low-Correlated Assets: The Volatility of Correlation,"This study evaluates the volatility of correlation among 18 asset classes to each other to determine the consistency or inconsistency of relationships. It provides not only the long-term correlations of the assets, but the standard deviation of correlation and the range of correlations based on two standard deviations from the average correlation. It also summarizes the correlations in a probability distribution. In the asset allocation process, some assets often are used together even though diversification benefits have been very low. Several assets often are neglected in the asset allocation decision, even though their diversification benefits have been very high. Real estate, high-yield bonds, US bonds, and long-short are more closely linked to value investing than growth. The asset allocation decision should emphasize low-correlated assets that satisfy return objectives Two sample portfolios for different style investors show how risk and return are improved by combining lower-correlated assets.","Coaker, William J, II", Feature,Sep,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Correlation analysis , Asset allocation , Volatility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Paving the Way,"Change is on the horizon.

Second, there is the newly revised Standards of Professional Conduct from the board of directors of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards that will require a CFP professional to ""at all times place the interest of the client ahead of his or her own"" rather than practice according to the lower current standard of ""reasonable and prudent professional judgment."" For most consumers, however, trust -- the key component of a positive, long-term business relationship -- is not born of regulations or industry ethics.

Taking the Low Road,"The author received an e-mail from a client that he opened on a Saturday morning. That was a big mistake. This is a client whom the author likes a tremendous amount. He is a retired scientist, so he observes financial planning as if it were an experiment. So being the consummate financial planning professional, with almost 25 years of industry experience from which to draw, he immediately took the low road and responded to his client's e-mail. He finds it almost impossible not to be defensive. Even if the author's points in that e-mail were technically correct, he wrote it completely for his needs. And when he analyzes things even more closely, he can say that he must have felt some sense of guilt or shame that he counseled this client against buying an investment that subsequently doubled.

Using Decision Rules to Create Retirement Withdrawal Profiles,"This paper describes an approach where retirees define their desired retirement withdrawal profiles and then establish rules for retirement asset withdrawals to maximize total purchasing power. This approach allows retirees to control their retirement; they are no longer subject to one-size-fits-all withdrawal strategies or rules of thumb. The paper defines three primary retirement profiles. Under the uniform profile, withdrawals are steady throughout retirement; the progressive profile exhibits increased withdrawals in real dollars; and under the aggressive profile retirees make larger withdrawals early in retirement, followed by decreasing amounts. The paper illustrates all three profiles using a $1 million portfolio over a 40-year retirement period. After a retiree chooses the profile and the success rate that fits his or her retirement outlook, three decision rules can be applied to govern the amount withdrawn annually from investment assets and ideally boost the amounts safely withdrawn each year. Using decision rules dramatically increased the present value of the total withdrawals over scenarios with no decision rules, while still achieving a 99% success rate.","Klinger, William J", Feature,Aug,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Decision making , Withdrawals , Financial services , Retirees , Retirement planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Modern Portfolio Decumulation: A New Strategy for Managing Retirement Income,"This article outlines a strategy to improve the ability to obtain a stable and steady stream of distributions for life from a retirement portfolio and at the same time fund future wealth goals, such as for gifts and bequests. Typically planners suggest managing longevity risk either by annuitization or in the spending plan. This paper proposes an alternative method for managing it in the investment portfolio. Conventional approaches often fail to properly define the investment problem. To be effective, it is important to fully address longevity risk and use appropriate and complete measures of risk and risk aversion. For this problem, modern portfolio theory is an inadequate framework for portfolio construction. A new multiple-period, cash-flow-based investment framework is described that incorporates a dynamic asset allocation strategy and uses the cost of lifetime annuitization as a hurdle for managing longevity risk in the portfolio. By transforming longevity risk into investment risk and actively managing it in the investor's portfolio rather than the spending plan, this approach is particularly useful for investors with a strong desire to maintain a given standard of living.","Fullmer, Richard K", Feature,Aug,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Contributions , Risk management , Budgets , Investment policy , Retirement planning , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Does the Turnover of an Equity Mutual Fund Matter?,"It is often claimed that high rates of portfolio turnover erode the performance of an equity mutual fund. The explicit hypothesis behind this view is that high turnover creates more transactions costs and these costs act as a drag on fund performance. The implicit hypothesis is that portfolio turnover generates only costs and no alpha. The authors' view is that the relationship between turnover and portfolio performance is more nuanced than conventional wisdom would suggest. When these nuances are accounted for, turnover is not very effective when compared with other variables one might use to evaluate a fund to be held in a tax-deferred account. The authors' empirical work on this topic has five novel features. These are: 1. use of relative fund returns, 2. control for more variables, 3. nonlinearity, 4. dependence on category, and 5. dependence on skill. The results indicate that portfolio turnover is rarely a significant variable.","Peterson, James D;Riepe, Mark W", Feature,Aug,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Mutual funds , Turnover , Equity , Portfolio performance , Portfolio management , Hypotheses , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Private Foundations: A Great Idea or a Trap for the Unwary?,"Over the years, the author has learned to caution clients that the day-to-day operation of a private foundation involves threading their way through a maze of state and federal regulations. Experience suggests that the two biggest traps for your clients in the operation of private foundations are day-to-day governance and self-dealing. This article will examine both of these issues in hopes of providing a simple road map that will help your clients through the regulatory maze. The typical board of directors consists of Mom, Dad, and the adult kids. All too often, the family members who are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the foundation take a laissez faire attitude.

From Industry to Profession: Client Discovery Tools,"Not only is seeking professional advice and direction important, but the foundation for that advice must be built upon personal values. Values refer to qualities of life and that which gives meaning and purpose to life from the client's perspective. The wheels of the financial services industry are so well lubricated with product companies and broker/dealers delivering their products that it would be ludicrous to think that removing a product-centric focus could be forced on them. This has to happen as planners lead by example. This will transpire in several steps. The first step is for planners to hire their own financial planner and follow their advice. Second, individual advisors must behave and operate in a client-centric manner. Showing up as a client-centric advisor means you guide the client through the financial planning process in a way that is all about them and concentrates first on what is important to them in life.","Jones, Michael L", Feature,Aug,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Values , Financial planners , Financial planning , Client relationships , Financial services , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Expanding the Investment Mix Beyond Mutual Funds,"The range and versatility of portfolio management tools continues to increase beyond the standard fare of mutual funds. Several of these products, specifically separately managed accounts (SMAs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), have been gaining widespread acceptance. This article examines the different ways planners are using these accounts to boost clients' portfolios. Some use SMAs as the primary investment vehicle with large accounts, while others focus on specific investment strategies. Atlanta Financial Associates Inc works with approximately 200 households. The firm started converting clients to fee-based platforms in 2003, according to Julianne Andrews, CFP, a principal with the firm. From humble beginnings in 1990, ETFs have grown dramatically. Some began using them because they lacked alternative solutions. At Atlanta Financial Associates, Andrews started using ETFs as a small-cap placeholder in clients' portfolios because the mutual funds that her firm had selected for small-cap allocations were closed to new investors. Consequently, many planners routinely work with separate accounts and ETFs, and the shift toward those vehicles appears to be accelerating.","McCarthy, Ed", Feature,Aug,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Investment policy , Exchange traded funds , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Your diligence had better include an acceptable alternative. In cases like this, planners know they are correct when they say it is in the client's best interest. In his opinion, it is just too gray an area to push on when the client does not understand. In any relationship between planner and client, both parties should be benefiting.

Interviewing Prospects and 'Experiencing' the Planning Process,"While basic values such as honesty and trustworthiness are extremely important, you and your client should not have to agree on a number of other values. Whether you are giving a speech or are in discussion, clients will likely remember a story you tell rather than some quantitative point. Information from a client is subjective, objective, and subject to constant change because the client's life is a continuum of dynamic -- not static -- activity. The Everest of planning takes place when you are able to enlarge and change someone's comfort zone to include actions necessary to move them continually toward a successful financial life. To create positive chap in your clients' lives, you must help them broaden their comfort zone. To be effective, clients need to experience the planning process. It must intersect their lives in a creative and dynamic way.

Immigrants and Natives to Wealth: Understanding Clients Based on Their Wealth Origins,"The origin of clients' wealth leads to differences in their personal adjustment, parenting, attitudes, behavior how they want to pass on their wealth. Financial planners should be sensitive to the origins of clients' wealth in order to facilitate understanding, provide support, and guide choices about life planning and intergenerational communication. Those who acquire wealth such as through the development and sale of a business typically have a more fully formed sense of self before coming to wealth. Those native-born to wealth must develop their sense of identity out of a culture of affluence that is sometimes antithetical to that effort. Both immigrants and native-born worry about how to teach their children to handle wealth responsibly. Even more challenging to a financial planner is working with cross-class couples.

Even if companies actually have designed hedging formulas, such exotic strategies are notoriously inaccurate, the bust of subprime lending practices being the most recent example of how financial wizards are able to outsmart themselves. Insurance companies investigate most life insurance death claims that occur within the two-year contestable period to determine if there have been any material misrepresentations during the application process.

This study explains how an investor's stock management strategy affects the after-tax risk and returns on stocks held in taxable accounts.

The Role of Foreign Currency Investment in a Global Equity Portfolio,"This paper investigates the use of foreign currency as an investment asset in a diversified portfolio. The data consist of US equity returns, foreign equity returns, and six foreign currencies from 1975 to 2006. A portfolio optimization technique is applied using actual and simulated data to test the long-term portfolio implications of foreign currency investment. The results indicate that investment in foreign currency improves the Shape ratio and is a potential defensive asset given its low correlation with US equities. Theoretically, holding foreign currency over the long term is potentially beneficial to US investors. But to achieve the maximum benefit, US investors may have to unrealistically concentrate their funds exclusively in foreign equities, with a substantial investment in foreign currency. In a global equity portfolio containing 60%-80% US stocks, the incremental benefit of adding foreign currency provides a negligible improvement.","Ratner, Mitchell;Meric, Gulser;Meric, Ilhan", Feature,Jul,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Optimization techniques , International , Currency , Portfolio diversification , Foreign exchange , Investment policy , Equity",ProQuest One Academic

What You Call It Does Make a Difference,"Planners must carefully think about not only the words they use but also the personal meanings that each listener attaches to those words. For most planners, retirement planning is a rich phrase -- almost a form of financial planning shorthand. It encompasses a variety of elements: data gathering, personal goals, investment planning, lifetime income stream, long-term care, trusts, wills, powers of attorney, and modeling for the ""what if"" scenarios, among others. If savvy planners learn what retirement planning means for each client, they can uncover clues to a more effective, efficient, and satisfying approach when addressing the rather large universe of retirement planning needs. Perhaps an approach to helping people create their retirement dream is two-pronged: retirement planning and retirement preparation. Effective financial planners always guide clients to plan for all events, using both personal and financial resources.

When Should Women Claim Social Security Benefits?,"This paper summarizes the incentives facing older women when deciding when to claim their Social Security benefits. Nearly 60 percent of women opt for actuarially reduced benefits at age 62-a greater percentage than men. Yet women are expected to live longer than men. Longer life expectancy would generally suggest delaying Social Security benefits. But the analysis shows that single women and married women face very different choices. Married women are entitled to three types of benefits: (1) benefits based on their own earning records, (2) spouse's benefits based on their husband's earning records, or (3) survivor's benefit equal to 100 percent of their husband's benefits. These benefits are reduced if claimed earlier than the full retirement age. From the authors' study, two key points emerge. First, in the case of survivors' benefits, the husband usually can maximize the benefits of the couple or his surviving wife by delaying his claim. Second, the wife is usually better off claiming her own Social Security benefits as early as possible, though this can change depending what percentage her own benefits are of her husband's benefits. For most married women, the Social Security benefit structure actually encourages them to grab their benefits as soon as possible. While this may maximize the wife's Social Security ""wealth,"" it also encourages them to withdraw from the labor force, creating a loss of earnings and 401(k) savings, and extending the period over which they need to support themselves in retirement.

What's New? A Potpourri of Investment Research,"No one will be surprised that there were a number of articles discussing the advantages of active versus passive investing. Although the debate admittedly seems endless, the reality is that practitioners provide advice daily that, either consciously or unconsciously, reflects an opinion on this subject. Consequently, the author believes it is the responsibility of every practitioner to ensure that the philosophical basis of his or her investment advice is based on thoughtful and continuing research on the subject. The only investment subject getting as much or more coverage than active versus passive is asset allocation. Perhaps not as big a professional story as the prior subjects, ""life cycle"" investing is a popular story with the public media. As practitioners they spend a great deal of time and effort focused on the softer side of their clients' needs; however, they ultimately face the reality of implementation. In the complex world of modern finance, that is a daunting challenge.","Evensky, Harold", Feature,Jun,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Advantages , Mutual funds , Investment advisors , Asset allocation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Is Rebalancing a Portfolio During Retirement Necessary?,"This paper investigates the strategy of rebalancing the retirement portfolio during the withdrawal phase. The goal is to provide the largest number of equal (real) withdrawals from a given retirement portfolio. The study investigates six different allocations of stock and five different harvesting rules, only one of which rebalances the portfolio annually. The methods are tested using five different withdrawals rates (3-7 percent). The results look at shortfalls over 30 years, as well as shorter periods. The study uses two analysis methods: bootstrap and historical inflation-adjusted rates of return in their true temporal order. Both methods find that rebalancing provides no significant protection on portfolio longevity, and this holds for all withdrawal periods. In fact, in some cases, rebalancing increases the number of shortfalls. Withdrawing bonds first, over stocks, performs the best of all the methods, though the resulting stock-heavy portfolio may make some investors uneasy. This method also is most apt to leave a larger remaining balance at the end of 30 years, while rebalancing leaves the smallest amount. Withdrawing stocks first leaves more shortfalls than withdrawing low first or high first. Confirming previous research, the larger the proportion of stocks to bonds, the longer the portfolio lasts; the higher the withdrawal rate, the more shortfalls. The results suggest that the use of life-cycle funds or a life-cycle strategy that decreases stock proportions as one grows older needs empirical justification.

Advisors and Clients in the Brave New World of Philanthropy,"More and more donors are looking to their financial planners rather than to their favorite charities for advice on making serious gifts. According to a study of donors by the National Committee on Planned Giving, when donors were asked to identify the origin of the idea for their planned gift, they found that financial and legal advisors provided the impetus in 29% of the cases for charitable bequests and 68% for charitable remainder trusts, both up roughly five times the comparable 1992 results. The groundswell of giving in the US has fueled the demand for such advice. And the increasingly high-profile nature of philanthropy may be increasing the supply of donors through a kind of trickle-down generosity. Kathy Longo, CFP, a principal with Accredited Investors, a comprehensive financial planning firm in Minneapolis, MN, approaches philanthropy as part of her annual review process. Despite the conflicts of interest inherent in this altruistic field, she keeps her eye on the results of the intricate charitable planning process.","Grote, Jim", Cover Story,Jun,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Philanthropy , Financial planners , Polls & surveys , Charities , Celebrities , Advisors , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Caregivers as Unsung Heroes,"In the financial planning world, as well as the realms of politics and economic policy, looms the burning question on what will happen when all of the baby boomers retire. Family caregiving is not the same as professional caregiving, since people are talking about unpaid work. Author Beth Witrogen McLeod, a double-Pulitzer Prize nominee, has written extensively on the issue of caregiving. McLeod's experience reflects a growing reality. Most caregivers are women, many of whom juggle some combination of work, family, and marital demands at home, including child care, while trying to meet the needs of aging and impaired parents or other loved ones. According to McLeod, depression rates are higher, up to 76%, for intense caregivers supervising those with maladies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, or other forms of dementia, or neuropathic and peripheral nerve diseases. Caregiving issues will be an expanding and increasingly complex component of holistic planning.","Walker, Lewis J", Feature,Jun,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Caregivers , Financial planning , Mental depression , Baby boomers , Conferences , Dementia , Alzheimers disease , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Recent Health Care Developments Favor Taxpayers,"As health care and long-term care costs rise, the government continues to favor taxpayers with friendly legislation and rulings. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made a number of significant changes to the health savings account (HSA) rules starting in 2007. These changes make it more economically appealing and easier for employees to transition from traditional health care coverage to coverage through an HSA. In Private Letter Ruling 200704017, a professional firm chose to self-insure its partners and employees because of the high cost of medical insurance. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 provides a boost to cash value life insurance arrangements, annuities, and long-term care insurance. The three strategies discussed in this article allow a dual benefit from your premiums. HSA and self-insurance accumulations constitute savings that can be rolled forward for future expenses or reduce future contributions. Cash accumulations in life insurance and annuities can be distributed or used to buy long-term care insurance, if needed.","Gardner, Randy;Welch, Julie", Feature,Jun,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Health savings accounts , Tax legislation , Life insurance , Insurance coverage , Insurance premiums , Long term health care , Long term care insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Complete Client Satisfaction,"If you were to describe in simple terms what is important to the success of your advisory firm, most likely you would emphasize the value of serving your clients.

Using Three-Factor Theory to Assess Investment Performance,"In an effort to refine Sharpe's capital asset pricing model, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French advanced a three-factor model including risk premiums for size and value effects. In an effort to make this theory more accessible to practitioners, this article describes factor loading, expected return, and the determination of alpha that result from three-factor regression analysis. When exposure to the size and value premiums is considered, the returns of most active mutual fund managers are no greater than that which is predicted by the three-factor model. This would suggest that similar investment returns may be achieved through passive strategies with targeted exposure to the risk factors. Among all domestic equity funds, the occurrence of statistically significant alpha over trailing 10- and 15-year periods was extremely rare when measured against the three-factor model. The few funds that did outperform expectations have typically done so in isolated periods. Although the records of some mutual funds have appeared to be robust relative to existing benchmarks, they typically capture no more return than a passively managed portfolio with similar three-factor characteristics.

Serving the Underserved: The Middle Market Gap,"The first part of a series on different models for delivery of financial planning to underserved markets is presented. According to recent consumer research conducted by the Financial Planning Association, the demographic with the greatest demand for the services of a CFP professional is the 35-45 age group in the middle market/lower mass affluent socioeconomic category. Researchers at Cerulli Associates have published a model that explains much in the way of how financial advice is provided to the various consumer markets. In their model, technology-based support and intermediary-based support can be ""scaled"" to serve different segments of the audience. The less wealth the client has, the more technology can be used to streamline interaction. Meanwhile, Ameriprise planners have three key systems that allow them to offer a scalable model and facilitate the large-scale delivery of financial planning: customized financial planning software, a virtual back-office plan development center, and a browser-based client reporting system that provides clients with key measures in real time.","Walters, Sean R", Feature,May,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Models , Financial planning , Mass markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Who's the Fairest of Them All? A Comparative Analysis of Financial Advisor Compensation Models,"There are three primary modes by which investors pay for financial advice: commissions, asset-based fees, and flat fees. This paper examines the economic incentives at work in each and suggests that the debate over which model is ""fairest"" is flawed because all three models contain incentives that can lead to conflicts of interest and each may also represent an optimal choice for certain investor circumstances. The recent trend away from commissions in favor of fee-only planning may not represent a best-practice model for the profession. Alternatively the ideal compensation platform may be one that incorporates all three models. There is little evidence to suggest that regulatory differences lead fee-based advisors to be either more qualified or to act more ethically than commission-based advisors; however the fee-based models are clearly superior with respect to fiduciary disclosure requirements. It can be argued that regulatory inequality denigrates the commission models credibility.","Robinson, John H", Feature,May,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Models , Compensation , Incentives , Advisors , Fees & charges , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Planners and Coaches: A Natural Fit?,"For some financial planners, working with a coach for guidance on topics ranging from practice marketing to work/life balance is the solution when they need professional or personal advice.

Bedda D'Angelo, president of Fiduciary Solutions, believes a successful coaching relationship needs both comfort and challenge. The coach's expertise is another factor to consider. David Lesnick, founder of Sound Advice Financial Planning, wanted advice on growing his practice and sought that specific knowledge and experience in a coach.

Although the votes for the so-called broker/dealer rule, which exempts fee-based brokerage programs from the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, outnumber the ones opposed 6-2, the latter are the ones that matter. A fight in Congress appears imminent. There is no question that the Financial Planning Association is outgunned on Capitol Hill. But there have been other groups who share the same concern -- not only in the financial planning profession, but among consumer and state regulator associations.

Life-Cycle Investing Is Rolling Our Way,"Drawing on 1950s models, the financial planning community uses mainly precautionary savings and diversification strategies to manage personal wealth. But financial economists and many others in the financial services industry have moved on to a new paradigm known as life-cycle investing. Life-cycle investing is a multi-period model that uses hedging and insuring as well as precautionary saving and diversification as core strategies. Personal wealth is defined as the sum of current financial wealth and the present value of an investor's human capital-that is, what an investor's labor will earn during his or her lifetime. In contrast to the current paradigm, welfare is measured by lifetime consumption, not wealth. The combination of life-cycle investing theory and the great innovation in the derivatives markets since the 1970s has set the stage for a new generation of retail investment products. The new default 401(k) withdrawal may soon be an inflation-indexed annuity with a guaranteed floor and participation in market appreciation. Instead of talking about optimal portfolio withdrawal and rebalancing strategies, clients and their planners will focus more on how much and at what rate to annuitize financial wealth. At the moment, planners are uncomfortable with such widespread use of options and other derivative securities. But the implication for planners is that this paradigm shift in financial theory and product innovation is about to fundamentally change how we work with clients and how we structure our businesses.

The Passive Approach to Commodity Investing,"Investing in commodities is one potential avenue to improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio in the current environment of low bond yield and low equity-risk premium. The emergence of commodity exchange-traded funds has facilitated access to commodity markets while preserving the most advantageous features of passive commodity investing. The advantages of integrating a passive commodity investment in a portfolio include better diversification, better protection from inflation, and an interesting expected return. The article shows the risk-reduction benefits from introducing commodities into a traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolio. Passive commodity investing can earn positive returns due to an implicit ""insurance premium"" in the futures contract, to index rebalancing, and to the return of the T-bills used to fully collateralize the positions in futures. A study examines and verifies that these sources of returns materialized into actual returns from 1970 to 2006.","Plante, Jean-François;Roberge, Mathieu", Feature,May,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Bond portfolios , Commodities trading , Exchange traded funds , Investment policy , Commodities , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Automobile Insurance and the CFP Certificant,"Unless you made a transition to financial planning from a career in the property and casualty insurance business, you probably do not know much more about auto insurance than your clients do. When clients ask you a question about their property and casualty insurance, you probably beg off, suggesting that they review their policies with a competent P&amp;C agent. If you are really on top of your game, you may provide a stern admonition that they obtain an umbrella policy. With respect to collision and comprehensive, lien holder requirements must be honored, but planners should recommend judicious use of self-insurance. Although providing judicious advice about auto insurance does not directly generate fees or commissions for the planner, the benefits to the client are obvious. And the benefit to the planner is cementing a relationship that will generate not only other sources of income, but referrals as well.","Cordell, David M;Lemoine, Craig", Commentary,May,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Financial planning , Client relationships , Automobile insurance , Property & casualty insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Moving from Small-Business Owner to Secure Retiree,"One particular group that will need extensive retirement planning is small-business owners. Research shows that less than half of family businesses survive the second generation. This low survival rate suggests that passing the family-run business to the next generation will not have a positive long-term financial impact on the family's overall wealth. Therefore, it is always suggested that small-business owners explore all financial alternatives. When financial planners construct portfolios for retirees, one of our top priorities is achieving a diversified portfolio. If tax deferral is a client's key concern, then an installment sale may be the most effective course of action. To satisfy a client's wants and needs, an advisor needs to be fluent in the many different approaches and the potential advantages and disadvantages they create.","Supper, William J;Cocozza, Christopher R", Commentary,May,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Small business , Installment sales , Family owned businesses , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

New Comparability Plan: A New Paradigm in Retirement Planning for Small-Business Owners,"A profitable, closely held small-business owner not only may want to implement a qualified retirement plan for the business, but also contribute additional money on a pre-tax basis beyond the current annual elective deferral limits. And the owner may simultaneously want to minimize contributions to lower-paid employees. One answer is the new comparability plan. This plan is a form of cross-tested defined-contribution retirement plan that typically takes the form of a discretionary profit-sharing plan. This type of plan will successfully pass the nondiscrimination rules applicable to all tax-qualified plans as long as it satisfies one of two minimum ""gateway requirements,"" or provides a ""broadly available"" allocation rate to all employees or a ""gradual age or service schedule"" option. The plan works especially well where the owners of a small business are of different ages, but earn approximately the same amount of compensation, thus precluding an age-based plan.","Fevurly, Keith R", Feature,Apr,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Small business , Retirement plans , Closely held corporations , Defined contribution plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

They often have a new, inner sense of confidence, courage, and conviction to act on what they want to do and not wait and see what others will say or think.

At the close of the 20th century people learned that the brain ""remodels"" itself in a more efficient and powerful way as they get older.

National Savings Rate Guidelines for Individuals,"This study creates savings guidelines for typical individuals with different ages, income levels, and initial accumulated wealth so the public can more easily determine how much to save for retirement. It also creates benchmarks for how much capital an individual would have accumulated based on their income and age, with the presumption that they started saving at age 35. The study differs from previous savings studies in several important ways. Perhaps most key is that the savings guidelines and capital needs are calculated on retirement income as a percent of net pre-retirement income -- gross income minus annual ref retirement savings in pre-retirement. The study shows the urgency of starting to save no after than age 35. It also suggests that those whose income increases faster than inflation will have to save an increasing amount to ""catch up"" so as to be able to provide for the higher assumed standard of living in retirement.","Ibbotson, Roger;Xiong, James;Kreitler, Robert P;Kreitler, Charles F;Chen, Peng", Feature,Apr,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Monte Carlo simulation , Gross income , Savings plans , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Taking the QPRT Up a Notch,"A qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) provides an opportunity for significant gift tax and estate tax savings for taxpayers with substantial equity in their personal residences and vacation homes. Even greater savings are possible when the use of a QPRT is combined with fractional interest discounts and grantor trusts. A QPRT is an irrevocable trust to which the grantor transfers his or her personal residence or vacation home, or an interest therein. If the grantor survives the term of the trust, the QPRT terminates and the residence is either retained in further trust for or distributed outright to one or more third parties selected by the grantor. During the term of his or her retained right to live in the residence, the grantor will remain responsible for all repairs, mortgage payments, real property taxes, and other expenses. During the term of the grantor's retained interest, the grantor has the right to sell the residence and buy a replacement residence.","Gallo, Jon", Feature,Apr,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Residences , Fractional interests , Trust distributions , Grantor trusts , Estate taxes , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Rebalancing for Taxable Accounts,"While the rebalancing trigger determines the need for rebalancing, the rebalancing target defines what asset allocation mix will be implemented once the trigger has been activated. In a previous study, all the technique lined up close to linearly when plotted in risk-return space. There was no apparent advantage in terms of risk-adjusted returns from using a specific technique. Here are tips when rebalancing in a taxable account: 1. Exert more care when rebalancing in taxable accounts. 2. Avoid generating rebalancing trades by directing new money into underweighted asset classes. 3. When sensible, execute trades to generate tax losses that can then be used to offset any capital gains generated by rebalancing trades. 4 Be patient and wait until eligible for long-term capital gains treatment. 5.

Helping Clients Change: 21st Century Tools from a 19th Century Fable,"A fundamental tool in working with difficult clients is accepting that their past experiences affect their behavior in the present. A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, is a useful metaphor for helping clients understand this truth. In the story, Ebenezer Scrooge was not a miser by conscious choice; he was acting in accordance with hidden beliefs about money, or money scripts. Destructive financial behavior is not about money, but grows out of unfinished business from the past; the Ghost of Christmas Past helped Scrooge come to this realization. Integrated financial planning, which combines the emotional, or interior, aspects of finance with exterior financial knowledge, provides an expanded set of tools for working with these difficult clients. Acting as an effective change agent includes taking advantage of crisis points, establishing your credibility as an expert, building a relationship of trust with clients, being persistent, and following the lead of the client.","Kahler, Rick;Klontz, Ted;Klontz, Brad", Feature,Apr,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Behavior , Advantages , Client relationships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

New Insights into Advising Female Clients on Investment Decisions,"A large number of professional and academic studies have indicated that, in general, women are less knowledgeable, less risk tolerant, and less confident about their investment decisions than men are. This paper applies a model for change and suggests augmenting techniques for financial planners that can help women investors improve their investing behavior. The model is called the transtheoretical model of change, which only recently has been applied to financial behavior. Instead of trying to get adults to change their behavior instantaneously, the model takes a person through five successive stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The paper recommends techniques for planners to help their female clients successfully move from one stage to the next. A person may not successfully stay on course on the first attempt. Relapse and recycling during stages occur frequently.","Loibl, Cäzilia;Hira, Tahira K", Feature,Mar,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Women , Behavior , Models , Decision making , Financial planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Variable Annuities: Emerging from the Dark Side?,"According to the National Association for Variable Annuities (NAVA), total premium flow for variable annuities, or total sales, for the first nine months of 2006 was $116.9 billion, a 19.9% increase from the prior year's nine-month sales of $97.5 billion. A 2006 study by Financial Research Corp (FRC) suggests that advisors could add to that growth. Perhaps more than demographic changes, changes to the variable annuities themselves are responsible for driving product growth. And those changes can be summed up in two words: living benefits. Having long objected to variable annuities for all but very active traders because annuities convert capital gains to ordinary income, Peter Katt, CFP, LIC, of Katt &amp; Co, has a large issue with the new living-benefits guarantees. Accordingly, Katt advises planners to resist the emotional product pitches and evaluate variable annuities in the same rational manner they would analyze other products.","Opiela, Nancy", Cover Story,Mar,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Growth rate , Financial planners , Accelerated death benefits , Capital gains , Variable annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

A Phased-Income Approach to Retirement Withdrawals: A New Paradigm for a More Affluent Retirement,"Traditional withdrawal planning starts at the beginning of retirement by identifying a ""safe"" withdrawal rate. The phased-income approach discussed in this article takes a significantly different approach by starting its focus on risk-based issues at the end of retirement. It then works backward to create a wealth-distribution strategy that aligns retirees' income with their changing needs during retirement. This phased approach estimates and funds income beyond age 95 to minimize the risk of outliving assets. It also addresses risk-based needs for health care, long-term care (LTC), and legacies. On average, the process generated the following outcomes: 1. It generated initial income at age 65 that was nearly twice the traditional 4% solution. 2. It produced more cumulative income from age 65 to 95 than the traditional method. 3. It produced slightly less consumable income beyond age 95 than the traditional methods, but left income to help pay estimated health care and LTC premiums from 65 to 105, assuming 7% inflation.","Robinson, Charles D", Feature,Mar,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk , Withdrawals , Retirement planning , Retirement , Long term care insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Leveraging the Cassandra Factor in Retirement Planning,"While the myths recounting the tragic tale of the Greek heroine Cassandra vary, all agree that she was blessed with the gift of prophecy from the gods. But upon angering the gods, she was cursed so that her prophecies were not to be believed. When working with clients, retirement planners may find themselves in a situation similar to Cassandra's plight. Retirement planners face their own set of challenges in effectively communicating contingencies to their clients. Foreseeing the future for retirement planning clients may trigger strong reactions from them. To some clients, the words of the financial planner are as unbelievable as Cassandra's words were to the Greeks. For planners, leveraging the ""Cassandra factor"" would entail proposing to clients the advantage of a long-term care program that provides care in the home and maintains community connections as well as independence; this proposal is more consonant with the ""active lifestyle"" belief.","Savage, Diane C", Feature,Mar,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Long term health care , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Drifters and Huggers,"This article offers two reasons characteristic drifters perform better than index huggers. As what have been argued in an earlier study, there is a difference between an equity manager's style and resulting portfolio characteristics. To increase the chance of above-average returns, the authors believe a manager must be allowed to pursue a consistent style and allow portfolio size and value/growth characteristics to drift over time. The authors present the results from studies and propose two reasons drifters perform better: 1. Drifters perform better because restricting a manager to a single characteristic box makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue an equity style. 2. Drifters perform better because they are free to take advantage of strong characteristic reversal effects in stock returns. Rather than being criticized or forbidden, characteristic drift should be encouraged.","Callahan, Craig T;Howard, C Thomas", Feature,Mar,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Differences , Management styles , Equity , Portfolio management , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Retirements 'At Risk': New Index Measures Retirement Preparedness,"Americans weaned on post-war affluence have come to expect an extended period of leisure at the end of their work life. And, indeed, the majority of today's retirees are able to afford a decent retirement. But this group is living in a ""golden age"" that will fade as baby boomers and Generation Xers reach traditional ages in the coming decades. Because many Americans appear unaware of disquieting trends, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has developed the National Retirement Risk Index (NRRI). The NRRI measures the share of working-age households who are at risk of being unable to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living in retirement. The NRRI assumes that three types of wealth are annuitized at retirement: financial assets, 401(k) balances, and money received from a reverse mortgage on the household's primary residence.","Munnell, Alicia H;Eschtruth, Andrew D", Feature,Mar,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Risk , Standard of living , Indexes , Reverse mortgages , Retirement planning , Baby boomers , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

SEC's RAND Study: Trojan Horse for the Brokerage Industry?,"Last September, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tapped the RAND Center for Corporate Ethics, Law and Governance to conduct an 18-month study of the ongoing confusion between broker and adviser regulation when both provide the same service. This study came about as a byproduct of the so-called ""Rule 202,"" or exemption approved by the SEC in response to the SEC's decision to allow brokers to offer fee-based advisory services without registering under the 1940 Advisers Act. If done right, the RAND study should be able to document current industry marketing practices as it interviews industry representatives, collects marketing materials, and conducts more investor focus group interviews. The silence these days from official SEC channels over NASD oversight, one might say, is deafening. Not that there is complete silence.

Psychology and Life Planning,"Because of the depth of mutual trust, the sense of intimacy, and the encouragement of positive life changes that occur in the life planning relationship, many planners express concern that such an approach implies that they would somehow be taking on the role or functions of a psychotherapist. This article, adapted from the recently published book, Lighting the Torch: The Kinder Method of Life Planning, addresses those concerns. Planners need to ""prepare the container"" for life planning by establishing boundaries, such as deciding whether to work with relatives and friends or socialize with clients. Some clients or prospective clients may not be ready for life planning until they work with outside therapists on such deep-seated issues as alcoholism or gambling. Issues where planners are more likely to draw on the wisdom of the therapy profession include working with resistance and recognizing ""projections"" by either you or the client.","Kinder, George;Galvan, Susan", Feature,Mar,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Psychology , Financial planners , Socialization , Client relationships , Retirement planning , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

A New Recipe for Life Insurance Valuation,"In Aug 2005 the Treasury issued final regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 402(a) that define how to value a life insurance policy when it is distributed from a qualified retirement plan. Correctly applying these regulations provides taxpayers with a safe-harbor value that will be acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service. The problem is that valuations performed under the safe harbor of these regulations are quite punitive and in many instances do not reflect a policy's fair market value. The account value dramatically overstates a policy's intrinsic value but these new regs severely limit factoring in the interplay of surrender charges, and this is why they often overstate a policy's market value. Significantly, the new regulations do not take into account the insured's health or other factors. This can mean that the safe-harbor valuation will be lower, and sometimes much lower than what people would consider the more accurate market value.","Katt, Peter C", Feature,Mar,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Insurance policies , Safe harbor , Valuation , Fair market value , Life insurance , Internal Revenue Code , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Recent Developments Help Avoid the Double Tax on IRD Property,"One of the most frequently encountered and least understood income tax/estate planning problems is the heavy tax burden imposed on income in respect of decedent (IRD) property. Planners need to plan carefully with IRD assets, watching for opportunities to avoid the estate tax and reduce the marginal income tax rate. Here are some planning strategies: 1. Identify who is going to pay the estate tax. 2. Do not forget to claim the income tax deduction for the estate taxes paid. 3. If possible, defer the payment of income tax on the IRD by postponing the receipt of IRD income. 4, If the decedent has a marginal income tax rate lower than the beneficiaries, execute a Roth conversion or distribute the IRD asset to the decedent before death. 5. Avoid estate tax by transferring the IRD asset to the surviving spouse. 6. Avoid estate tax by transferring the IRD asset to charity.","Gardner, Randy;Welch, Julie A", Feature,Feb,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Guidelines , Tax rates , Effective income tax rates , Income in respect of a decedent , Estate taxes , Income taxes , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Bank Loan Funds: Investing Beyond T-Bills,"Some risk-averse investors may want a majority of their wealth in non-equity holdings such as Treasury bills, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds. But returns from these can be anemic. An alternative is an asset class known as bank loans or senior loans. Bank loans are a multi-class hybrid asset. They are the short-term equivalent of high-yield bonds but with important differences. Using standard Markowitz portfolio theory, this article studies the return/risk impact of allocating bank loan funds into a predominately bond portfolio. The study assumes an investor initially invested 100% in T-bills, with bank loan funds and other assets added to the mix for return requirements ranging from 5%-10%. As return requirements rise, bank loan allocations rise, and standard deviations fall, until allocations begin falling significantly above 8% return requirements, giving way to equities.

A growing trend, the triumph of meaning over money, is spurred by the demographic wave. Many planners now accept the idea that to minimize the odds of running out of money before death, a maximum 5% withdrawal rate from a portfolio is de rigueur; that means for every $50,000 a year in post-retirement cash flow desired independent of Social Security or pension income, a portfolio of $1 million is required. As advisors move from a process of needs identification to the deeper realm of needs fulfillment, the role of teacher will add to the value proposition.

Semivariance in Asset Allocations: Longer Horizons Can Handle Riskier Holdings,"The investment horizon of investors is critical in establishing proper asset allocations. This article uses semivariance and standard deviation as risk measures in determining the historically optimal allocations to a bond index or a small stock-index with a large-stock index over investment horizons of 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. The most surprising finding is that the reward-for-semivariance results consistently indicate a higher allocation to the riskier assets than the reward-for-standard deviation assessments indicate, except for similar allocations by the two metrics for the large stock and corporate bond portfolios at a 20-year horizon. Over longer investment horizons, greater allocations to the riskier asset appear to provide the best return for risk. This result is consistent when using either semivariance or standard deviation as the risk measure. The results support the common advice of greater allocations to riskier assets for long-horizon investing. Long-term asset allocations based on short-term reward-to-risk assessments could lead to an overweighing on low-risk assets and reduce ending portfolio values.","Beach, Steven L", Feature,Jan,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Studies , Variance analysis , Asset allocation , Bond portfolios , Investment policy , Risk assessment , Standard deviation , Investments , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Improved Study Finds Index Management Usually Outperforms Active Management,"This study seeks to improve in several ways upon previous studies examining the relative performance of index management versus active management. It concludes that index management outperforms active management in most asset classes. To make comparisons between index management and active management as accurate as possible, the study segregated funds by style and then compared funds of the same style. This ""apples to apples"" comparison is the most accurate methodology. Many studies on indexing versus active management have used only gross returns, which tend to overstate active manager fund performance. By contrast, this study examines fund performance net of management fees, expenses, and the impact of taxes. Also, these studies typically have used commercial mutual fund databases as their investment universe.

FAILURE TO LAUNCH: Missed Opportunities in Education Planning,"While 529 plans have been touted as the magic slipper for education woes, experienced education planners argue that a one-size-fits-all product is not necessarily adequate for clients planning for their children's college education -- especially for clients who have left planning to the last minute. Education planning is much more than investment planning. Parents need a financial advisor who understands the landscape of higher education. Few planners will have clients who qualify for need-based financial aid. The secret to all college planning is the use of other people's money. The purpose of college is not to save money but to learn and ultimately to develop a lifelong love of learning. A practice devoted to education planning is ripe for the taking because the financial industry has overlooked education funding for years. The goal for planners should be the ability to approach families facing the high costs of college with the tools to reduce the overall cost of college, thereby creating more funds tot their retirement.","Grote, Jim", Cover Story,Jan,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Higher education , Financial planning , Education expenses , Client relationships , Planning , Education , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Death of Life?,"Forty years ago a professor named Richard Farmer warned in the Journal of Risk and Insurance of an imminent crisis in the life insurance industry due to managerial arrogance and resistance to innovation (Farmer 1966). The bad news is that Professor Farmer's predictions may yet come true. For commission-based financial planners selling cash-value life insurance products, and even for planners helping clients decide whether to buy a cash-value insurance product, the implications are critical. In the first few years of this century, cash value policies faced a perfect storm of competition, a worrisome stock market, and negative publicity. In this information age, cash value life insurance has been forced to become more transparent. Popular finance magazines, newspaper columns, and Web sites have focused on costs and fees associated with cash value life insurance. Greater scrutiny of cash value products places greater emphasis on the importance of due diligence by the planner.","Cordell, David M;Finke, Michael;Lemoine, Craig", Feature,Jan,2007,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planners , Business conditions , Client relationships , Life insurance , Investment policy , Insurance industry , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Five Steps for Creating Effective Processes,"Creating documented processes for your firm isn't always the most fun or exciting task, but the impact of doing so is compounding. It's important to note that creating documented processes isn't something you do just once; rather it's something that once completed has to be updated on a regular basis to reflect any changes and reap the benefits of having processes in place. The benefits of creating documented processes include continuity, growth, efficiency, consistency, and confidence.

"How to Effectively Manage Six ""Oh Bleep"" Client Situations","Managing difficult client situations is part of every financial adviser's job description. Most are adept at handling client questions and concerns about market-related events like a drop in the S&amp;P 500 or a spike in interest rates. They are also proficient at handling common and mostly ""happy"" life occurrences like a child being admitted to an expensive college or a spouse unexpectedly inheriting a large sum of money. But what about helping a client through one of the many not-so-happy life events that inevitably occur, especially with older adults? These kinds of ""oh bleep"" moments, like a client suddenly coming down with a serious long-term illness, can be challenging to successfully navigate. These situations not only constitute a significant financial risk to a client, but they can also produce strong feelings and emotions. Clients may express anxiety over a recent plunge in the NASDAQ, but such responses usually pale in comparison to their reaction to a diagnosis of lung cancer or the death of a spouse. Here, Heye looks at six ""oh bleep"" client moments, and the steps that advisers can take to successfully manage and mitigate both the financial and emotional aspects of the situation.","Heye, Chris, PhD", Journal Article,May,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Interest rates , Financial management , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic
Inflation Uncertainty Calls for Portfolio Protection,"Inflation currently sits at 7.9 percent, having soared to heights not seen since the early 1980s on the heels of loose monetary policy, logistical logjams, a global pandemic, and geopolitical crisis in Europe. After 20 years of relatively moderate inflation averaging 2.0 percent, this critical investment risk is emerging as a top priority for investors. As inflation continued to surprise to the upside throughout 2021, this deviation from the longer-term trend left many market participants perplexed. At the start of 2022, the inflation outlook suggested a retreat in the second half of the year. Instead, months later, a geopolitical crisis now unfolds on Europe's eastern front, further intensifying inflationary concerns, and investors are reminded of the importance to protect investment portfolios against unexpected inflation. For investors, the continued uncertainty can feel crushing as they look to their portfolios to fund their lifestyle and near-term financial goals. This presents an opportunity for advisers to reassess portfolios to ensure they are properly protected. Yet effective inflation mitigation remains not just crucial for advisers, but also challenging to identify and implement. Advisers construct portfolios to balance the tradeoffs between risk and return, but this well-documented relationship is far from straightforward.","Marotta, Ryann, CFP®, CFA", Journal Article,May,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Investors , Investments , Pandemics , Monetary policy , Inflation , Financial planners , Geopolitics , Europe",ProQuest One Academic

Financial Planners' Gray Divorce Checklist,"Divorce today is less common for adults younger than 50. However, ""gray divorces"" are on the rise. An analysis of American Community Survey data, conducted by Pew Research Center, shows divorces involving couples 50 and older have increased by 50 percent since the 1990s. The divorce rate among couples ages 65 and older has more than tripled. The hardest group hit? Those divorcing from a second or third marriage. Financial planners are needed more than ever to assist individuals with the multitude of questions and decisions an individual either close to or already in retirement must consider when going through a late-life divorce. Divorces at a more advanced age are much different from those for an individual who is 35 years old with two young children. Experienced financial planners play a crucial part in this level of divorce. As someone who understands tax laws, you can evaluate what the property and asset settlement may look like not just based on total dollars but based on single-taxpayer status and income.","Stephenson, Angie M, CFP®, CPA/PFS", Journal Article,May,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Divorce , Marital separation , Marriage , Tax legislation , Retirement , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

What's Happening to Withdrawal Rates,"Withdrawal rates have been much in the retirement planning news during the pandemic. What's safe, what's not, and what won't be any more have all been popular topics. Here, Guyton shares a few observations based on what he sees (and doesn't see) in recent research and what he shares with clients when they ask. First, most retires have more money than several years ago. This is a big deal! In fact, they probably have a lot more money if their plans were centered on evidence-based withdrawal strategies and portfolio construction. Importantly, they also have more than might have been previously projected or predicted. Good financial planners know that withdrawal rates (the percentages) fluctuate even if inflation-adjusted withdrawal amounts (the ""real"" dollars) do not. After periods of poor equity returns, withdrawal rates rise. The opposite is true after periods of strong equity returns. This is Retirement Income Planning 101. The key is that, due to this rise in portfolio values, current withdrawal rates for most retirees are significantly lower than a few years ago.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®", Commentary,May,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Pandemics , Withdrawals , Inflation , Retirement planning , Retirement income , Retirement , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Further, in the fixed income world today, there are two significant challenges: one secular (10 years or longer), the other cyclical.

Though these programs are vital, they come with considerable restrictions and are vulnerable to cuts due to political disposition. Another level of financial security is available, but it takes work and careful planning to obtain these often-overlooked benefits--Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare. While Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) both are federal programs that provide financial assistance to people with disabilities, they differ greatly. SSDI is an entitlement, which guarantees benefits to those who qualify based on their disabilities. SSI is means tested and helps those with little or no income with basic needs like food and shelter. SSI comes with strict eligibility requirements regarding income, assets, and living arrangements, making it difficult for many to qualify and easy for recipients to lose benefits if their circumstances change.","Felten, Elisabeth, CPA", Journal Article,May,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Medicaid , Disability insurance , PSYCHOLOGY , PSYCHOLOGY",ProQuest One Academic

Real Estate Rentals and The Self-Employment Tax,"Many clients are escaping the volatility of the securities markets by investing in alternative investments such as real estate. They avoid the cost of property managers by marketing single-family homes and separate living units in their own homes on Airbnb and Vrbo. For clients using these approaches with their rentals, the IRS Chief Counsel's office recently issued Chief Counsel Advice (CCA) 202151005 providing guidance concerning rental income and the self-employment tax. CCAs do not carry the same weight as the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, and court decisions as they do not have precedential value but, similar to a private letter ruling, they do reflect the IRS's perspective on a given issue. The CCA addressed two issues. First, the IRS examined whether the characterization of an activity as a ""rental activity"" under the passive loss rules determines whether the activity is ""rentals from real estate"" excluded from net earnings from self-employment for self-employment tax purposes. Second, the IRS explored when, in situations not involving a real estate dealer, rentals of living quarters are considered ""rentals from real estate"" excluded from the self-employment tax.","Gardner, Randy, JD LLM CFP®, CPA, RLP, AEP", Journal Article,May,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Investment , Real estate , Single family , Self employment , Securities markets , Volatility , Rentals , State court decisions",ProQuest One Academic

You can teach a new hire the needed skills. You can't change their personality. Most companies start off with a short list of candidates that they whittle down. That already is the first mistake.

Distribution of Inherited IRAs Subject to 10-Year Rule,"One of the prominent new rules under 2020s SECURE Act is that inherited IRAs for ""non-eligible"" beneficiaries must be distributed by the end of the 10th year after the decedent's passing (spouses who inherit IRAs are not subject to this 10-year rule). Previously, these beneficiaries were allowed to stretch distributions over their lifetimes, which also delayed income taxes due on those distributions. Beneficiaries who inherited IRAs since the beginning of 2020 should carefully consider the timing of distributions. Thoughtful analysis of this question can potentially avoid significant taxes. This is an opportunity for financial planners to add value for clients who have inherited an IRA since the beginning of 2020.

Below are three questions per each criterion to help you evaluate the likelihood of succeeding in a current succession plan, or identify when saying ""no"" to a succession plan could actually be the right decision. Open communication is the first foundational area to assess when working toward a succession plan.

Does Advisor Channel Influence Passive Fund Choice?,"* Historical differences in compensation may influence how representatives from brokerdealers, registered investment advisers, and dual registrants select funds. * Evidence from advertising content suggests that active-fund families promote characteristics such as recent returns that are appealing to investors and reward commission-compensated advisors, but do not predict future performance. * Using a survey that asks advisors to list the top three criteria they use when selecting mutual funds for a clients and their investment style, we find that registered representatives (from RIAs) favor more salient characteristics such as expense ratio while representatives from brokerdealers and dual registrants favor recent returns and active investing strategies. Registered representatives from RIAs are more likely to follow a passive investing strategy and consider expense ratio as an important fund characteristic, while there is no statistical difference between representatives from brokerdealers and dual registrants. These findings are consistent with the existence of conflicts that favor the promotion of active investing strategies among advisors who are regulated as fiduciaries.","Finke, Michael;Szapiro, Aron;Blanchett, David M, PhD CFP® CFA", Commentary,Apr,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Brokers , Mutual funds , Investment advisors , Exchange traded funds , Asset management , Financial planners , Advisors",ProQuest One Academic

The Formula for Finding the Right Fit for Your Team,"You meet a candidate for a position in your firm and absolutely love them. You forgo a deliberate screening process and bring them on as quickly as possible. A few weeks later, you find out they're not a good fit for your team. Now what? You don't want to embark on a new search, so you let your stakeholder stay until they decide to leave. By that time, you've already spent a tremendous amount of time with someone who wasn't working out. Now you need to cover the cost of finding and training their replacement. And who's to say what damage this has done to the rest of the team? People all heard the old adage, ""Hire slow and fire fast."" Unfortunately, they don't do this often enough, and it becomes a barrier to building the optimal team. Here, Herbison addresses a few of these mistakes, gives few fixes, and offers a formula to find the right fit for your organization.","Herbison, Gerry, DBA, CFP ChHFC, CASL, CLF", Commentary,Mar,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Hiring , Terminations , Training",ProQuest One Academic
How Fintech Is Enabling More Customized Investing,"Henry Ford famously said, ""Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants, so long as it is black."" That mindset works well at the onset of a venture. When you need to ramp up production, it's best to have a one-size-fits-all approach, so you can create efficient assembly lines or lower client costs and stay in business. But after a while, people are going to want their custom products, and investors are hungry for that now. Ford, Nissan, Tesla, and pretty much every car manufacturer is now offering customization. Many other industries are moving in this direction, too. Some firms might stand by the sanctity of how they have created their product offerings, but customers who do want customization might not return. It's still a good idea to offer simple, affordable solutions, but don't exclude the potential clients who are going to look elsewhere if you refuse to cater to them. By creating or implementing platforms that allow your clients to create the direct index that truly represents what they stand for and that will deeply benefit them, you will find yourself positioned to bring in those clients with specific investing goals.","Cummings, Bridger;Andrus, Danielle", Editorial,Mar,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Customization , Customer services , Product design",ProQuest One Academic

Estate Planning Insights for Business Executives and Owners,"Business executives and owners often have complicated estate planning needs that evolve over the course of their professional careers and into retirement. You may financially plan for corporate executives and business owners, as you do for many clients, to allow for the maximum lifetime use of their assets, while simultaneously developing an estate plan that optimizes the value and protects the ultimate distribution of wealth to their spouses, children, and other assigned beneficiaries. Executive compensation differs from other forms of compensation. Accordingly, there are details to identify for business executives and owners that you likely do not need to review in formulating an estate plan for other clients. Their overall assets are more likely to be concentrated in private equity, stock options, and restricted stocks. This reduced liquidity and concentration of investments in employer's stock potentially gives rise to special estate planning and administration issues for executives and owners, as well as for their beneficiaries and fiduciaries.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP® CTFA AEP", Commentary,Mar,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Wealth distribution , Stock options , Private equity , Executive compensation , Estate planning , Liquidity , Executives",ProQuest One Academic
Operationalizing Growth: How to Work 'On Your Business',"Being a service-based business owner is a unique challenge. Most advisers get into the business of firm ownership because they are passionate about financial planning and serving their clients well. Marketing, accounting, setting growth goals, HR, and all of the other ""hats"" they have to wear become exhausting with time. As a result, firm owners end up focusing almost exclusively on working in their business. They build a strong book of business, continue their education to hone their skill set, and nurture strong client relationships. These elements of a service-based business are foundational! However, if firm owners only focus on the services they offer, their business will suffer in the long run. Working on your business is just as important as working in it, if not more so.

The Wild Digital West,"About 88 percent of Americans are now using some sort of fintech solution, according to Plaid. Some of that is very straightforward--online banking, money transfers, etc. But an elusive enigma that still is cloudy in many a mind are blockchains and cryptocurrency. Even if one doesn't personally touch cryptocurrencies, only the most ardent of ostriches with a head in the sand would not have at least heard about Bitcoin: a novel concept of a decentralized currency that slowly accrues more of said currency via computers cracking increasingly difficult equations. This information is then stored on every user's computer, with each account crosschecking all other accounts to ensure that the books are kept in order by repeating the information of who has how much. It seems like it's all out of control, and Cummings wouldn't argue. Some countries are embracing cryptocurrencies, and El Salvador even made Bitcoin an official currency.

The vision of artificial intelligence in the 1980s hasn't played out (yet?), and today, ""Skynet"" is a sarcastic shorthand for unexamined fears about the technology. However, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies are quietly working behind the scenes to make lives, and financial planning, easier. Despite all the ways that fintech helps planners serve their clients, connections between people are at the heart of what financial planners do. Advisers provide more than retirement planning or investment management for their clients; they provide reassurance that the decisions they're making today will help them attain the future they want.

Four Ways Longevity Impacts Women's Retirement,"Much as financial planners try to quantify the future, retirement planning is far from an exact science. It would be much easier if they knew how long their clients were going to live, how they were going to die, and how the markets and tax laws were going to change over the years. But the fact is they can't foresee what the future will hold with accuracy. All they can do is their best. They know what their job is--which is to help their clients accumulate enough money to get to the point when they can retire in comfort, which means something different to each person. They also need to guide them through their retirement years to make sure their money lasts as long as they do so that they can leave something for their heirs. Although advisers are aware of the impact of longevity on retirees, surprisingly enough, 43 percent of retirees and 38 percent of pre-retirees underestimate life expectancy by at least five years, according to a 2021 survey from the Society of Actuaries.","Armstrong, Alexandra, CFP® CRPC", Commentary,Mar,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Heirs , Retirees , Retirement planning , Retirement , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic
"Retirement Glide Path Options in an Uncertain, Low-Interest-Rate Environment","* Some retiree asset allocation decisions may be based on projections made using long-term historical average returns of the different asset categories. With stock and bond returns at their long-term averages, a 4 percent initial withdrawal rate over a 30-year retirement was a possibility even for conservative investors with portfolios heavily weighted toward bonds. This pleasant picture changes dramatically when the current bond environment is considered. * After spending much of 2020 below 1 percent, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have increased to about 1.6 percent as of May 2021, still far below their long-term average. With inflation averaging 2 percent and possibly headed higher, bonds are providing negative real returns for retirees in need of safe cash flows. In addition, if bond yields do climb back up to their long-term averages, retirees holding bonds will be hit with significant capital losses along the way. * Rather than assuming that bond rates and inflation will return to normal over five or 10 years, as some other papers have done, this analysis considered scenarios where rates return to normal over five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years, or never. While a quick recovery for interest rates would mean large upfront capital losses for new retirees, failure rates for portfolios heavily weighted with bonds peak if rates recover in about 15 years. This study found that post-retirement glide path choices that would have worked in the past are no longer safe investment choices in this environment. With a 20-80 stock-bond mix, a 4 percent withdrawal rate over 30 years is simply not a viable option. Even with lower withdrawal rates and/or shorter retirement horizons, retirees are best served with decreasing glide paths that boost their early allocation to stock. Decreasing glide path options result in lower failure rates across the different portfolio equity levels, but the higher the allocation to stock, the less the choice of glide path matters.","Waggle, Doug, PhD;Moon, Gisung, PhD;Lee, Hongbok, PhD", Journal Article,Mar,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Investors , Stocks , Bonds , Interest rates , Capital losses , Retirement planning , Retirement , Retirees",ProQuest One Academic

Harnessing Cognitive Biases for Client Benefit,"Many biases share common roots and ultimately arise from a central evolutionary skill set: the ability to react quickly and intuitively. Before agriculture and tools, human survival centered on immediate activities. You seized any opportunity for food, water, safety, and satisfaction. Those who responded to threats intuitively and quickly were more likely to survive. Although human experience has changed drastically, our brains are still wired this way. We hotly pursue what looks and feels appealing. Conversely, we avoid things that look bad, feel bad, sound bad, smell bad, and taste bad. This highly evolved visceral intuition is a key source of today's cognitive biases. It still serves to evade immediate threats, but woefully underprepares us for risks that might not present themselves in two years, 10 years, or 30 years.

A Lasting Legacy of the Great Recession: How Changes in Wealth Were Associated with Changes in Bequest Expectations,"* Between 2007 and 2009, American aggregate household wealth declined by 20 percent (Dettling, Hsu, and Llanes 2018). By 2012, however, aggregate household wealth surpassed its 2007 peak and continued to increase through 2016. Although the Great Recession and its subsequent recovery has been extensively studied, little is known about the association between changes in wealth during these periods and changes in bequest expectations. · Based on Hurd and Smith's (2001) model of consumption and saving, we expected a positive relationship between changes in wealth and changes in bequest expectations. The purpose of this study was, however, to explore whether a modest or significant decline in wealth that occurred during the Great Recession was linked with a drop in bequest expectations. Similarly, this study investigated the magnitude of wealth increases during the recovery that were associated with a return to expectations held prior to the Great Recession. · Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), this research found that during the Great Recession, both significant and modest declines in wealth were associated with a drop in bequest expectations. However, no relationship was found between increases in wealth and a rise in bequest expectations. Following the Great Recession, only wealth increases at the highest end of the distribution were associated with a return to previously held bequest expectations. · Financial planners can use these results to better understand shifts in bequest expectations during various economic cycles and provide the necessary interventions to help clients meet their long-term wealth transfer goals and objectives.","Sommer, Matthew, Ph D, CFP®, CFA;Lim, HanNa, Ph D, CFP®", Journal Article,Feb,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Great Recession , Bequests , Wealth , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Can TCFD Solve the Tragedy of the Commons?,"The tragedy of the commons is a concept in economics where people put individual gain ahead of societal welfare (usually due to lack of rules or laws), leading to worse outcomes for everyone.

A lot of things, like piracy, are still banned by international treaty, but overfishing has not been properly addressed. This has led to some fishers overfishing and depleting stock of some fish to dangerously low levels. If the trend continues, extinction for some species might be seen within our lifetimes.

Why Financial Planners Should Embrace a Subscription-based Model,"Persuading people to hire a financial adviser is in many ways only getting more challenging. So much advice is available free online, and easily accessible consumer tools such as trading apps and robo-advisers have added to the difficulties. In fact, even social media is impacting financial decisions, with TikTok becoming one of the most sought-after online applications for financial advice with millions of videos accessible to users of all ages. Financial advice, advisers know, isn't about just stocks and bonds. Yet, the way many advisers charge for their services--assets under management--reinforces that misperception. That fee approach also can deter potential clients, who may be seeking advice in other areas, such as retirement planning or guidance on a real estate investment, in which there would be no assets for the adviser to manage. The expense under an assets under management approach can be a deterrent for people just getting started. The flat fee for service approach offers a more affordable entry point, yet that fee structure can quickly become cumbersome as both the client and the adviser seek to do more. As a result, advisers and potential clients increasingly are turning toward a subscription fee model.","Spencer, Pat", Feature,Jan,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Software , Bonds , Stocks , Asset management , Retirement planning , Social networks , Subscriptions , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

STATE INCOME TAXATION OF NONRESIDENT EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION,"Noncash, equity-based compensation is perpetually popular as companies look for ways to attract and retain top talent. A tax issue often arises in the context of a state attempting to tax such income of a nonresident. When an individual has lived and worked in a state, and then becomes a nonresident of that state and receives income from equity-based compensation, the issue becomes whether any of that income is nonresident source income taxable by the former state of residence. If one is changing residency to avoid state income tax, it is important to know what income will still be taxed by the former state of residence. Indeed, there is little point in changing residency for tax purposes only to find a high percentage of your income will continue to have a source, and thus be taxable, in the state of former residence. This sourcing issue is not only of concern to the taxpayer-employee, but also to the employer, who is typically required under state law to withhold tax from compensation income earned in the state to approximate the employee's in-state personal income tax liability.","Coffill, Eric J", Commentary,Oct,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," State laws , Compensation , Employers , Personal income , Income taxes , Nonresidents , State court decisions",ProQuest One Academic

Investment Diversification and Client Resistance: A Behavioral Understanding,"Financial planning seems straightforward when examining the CFP Board's standardized process. Financial planners begin by asking key questions to understand client situations, set client goals, and identify financial strengths and vulnerabilities. Financial planners then develop recommendations, present those recommendations, and implement the agreed-upon recommendations. However, there are disconnects that emerge when advisers offer recommendations and during the financial plan's implementation. One such disconnect occurs when clients have overweighted positions in their portfolios, which they may adamantly desire to maintain. These concentrated positions may have resulted from a plethora of explanations, such as an inheritance, participation in an employer-sponsored stock plan, or from investments that have greatly appreciated relative to other investment positions. When working with novice investors and their portfolios containing overweighted positions, financial planners' pleas for diversification may seem negligible to clients.","Glasgow, Robert;Meyers, Steven;Walsh, Courtney;Pearson, Blain, PhD, CFP®, AFC", Commentary,Oct,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Investment , Investors , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

How Do Commodities Fit into Client Portfolios?,"The standard stock--bond portfolio mix remains the bread-and-butter combination of investment vehicles for the financial planning community, even as the search for assets to complement these fundamental building blocks of client portfolios continues. Over the past 20 years, the investment infrastructure around commodities has transformed the asset class in such a way as to substantially improve the feasibility of client participation. Further, recent insights regarding the long-term behavior of gold prices can be extended to the broader class of commodities, providing a basis for the formation of return expectations for the asset class. However, coincident with the decreased cost of commodity exposure and increased access for clients, there has also been a change in the fundamental investment profile of commodities. These changes include increased correlation with equities, which are typically the primary driver of client returns and risk, as well as a change in the components of inflation with which commodities exhibit correlation. Here, Jason and Kristin review these developments and synthesize the implications for financial planners attempting to use the commodity asset class to improve client portfolios.","Fink, Jason D;Fink, Kristin E", Commentary,Oct,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Investment , Bonds , Stocks , Inflation , Assets , Financial planners , Investments , Bond portfolios , Commodities",ProQuest One Academic

Essential Tax Rules of Cross-Border Gifting,"Strategic gift planning, done usually to minimize or eliminate the estate and expatriation taxes, is firmly within the purview of tax and financial advisers. The vast majority of gifting occurs in a purely domestic setting, and most experienced advisers are indeed aware of the essential tax consequences to the parties involved in such gifting. The US gift tax consequences, however, may not necessarily be immediately intuitive or apparent, even to many seasoned advisers, when one party to the transaction is a nonresident. Advisers who specialize in working with international clients are undoubtedly familiar with the plethora of special obligations and penalties for noncompliance imposed on both cross-border gift donors and donees under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Considering that people live in an increasingly integrated world wherein global human movement and settlement is the norm, it would be highly beneficial for generalist advisers to also become familiar with at least the essential tax rules of cross-border gifting.","Malik, Anthony", Commentary,Oct,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Gift taxes , Financial planners , Estate taxes",ProQuest One Academic

Implications of SECURE Act 2.0 on Retirement Decumulation Strategies,"Secure Act 2.0 passed the House and it is expected to pass the Senate, perhaps with some changes, later this year. This Act would raise the age at which required minimum distributions (RMDs) must begin from the current age of 72 to 73 in 2023, to 74 in 2030, and to 75 in 2033. By 2033, this would allow retirees to avoid making any tax-deferred account (TDA)) withdrawals from ages 72 through 74. However, just because these retirees would not have to make TDA withdrawals in these three years does not mean that they should not make any TDA withdrawals in these years. The tax liability of TDA balances does not disappear if the household chooses to make no TDA withdrawals in these years. Furthermore, this tax liability does not disappear at death. Thus, the objective should be to withdraw TDA funds in a manner that would minimize the embedded tax liability. Here, Reichenstein presents a case study that clearly explains why households should make some TDA withdrawals in their pre-RMD years before they turn 72, even though they are not required to do so.","Reichenstein, William, PhD CFA", Journal Article,Sep,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Taxes , Tax legislation , Retirement plans , Retirement , Tax rates , Life expectancy , Age , Stocks , Liability , Asset allocation , Financial planning , Households , Medicare , Case studies , Tax increases",ProQuest One Academic

Modern Post-mortem Estate Planning for Noncitizen Spouses: Why Qualified Domestic Trusts Are a Risky Proposition,"Trusts are an essential part of estate planning. These legal ""creatures"" often mystify laypersons as obscure vehicles offering tax saving opportunities to the rich. While there is often some truth to this, administering certain types of trusts can be a matter of enormous complexity, even for the most qualified advisers, and careless planning can lead to catastrophic consequences. The qualified domestic trust (QDOT) is perhaps the most complex of these estate planning vehicles. Qualified domestic trusts are born by the interplay of (a) the distinction between income and wealth, and (b) the jurisdictional limitations on the reach of U.S. tax laws on the wealth of noncitizens. The reason for the vastly different outcomes can be easily explained. Wealth, unlike income, is static. Wealth is or will be while income comes in. Therefore, income can be taxed when it ""comes in.""

What Will Be Your Body of Work?,"Van Zutphen reflects on his body of work. As a CFP® professional focused on providing financial life planning, his body of work extends well beyond the cards and letters and exists in motion as their firm serves over 200 clients across the country. It shows up in the estate plans they help clients complete, college graduations, weddings, and births of children, grandchildren, and even great grandchildren. It shows up in the insurance they help clients acquire and the benefits paid. As financial planning professionals, they have daily opportunities to reach out to human beings to encounter and meanings to fulfill, to transcend themselves, and to experience the side effects of happiness and gratitude because they chose to commit their care, skill, and judgment in service to their client's journey toward their ideal selves.","Van Zutphen, Neal, CFP®, FBS, CRPC", Commentary,Aug,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Client relationships , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic
The Power of Reframing: Analyzing When Things Go Right,"When things go wrong in their firms, many advisers will call everybody together and ask, ""What happened?"" Then they proceed to examine where the system broke down so they can make a plan to fix the issue. But when we're having success--clients are having a great experience, and we're getting referrals and experiencing a lot of organic growth--do we sit down with the team and examine what in the system is going well? There's no shortage of articles touting the benefits of being able to learn from failure and adaptability. When things are going well for your business, you can categorize the ""why"" into two buckets: things you can't control and things you can control. Things you can't control are things like the markets, which over the past few years have given many folks--boomers like me--a nice tailwind to explore whether they can retire sooner than they'd hoped. You didn't create these opportunities yourself, so you can't replicate them.","Opitz, Greg", Commentary,Aug,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Baby boomers , Adaptability , Referrals , Executives , Internet of Things",ProQuest One Academic

Buckeyes to Gather in Columbus this November,"Three Ohio chapters are coming together for the first All-Ohio Symposium Nov 9-10 in Columbus OH. The Central Ohio, Northeast Ohio, and Southwestern Ohio chapters have held separate annual events in the past, but this will be the first coordinated event of this size. A board member from the Central Ohio chapter officially put forth the idea in 2021, and everyone was on board. Leaders at the three chapters had discussed something like this for a while, but it was only seriously considered lately after a couple years of the lockdown. The three chapters leveraged their strengths in delegating different parts of planning the symposium. They have a main planning committee, which includes about two people from each chapter. Then the three executives each took a different component as their responsibility.

Student Loan Forgiveness Period Ending Soon,"On October 6, 2021, the U.S. Department of Education announced a temporary change to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program rules due to the pandemic. Normally, a former student could have their student debt forgiven after making payments for 10 years, if they had Direct Loans and their payments were linked to an income-driven repayment plan, among other requirements. The Direct Loan and income-driven plan requirements were waived as part of the temporary change, meaning that one can get credit for past payments that normally wouldn't have qualified. But this requirement-waiving period is soon ending. Meagan Landress, CSLP, a student loan consultant and owner of Financial Coach Meagan, summarizes it well by saying, it doesn't matter what repayment plan you were on. It doesn't matter what kind of loan you have, as long as you had worked full-time in public service, and you have federal student loans. Then they'll give you credit for those months toward PSLF.","Cummings, Bridger", Feature,Aug,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Student loans , Payments , College students , Bank loans , Debt cancellation",ProQuest One Academic
Digital Assets Add New Concerns to Estate Planning,"There are many things that can be passed along in an estate: cash, stocks, property, family heirlooms, etc. The latest addition to the many items to be concerned about is digital assets. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been in a bit of a rough spot lately. Bitcoin value has dropped a bit to, as of the time of writing, just over $30,000. The Luna coin is all but worthless now. The idea for NFTs is simple, you buy some form of digital currency and then you own it. But the devil is in the details, and owning a digital asset requires a few steps. You need to use a private key that has to be linked with your digital wallet. Essentially, it's the password to that ""digital asset bank account."" The very idea is that it is unregulated and decentralized, and if you lose the login information, then, while the asset still ""exists,"" it will be permanently unrecoverable.","Cummings, Bridger", Journal Article,Aug,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Digital asset management , Data integrity , Digital currencies , Blockchain , Estate planning",ProQuest One Academic
Three Factors to Consider When Choosing Your Fee Model,"Woods discusses the three factors that advisory firms should consider when choosing their fee model. First, offer a fair and transparent fee schedule. A fair fee is a fee tied to a uniform metric that can be extrapolated across various types of financial planning engagements based on complexity. Second, consider multiple fee models to meet clients where they are. With more gig economy workers and contractors in the labor force, it's important to consider different models that may work best for their unique cash flows. The third and final suggestion for developing a fee schedule is to determine how you will implement some pro bono planning into your practice.","Woods, Christopher, CFP®, CKA", Journal Article,Aug,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Pro bono services , Professional fees , Financial planning , Business models , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Till Death Do Us Part ESTATE PLANNING DURING DIVORCE,"Mark Prendergast, is the director of tax strategies at Inspired Financial, a financial planning firm that focuses on women in transition, in Huntington Beach, California. He specializes in tax, estate, and divorce planning. Mark has served in FPA leadership positions at the chapter, state, and national levels. During divorce proceedings, the financial planner and the client rarely think about estate planning. Gray divorce is a generic term for divorce after age 50, the fastest growing demographic for divorce; therefore, the estate planning topic should not be ignored. We discuss which estate planning techniques can and cannot be executed during the divorce process. For a healthy couple in their 30s or 40s, the risk of death may be very small. For couples in their 60s, 70s, or 80s, the risk is significantly higher, and if you throw in known health issues, a call to action may be paramount. Some strategies cost little and are easy to implement, such as breaking a joint tenancy. Others, such as a new pour-over will with an unfunded revocable living trust, are more costly.","Prendergast, Mark L, CFP® CPA CDFA", Feature,Aug,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Divorce , Real estate , Financial planning , Marital separation , Estate planning",ProQuest One Academic
SECURE Act 2.0,"The House passed Secure Act 2.0 in March, passing it along to the Senate. They will likely make some modifications, but the act has experienced bipartisan support so far. The first SECURE Act was passed in 2019, and it focused on increasing access to retirement accounts that are tax-advantaged in order to ensure that Americans don't outlive their assets. It also enabled people to start taking their required minimum distributions at 72 years old, among some other changes. A notable inclusion in the second act is automatically enrolling employees in a defined contribution plan, typically starting off at 3 percent and increasing by 1 percent each year up until about 10 or 15 percent. If the participant doesn't decide which investment choice they would like to partake in, it would default to a qualified default investment alternative. These would apply to 401(k) and 403(b) plans. The new act also increases the annual amount that employees aged 62-64 can put in toward ""catching up"" with their 401(k) and 403(b) plans to $10,000.","Cummings, Bridger", News,Jul,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Legislation , Investment , Assets , Defined contribution plans , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic
Pre-Graduation Goal Alignment Would Benefit Financial Planning Students and Professionals,"Students hoping to set themselves apart from their peers on a financial services path might be wise to prioritize sitting for the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) exam pregraduation, given the results of a recent survey Redtail Technology conducted in conjunction with Brigham Young University-Idaho: ""Financial Planning Career Perceptions 2021."" Two significant findings in the survey of 4,033 financial professionals and 224 financial planning students were that 71.2 percent of financial professionals recommend aspiring advisers sit for the CFP exam while still in school, and that professionals and students alike overwhelmingly prioritize the development of strong interpersonal skills. There are likely several reasons why financial planning students don't put taking the CFP exam higher on their to-do lists. Students are understandably overwhelmed toward the end of their college careers; the pressure of final exams and other graduation requirements coupled with anxiety over finding a job quickly to begin repaying hefty college loans tends to take its toll, even on those who are typically adept at stress management.","McLaughlin, Brian, CEO", Commentary,Jul,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Student loans , College students , Careers , Financial services , Students , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

At first, she was emphatically against it. Eventually, she relented, and when Texas A&amp;M's financial planning program was launched during her senior year, she was able to ""miraculously squeeze in the curriculum.""

Why Clients Might (or Might Not!) Want to Raid Qualified Plans,"Once clients fully understand the potential positive and negative impacts of taking elective distributions from qualified plans, they can decide how to proceed. Each client needs assistance from a knowledgeable and caring team of experts. The team should ideally include a financial planner, tax professional, and estate planning expert, all working together and sharing critical information. Considering uncertainty about the future and the impossibility of perfect prediction, clients should make wise and informed incremental decisions. For each client and each tax year, the goal might be to find the exact amount of funds to distribute from qualified plans without increasing the marginal tax rate, the future cost of Medicare Part B, the taxation of Social Security, or the phasing-out of other benefits.","Duke, Anne C, PhD CPA", Cover Story,Jul,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Taxation , Financial management , Medicare , Estate planning , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

They took a poll asking if they would attend, and if so, would they like to see vaccination requirements. And they had more people say yes than not. They were worried; if they require it, how many people are they going to lose because they didn't or they did require it?

This paper makes conclusions with respect to whether a client's marital status needs exclusive consideration in the context of financial planning and the investment management process. Using data from 1,174 financial decision-makers, it was determined that marital status is not uniformly associated with financial risk tolerance. Financial knowledge emerged from the analyses as the most important descriptor of financial risk tolerance across genders.

Not a set age, dollar amount, pressure from a spouse, or what a retirement adviser believes should be done. A perspective that focuses on the internal aspects of retirement readiness.

How Embedded Finance Can Solve the Gig Economy's Retirement Planning Problem,"Fava conveys that nearly 60 million Americans participate in the gig economy? That's over 36 percent of the entire American workforce. The gig economy is made up of a group of workers who engage in on-demand work, usually app-based, which is paid per interaction rather than by salary. Gig workers often consider themselves freelancers, and the average person interacts with them more than you may think. Some of the most well-known gig economy jobs include Uber drivers, Instacart shoppers, and Rover pet sitters. The gig economy is enormous--and growing. There's almost $1 trillion in total income generated from gig work, and according to one study, the gig economy is growing three times faster than the traditional workforce. Many of these gig workers view their income as supplemental to the income they are already earning from their more permanent jobs. However, that mindset is shifting as more gig opportunities continue to become widely available online, posing an opportunity to maximize one's earnings.","Fava, Dani", Commentary,Jul,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Gig economy , Careers , Income , Earnings , Workforce , Employment",ProQuest One Academic

In preretirement years, the marginal tax rate (MTR) for a single individual or married couple filing jointly is usually the same as their tax bracket. However, as explained in the next two sections, their MTR in retirement years is often substantially higher than their tax bracket, due to the taxation of Social Security benefits and income-based Medicare premiums.","Reichenstein, William, PhD;Meyer, William", Journal Article,Jul,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Taxation , Tax rates , Income , Premiums , Medicare , Taxes , Financial planning , Couples , Social security , Taxable income , Retirees , Households , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

Inflation Inflating Years Worked,"People keep seeing news about inflation in the headlines. It is higher than it's been in over 40 years. And some people are very concerned about that.

Reasons ranged from losing their jobs to deciding they didn't want to risk contracting COVID-19 to caring for other family members. But now there's a new player in town that is causing almost the opposite effect. As of the time of writing, inflation is at 8.3 percent. That is down from 8.5 percent in March, but that is still higher than it's been in decades.

Angel Investors: Spending Social Capital to Sponsor New Planners,"Andrus asserts that most new planners trying to build their expertise in financial planning have probably considered working with a mentor at some point. Some planners may have even served as a mentor to someone who looked up to them at some point in their lives. Mentoring is a valuable tool to socialize newcomers to the norms of a profession and help them develop their skills. Sponsorship is the other side of the mentoring coin. Instead of working with an individual, a sponsor talks to other people and spends some of their own social capital to invest in the individual. If you've ever recommended a CPA or estate planner to someone, that's sponsorship. Without this distinction between sponsorship and mentorship, people think that they're acting as sponsors when they're actually acting as mentors, and it doesn't get you the same outcomes.""

Psychographics Related to the Ownership of Life Insurance,"Life insurance is primarily designed to protect the insured against the possibility of losing an income stream, such as the premature death of the family breadwinner (Thoyts 2010).

It is important to better estimate the effect of consumers' psychological characteristics on demand for life insurance purchases to increase the adequacy of the suggestions and relevance to consumers' life situations.

But nobody wants to directly intervene and have open war with a nuclear power, so most of the actions taken by the U.S. and other governments have been more indirect. Economic sanctions against Russia, mostly aimed at specific oligarchs, keep piling up.","Cummings, Bridger", News,Jun,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Cold War , International relations , Ukraine , Russia , Putin, Vladimir",ProQuest One Academic
Servicing Planners' Service Models,"Financial planning firm owners are confident that they deliver exceptional service. However, they become so bogged down in the details of working in their business that they forget to work on the business. One quick win for firm owners to tackle is outlining their client service model and structuring it in a way that serves both themselves and their clients. By understanding what your clients need from you and how you want to engage within your business, you can set up a business model that leaves everyone happy with your services. You may offer just one of these services, or your firm might have all three available for new clients. Whatever the case may be, consider which benefits each level of service encompasses. This should highlight both the ideal client type for each of your services and how the service model or calendar can appropriately address their needs.","Spiller, Charesse", Commentary,Jun,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Customer services , Quality of service , Business models , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic
My Career Path Featuring Mark Tibergien,"Mark Tibergien is a partner and independent board member at Englewood, New Jersey-based RIA Pathstone. Before that, he was the respected long-time leader of BNY Mellon Pershing. Before that, he was an obituary writer. Mark said that in those early days, he didn't have formal mentoring relationships, but there are individuals who made a clear impact on his career and set him on a path to financial services. One of those informal mentors was George Matheson, Chicago regional manager for Investment Dealers' Digest. In addition to introducing him to finance as a career choice, Mark's early mentor also helped him consider a career as something that could be crafted by an individual based on their shifting objectives, not a set path they had to follow. Mark pointed out that the best mentor probably isn't your boss because it's harder to have candid conversations.

Upsizing in Retirement,"Armstrong asserts that in my last two articles, when I discussed housing considerations for women in retirement (August 2021 and November 2021), I worked under the assumption that most retirees downsize when they retire. However, after reading an extensive article in The Wall Street Journal, I realized that this wasn't universally true. In fact, this article described some empty nesters who decided to buy a much bigger home instead of moving into a smaller, lower-maintenance home for their golden years. With people living longer, I would suggest that these approaches might work well particularly for the affluent retiree in their earlier retirement years, but eventually these people might get to the next stage of their lives when they want to downsize. The reason I introduce these contrarian points of view is I think we need to be aware of this alternative approach, which your clients might want to explore.","Armstrong, Alexandra, CFP®", Commentary,Jun,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Women , Older people , Retirees , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic

Are Americans Donating Less?,"Fewer Americans have donated to charities over the last 20 or so years, according to an article by Vox titled ""What Happened to Giving Money to Charity?"" The amount of donations keeps going up; it grew to $480 billion last year, but that is coming from fewer and fewer donors over the years. Since 2000, 20 million fewer American households have donated to charity, meaning less than 50 percent of all households are donating money now. That is, if you are only counting money donated to recognized charities. Many charities and philanthropy organizations have been trying to reconcile the fact that fewer people are donating, but it might be that there are just a lot of uncounted donations--people's time, direct goods, etc. It's easy to track money donated to charities because it's tracked by the IRS, and that data can easily be pulled.","Cummings, Bridger", Commentary,Dec,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Charities , Philanthropy , Households , Donations",ProQuest One Academic
Contingency Fund: Individual Retiree Risk Management,"Branning and Grubbs provide an actionable framework for contingency planning for individual retirees through the modern retirement theory (MRT) perspective. Contingency planning encompasses a retiree's risk management processes, techniques, and strategies, along with a choice architecture. Their goal is to provide insights that are mitigating to those conditions within longevity that can impair or impact a retiree's ability to remain retired. They offer three risk categories--known, unknown, and unknowable--as an organizational scaffold that demands an intentional choice be made by the retiree. Then, to guide an individual retiree's decisions about contingency planning, they put forth an active risk selection matrix. The 3-R matrix can be used for guiding and evaluating risk choices through risk recognition, risk reduction, and acceptance of residual risk.","Branning, Jason K, CFP® RICP;Grubbs, M Ray, PhD", Commentary,Dec,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Retirement , Risk management , Retirees , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic

Clients are beginning to expect a level of automation and tech-powered services when searching for firms, making it even more critical for business owners to have a tech stack that supports their operation. Many advisers do have an existing tech stack, and often there are pieces that are free or inexpensively given to them through their various industry memberships.

Are Donor-Advised Funds a Suitable Method for Donating to Just Causes?,"For charitably inclined clients, there are several opportunities to give and even more complications. Some of the more popular options for clients to give to charities that they care about are direct donations, qualified charitable distributions from an IRA, private foundations, and donor-advised funds. The latter is getting more popular, and for many good reasons. A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a private fund sponsored by a charitable organization. Organizations control the contributions they receive, but donors have advisory privileges over how assets are invested and funds are distributed. This contrasts with private foundations, which are run and administered by the board members of the foundation. These are similar but distinct vehicles for donating to charities and receiving tax breaks in the process.","Cummings, Bridger", Cover Story,Dec,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Charities , Donations , Assets",ProQuest One Academic

Opening the Door: Welcoming Students and Career Changers to Financial Planning,"Candidates can arm themselves with a few tools as they compete for scarce high-quality financial planning roles. First, they need to insist on an understanding of the career path within a firm. Candidates need to have a clear understanding of the opportunities ahead, or accept and acknowledge that there might not be any. Second, understanding the firm's compensation philosophy, and how that ties to advancement, development as a professional, or business development is critical. A common reason that candidates move from one firm to another is a mismatch of compensation expectations; expecting to be paid more when they reach milestones they believe relevant, while not meeting complementary firm expectations. Finally, candidates should do their best to increase visibility to potential employers. Not all firms are going to post their positions publicly and attempt to recruit from beyond their network. Being known as a career changer, job seeker, or up-and-coming financial planner might help you get a request to apply from a firm or a suggestion that your name be put in the roster for interviews.","Yerger, Daniel, CFP® ChFC AIF CDFA", Commentary,Dec,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Candidates , Financial planning , Compensation , Careers , Financial planners , Professional development",ProQuest One Academic

The purpose of asset allocation is to mitigate risk with a basket of securities that have different reactions to the same set of circumstances and match said portfolio with the stated risk profile of an investor. As the saying goes, the umbrella salesman will sell 40 units when it rains and nothing when it's sunny, while the sunglasses salesman would have the opposite outcome.

The Science of Building Trust and Commitment in Financial Planning: Using Structural Equation Modeling to Examine Antecedents to Trust and Commitment,"The current study is a replication and extension of the early work of Sharpe et al. (2007). They found strong empirical support for financial life planning in fostering trust and commitment in the planner-client relationship. To expand on Sharpe et al. (2007), the study at hand provides an in-depth exploration of the theory of trust and commitment developed by Morgan and Hunt (1994) with a focus on the antecedents to the formation of commitment and trust from a client's perception. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results support the theoretical model. Specifically, that trust and commitment are built by the following antecedents: (1) communication abilities, (2) an absence of opportunistic behavior, (3) perceived relationship benefits, (4) the costs of terminating the relationship, and (5) shared values. These results suggest that technical skills alone, such as generating high investment returns, may not be sufficient to build client trust and commitment and provide continued financial life planning support.","McCoy, Megan, PhD LMFT AFC CFT-I;Machiz, Ives, CFP®;Harris, Josh, CFP® AFC;Lynn, Christina, CFP® AFC CDFA;Lawson, Derek, PhD CFP®;Rollins-Koons, Ashlyn", Commentary,Dec,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Financial planning , Trust , Return on investment , Financial planners , Professional relationships",ProQuest One Academic

Sustainable Investing for Financial Planners in Times of War,"When Russia invaded Ukraine in Feb 2022, few estimated the extent by which global financial markets would be rattled and post-pandemic recovery efforts would be stymied. In times of conflict and economic instability, there is a predictable rise in oil and gas prices and a surge in armament stock prices; all of which are typically screened out by environmental, social, and governance (ESG) portfolios. While investing experts have touted and supported the surge in popularity of ESG in recent years, there has been a slight exodus in interest for sustainable investments, with critics citing a lack of strong investment performance during times of war. Sustainable investing practices are considerably important during times of war and sociopolitical instability since they offer a way to look at investments that will thrive well beyond the conflict's resolution. Additionally, sustainable investing practices have historically been instrumental in curtailing the duration of oppressive regimes and practices. There is nothing inherently growth-oriented about the industries that thrive during times of war, and their rallies are largely short-lived. Therefore, rather than riding the waves of short-term volatility, it is far more important to consider factors in building a portfolio that will withstand the test of time.","Coombs, Jennifer N, CSRIC, CRPC", Commentary,Nov,2022,Journal of Financial Planning," Invasions , Investment , War , Stock prices , Sustainability management , Financial services , Volatility",ProQuest One Academic

FINANCIAL ADVICE: WHAT ABOUT LOW-INCOME CONSUMERS?,"This paper uses data from the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) to analyze the determinants and benefits of financial advice use, with a special emphasis on the low-income group. While, as expected, this group fares worse financially, we also find that they have different needs and priorities. For example, they use less investment advice than insurance advice. A discriminant analysis reveals that cost plays a lesser role in their decision to seek advice. Using an instrument variable strategy, we conclude that certain types of advice improve clients' financial behaviors, with greater benefits for the low-income group.

AFTER THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS: ATTITUDES TOWARD IMMEDIATE ANNUITIES,"Based on the life cycle hypothesis, this study examined the attitudes toward immediate annuities of university employees 50 to 65 years old after the onset of the global financial crisis. Annuity attitudes were negatively correlated with risk tolerance and positively linked to life expectancy. Current income, expectation of receiving a pension, professed familiarity with annuities, and confidence that retirement assets would last were not related to annuity attitudes. Confirming the annuity puzzle, respondents claiming to be most familiar with immediate annuities expressed the least positive attitudes. Multiple regression analysis revealed that risk tolerance and familiarity with annuities were significantly negatively predictive of annuity attitudes. The results did not support the life cycle hypothesis. Future research should measure actual annuity knowledge and test for a curvilinear relationship between assets and annuity attitudes. Recommendations for financial advisors and educators are provided on how to frame annuities, plus suggestions for future research.

CONVERTING A TRADITIONAL IRA TO A ROTH IRA: BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS,"Congress eliminated the income limit required for converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA in 2010. The conversion must be recognized as income for tax purposes in the year of conversion. However, a traditional IRA may be partially converted each year, spreading the conversion over two or more years and effectively distributing the tax burden over the conversion period and potentially allowing the converter to remain in a lower marginal income tax bracket. This may make conversion from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA extremely attractive. This analysis considers conversions, develops a mathematical model to determine the time to break even (in years) when converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, and provides a Monte Carlo Simulation of the model based upon historic financial market data for bonds and equities. The simulation provides information that may serve to guide investors as the conversion decision is made, yet the decision remains an individual one and may be influenced by factors other than the time to break even.

WHEN TO CLAIM SOCIAL SECURITY RETIREMENT BENEFITS,"Social Security (SS) is the largest source of retirement income for most Americans. This paper provides the reader with an overview of the SS retirement system and offers insight into key factors that should be considered when determining when to begin receiving SS retirement benefits. Five separate tests are performed, each of which considers a component that is important to the optimal claiming decision, such as life expectancy, taxes, the cost of purchasing equivalent insurance, and the benefits of the surviving spouse. Three claiming scenarios are considered: receiving benefits early (e.g., at age 62 versus 66); delaying benefits past Full Retirement Age (e.g., age 66 versus 70); and the maximum realistic delay period (e.g., at age 62 versus 70). The results of this analysis suggest most retirees would be best served delaying SS benefits until at least Full Retirement Age (FRA) or later, and that delayed SS benefits are especially valuable for females, married couples, retirees who expect to invest in relatively conservative portfolios during retirement, and retirees who have longer life expectancies. The effective ""return"" achieved by a retiree from making the optimal SS decision can significantly exceed the return he or she could potentially earn by investing the monies received from starting benefits earlier and ""investing the difference,"" especially in today's low interest rate enviromnent. We find the optimal Social Security claiming decision can generate 9.15% more income for a hypothetical retired married couple, which creates an annual equivalent ""financial planning alpha"" (or Gamma) of +0.74% per year.","Blanchett, David, CFA, CFP", Feature,,2012,Journal of Personal Finance," Financial planning , Studies , Social security , Retirees , Retirement benefits , Age , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
ARE SAFE WITHDRAWAL RATES REALLY SAFE?,"Retirees in 1921, 1966, and 2010 have little in common. Each faced a different life expectancy and invested in a different economic climate with varying inflation expectations, interest rates, and market valuations. These dates weren't chosen at random: one had the highest safe withdrawal rate in recorded history, the other the lowest, and the third barely survived the ravages of inflation. Each of these three retirees lived through dramatically different economic times, yet according to conventional wisdom they all share the same safe withdrawal rate in retirement-roughly 4% according to traditional retirement withdrawal methodology (e.g. Bengen, 1994).

INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFERS IN THE IMMIGRANT FAMILY: EVIDENCE FROM THE NEW IMMIGRANT SURVEY,"With the growing number of immigrants in the United States, it is important to understand how they make financial transfers between generations. Using the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), this study investigates the factors of intergenerational financial transfer among newly lawful U.S. immigrants. Analysis showed that demographic, socioeconomic and acculturation factors were associated with intergenerational transfers among immigrants. Age, education, income, financial assets, country of origin, and mild health problems were significantly related to the intergenerational transfers among immigrants. The motives behind intergenerational transfers are discussed. Implications for policies regarding immigrants and financial education for immigrants are presented.

MARKET PERFORMANCE AND THE TIMING OF RETIREMENT,"This study is the first to utilize nine interview waves of the Health and Retirement Study and multilevel discrete-time survival analysis to investigate the effect of market returns on individual elective retirement decisions. Individuals who retire at a market peak have an increased risk of shortening the longevity of their retirement income. Unfortunately, market returns were found to have a significant positive effect on the probability of retirement. Researchers, employers, financial educators and financial practitioners should help pre-retirees overcome the stock market's influence on their decision-making to avoid the negative effect of market sequencing on their retirement wealth.

FACTORS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNER-MANAGER HOUSEHOLDS,"We investigate financial vulnerability of households with small business owner managers, using 1992 to 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances datasets. Based on regression analyses of two ratios, business assets to total household assets and business income to total household income, we find that vulnerability in terms of both ratios increases with the number of employees and the number of years in business. The income ratio increases with age up to age 48, then decreases. Black households are less vulnerable (have lower income ratios) than White households. Single head households are more vulnerable than married couples in terms of the business to household income ratio. Those willing to take substantial investment risks have higher business asset ratios than those unwilling to take any risks.

APPLYING NEUROSCIENCE TO FINANCIAL PLANNING PRACTICE: A FRAMEWORK AND REVIEW,"This paper presents findings from neuroscience, neuro-finance, neuro-economics, behavioral finance, and behavioral economics in the context of a two-system model of human decision-making, labeled as the ""rider"" and the ""elephant"". The rational ""rider"" system is characterized by overconfidence and deficiencies in speed and endurance. The emotional ""elephant"" system is characterized by time preference myopia, emotional marker processing, and loss aversion. Application of this neural model of financial decision-making results in a variety of effective and practical suggestions for financial planners.

STUDENT FINANCIAL COUNSELING: AN ANALYSIS OF A CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL SAMPLE,"The purpose of this study was to determine what factors predict whether students will seek on-campus peer-based financial counseling. An attempt was made to determine if students who seek help differ significantly from students who do not seek help. Findings provide a profile of college student financial counseling help-seekers. College-age financial counseling help seekers tend to be older, less satisfied with their income, less knowledgeable, less wealthy, and more stressed. The results from this study suggest that college financial counseling centers appear to be on target in connecting with some of the students they were designed to reach. Continued efforts to assist students with high financial stress may be a way to increase financial well-being among college students.

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN RISK AVERSION: A DEVELOPING NATION'S CASE,"This study used Hanna and Lindamood (2004)'s graphic-based survey instrument to examine whether women who are employed in the Nepalese banking sector show more risk aversion than men. Women indeed reported their intention to take less risk and invested less of their wealth in risky assets than men. However, the difference disappeared after controlling for other relevant variables, notably their perceived knowledge of financial markets. Our analyses suggested that women demonstrated more risk aversion than men because they considered themselves to be less knowledgeable about financial markets. Our findings support the need to educate female investors to increase their confidence in their abilities to succeed in the world of finance.

MUTUAL FUND TAX EFFICIENCY AND INVESTMENT SELECTION,"We examine six factors that may be important when looking for a more tax efficient mutual fund. We consider the pre- and post-liquidation bases for over 4,000 mutual funds in logical groupings. Our results for turnover show that its effect on tax efficiency depends upon conditions in the securities markets. A falling market leads to greater tax efficiency due to security sales at depressed prices. We have a similar finding for expense categories probably because increased sales lead to higher expenses. We find greater tax efficiency if mutual funds have institutional status, no-loads, and no 12b-1 plan.

CAN DUAL BETA FILTERING IMPROVE INVESTOR PERFORMANCE?,"This study investigates the possibility that more efficient portfolios may be constructed by using the dual-beta model that screens out assets that exhibit more extreme downside risk sensitivity. Three portfolios were constructed, using the criteria of standard CAPM beta, down-market beta, and a combination of up-market and down-market betas. Overall, the standard CAPM beta consistently lags the dual-betas. When compared to the Fama-French three-factor inspired DFEOX, the dual-betas also performed reasonably well, with the ability to contain the downside while participating in the upside.

PUBLIC AWARENESS OF RETIREMENT PLANNING RULES OF THUMB,"Retirement planning advice commonly takes the form of rules of thumb offered in self-help books, magazine articles, and Internet Web sites. The rules provide simple answers to questions about how much to save, how to allocate retirement investments, and how to safely draw down retirement savings. The accuracy of these rules is hotly debated among finance scholars, but little is known about the extent to which members of the public are aware of these rules. This study examines awareness of four widely-disseminated retirement rules of thumb among employees of a large university (N=3,095). Male respondents and those with higher levels of education are more aware of these rules than females and people with lower levels of education, but fewer than half of respondents are aware of even the best known of the four rules studied. Finally, the authors discuss the implications of the results for financial planning professionals.","Mayer, Robert N, PhD;Zick, Cathleen D, PhD;Glaittli, Michelle", Feature,,2011,Journal of Personal Finance," Perceptions , Rules , Colleges & universities , Studies , Financial literacy , Retirement planning , Self help , Financial planning , Books , Households , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
SAFE WITHDRAWAL RATES FROM RETIREMENT SAVINGS FOR RESIDENTS OF EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES,"Researchers have mostly focused on U.S. historical data to develop the 4 percent withdrawal rate rule. This rule suggests that retirees can safely sustain retirement withdrawals for at least 30 years by initially withdrawing 4 percent of their savings and adjusting this amount for inflation in subsequent years. But, the time period covered in these studies represents a particularly favorable one for U.S. asset returns that is unlikely to be broadly experienced. This poses a concern about whether safe withdrawal rate guidance from the U.S. can be applied to other countries. Particularly for emerging economies, defined-contribution pension plans have been introduced along with under-developed or non-existing annuity markets, making retirement withdrawal strategies an important concern. We study sustainable withdrawal rates for the 25 emerging countries included in the MSCI indices and find that the sustainability of a 4 percent withdrawal rate differs widely and can likely not be treated as safe.

THE DEMAND FOR FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES,"Based on 1998 to 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances datasets the proportion of households reporting use of a financial planner increased from 21% in 1998 to 25% in 2007, with an estimated increase of almost five million households between 2004 and 2007. Multivariate analysis shows that the likelihood of using a financial planner is strongly related to risk tolerance, with those with low risk tolerance the least likely, and those with above average risk tolerance the most likely to use a financial planner, controlling for income, net worth, age, and other factors. Those with substantial risk tolerance have significantly lower likelihood of using a financial planner than those with above average risk tolerance. Black households are more likely but Hispanic and Other/Asian households are less likely than comparable White households to use a financial planner. The likelihood of using a financial planner increases with net worth for ranges above zero, but also increases as net worth decreases below zero.

Financial Planning Literature Survey,"This study is intended to provide an environmental scan of current research from Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and the United States, related to financial planning/services from 2003 to July 2010. The objective of this exercise is to try and highlight research areas where there may be gaps. This is not intended to review the research in any manner but rather to aggregate and document its existence in some broad based categories. The study was carried out in two parts. To begin with, research was collected, categorized and totalled to determine high and low volume areas. Finally, industry practitioners and academics were petitioned to provide their opinions. Based on our findings, Estate Distribution Analysis, Pension Alternatives and Tax Optimization were found to be the topics that require the most focus for further research. Modern Portfolio Theory, General Portfolio Management and Product Shelf were the categories that were determined to be the most overly researched areas.

CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AGAINST INSURANCE COMPANIES,"Evaluating the quality of service from a prospective insurer is a formidable challenge for insurance consumers and even for experienced financial advisors. One approach to evaluating ""service"" is to evaluate the insurer's complaint ratio. Using national complaint data for six basic lines of insurance in three recent years this paper explains how complaint data is generated and made available to insurance consumers and financial advisors, discusses the most common reasons for consumer complaints, and looks at the complaint ratios for different lines of business. The central issues, however, are whether complaint information is easily available to insurance consumers and financial advisors and whether such information is meaningful and useful. Implications for consumers and financial advisors are significant.

FINANCIAL LITERACY: A PRACTITIONER'S UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF INTEGRATION IN SCHOOL CURRICULA,"The first recommendation of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy (2008 Annual Report) is that ""the United States Congress or state legislatures should mandate financial education in all schools for students in grades Kindergarten through 12"". While many school districts have admirable ad hoc initiatives addressing students' financial literacy needs, a minority of states has mandated financial literacy in the classroom and very few have addressed financial literacy across the K-12 spectrum. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact efforts at the national, state and local levels are having toward introducing financial education in our classrooms and how practitioners can contribute to this effort. An examination of Council on Economic Education data and JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy data is conducted to assess the state-by-state status of financial literacy efforts.

DOES MARKET TIMING BASED ON P/E RATIOS IMPROVE BUY-AND-HOLD SAVINGS STRATEGIES?,"This paper investigates if incorporating market timing trading rules based on P/E ratios into buy-and-hold-strategies provide investors with higher income replacement ratios in retirement. Retirement income replacement ratios, or the level of retirement income needed upon entering retirement to maintain pre-retirement standard of living, are simulated under several assumptions for investors' pre-retirement savings rates and growth rates in gross income using real data over the 1936-2007 time period. Probability distributions for the retirement income replacement ratios are obtained and summary statistics are compared for numerous buy-and-hold and market timing strategies incorporating both fixed and shifting or life-cycle allocations to several asset classes. Our results show that market timing can work as buy-and-hold strategies complemented with easily implemented trading rules based on P/E ratios provide investors with the highest income replacement ratios in retirement.

SOCIAL SECURITY RETIREMENT DECISION MAKING: THE ECONOMIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS,"The Social Security retirement decision can be the most critical retirement decision affecting an individual's total retirement income and standard of living during retirement years. For the majority of retired Americans, Social Security is the major source of retirement income, and because of the changing pension environment in the United States, Social Security retirement benefits are the only source of stable income for an increasing number of retirees.

THE LEGACY FORMULA-MODULATING SPENDING TO ACHIEVE YOUR RETIREMENT GOALS,"Charles Dickens captured the essence of personal debt with his memorable statement in David Copperfield, ""Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery"". In this paper we present a practical and straight forward approach to calculate the spending profile a retiree should adopt to insure happiness and avoid insolvency over the period of their retirement. Many analyses address the question of what percentage can be withdrawn from a portfolio to insure (at various confidence levels) that the portfolio will outlive the portfolio owner. However the retiree's net worth from which they can draw such income is often more than a single portfolio. In this paper the concepts of present worth and Monte Carlo analysis are applied to common income, debt, and spending streams to calculate the modulation of the spending required during each year of retirement to meet the retiree's expectations in regards to longevity, legacy, and risk tolerance.

THE EFFECT OF FINANCIAL GOAL AND WEALTH CHANGE ON RISK TOLERANCE: AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION,"The current study aimed to investigate how different kinds of financial goals influence individuals' financial decisions under risk and how individuals adjust their risk preferences when their wealth level changes. Research hypotheses about consumer risk tolerance as related to financial goal, wealth level, and financial motivation domains (achievement/security) were proposed based on three descriptive theories. An investment game was employed in an experiment. The results showed a significant effect of financial goal on risk tolerance in both motivation domains. Specifically, in the achievement motivation domain, individuals who have a financial goal are more risk seeking than those without a financial goal; whereas in the security motivation domain individuals who have a financial goal are more risk averse than those without a financial goal. The results also revealed a significant effect of wealth change on individuals' risk tolerance. The pattern of the change of risk tolerance supported the research hypotheses regarding the wealth change effect, that is, individuals with an achievement goal will become increasingly risk seeking before reaching the goal; whereas individuals with a security goal will become increasingly risk averse before reaching the goal. Implications to financial planning also were discussed.

THE COLLEGE OR RETIREMENT DECISION,"Spending on college education can adversely affect retirement savings as well as savings for other goals. This paper examines the tradeoff between spending on college education and saving for retirement, and develops a model to estimate the amount of money for retirement sacrificed by funding a child's college education. The impact that an added year of spending on education has on the parents' retirement is also calculated. Using these findings, parents will be able to determine appropriate spending on college education. Students will better understand the decisions that their parents make and the frustrations that their parents may feel when the student does not progress as planned. Using the approach presented here financial planners and advisers can better aid their clients in life planning by focusing on the trade-offs between competing financial goals.

MORTGAGE MELTDOWN REVEALS IMPORTANCE OF FINANCIAL LITERACY EDUCATION,"This paper examines how a combination of financial illiteracy and loose lending standards during the real estate boom of 2001-2006, made consumers vulnerable to mortgages that were not in their best interest. It also discusses the use of subprime mortgages as a financing method during this period. The resulting economic consequences have not been pleasant and a renewed national attention has been drawn to America's financial illiteracy. Governmental and private organizations have responded by making available a plethora of educational materials, programs and national conferences for financial literacy education. Several of these resources are reviewed in this paper.

AN ESTIMATE OF THE RELIABILITY OF THE SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES RISK-TOLERANCE QUESTION,"The reliability of the Survey of Consumer Finances risk-tolerance question has not been reported in the literature. However, given the importance of reliability as a necessary condition for validity there is a need to know and report the question's reliability estimate. The purpose of this paper was to provide such an estimate. Several approaches were used to estimate the reliability of the question. Estimates of reliability ranged from a low of .07 to a high of .78. Although no precise reliability figure emerged from the analyses, results suggest that the reliability of the item most likely falls in the range of .52 to .59, with .59 being the most likely estimate of reliability.

MANAGING UPS AND DOWNS WITH CLIENTS: MANAGING EMOTIONS BY FINANCIAL ADVISORS,"Emotion has quickly become a popular topic in the study of organizations. It seems to be a catalyst of behavior from which no organization or industry is immune. Indeed, as it pertains to the financial services industry, the benefits of understanding emotional influence may be greatly significant. Specific to this discussion, understanding the influence of emotion in relational interactions between financial advisors and clients may well make the difference between long-term, profitable relationships and short-lived, dysfunctional ones. Accordingly, current research stresses the importance of relationships between clients and their financial service agents. In these relationships, commitment and trust are suggested as two essential factors. This article describes how emotion impacts this relationship and how these subsequent beneficial attributes, commitment and trust, engender stronger and more durable financial advisor/client relationships. Further, practical implications are discussed as to how advisors may use this information to effect such beneficial outcomes.

THE CASE FOR FLEXIBLE RETIREMENT PLANNING,"This paper examines the importance of the volatility of investment returns and the uncertainty of remaining lifespan in retirement planning. These factors cause the unnecessary sacrifice of higher withdrawals to reduce the probability of exhausting the retirement portfolio before death (portfolio ruin) if withdrawal rates are constant. Flexible retirement planning, characterized by withdrawal rate adjustments in response to unexpected portfolio performance or changes in expected remaining life, reduces the withdrawal rate sacrifice of probability-of-ruin protection. As Baby Boomers recognize the ""preparation gap"" consequence from low saving rates and longer expected life spans, flexible retirement planning will prove productive in improving the retirement lifestyle without unduly increasing the probability of ruin.

FINANCIAL BEHAVIORS AMONG HISPANIC IMMIGRANTS,"This study examined the financial behaviors of Hispanic immigrants. The impact of U.S. tenure, educational attainment, English proficiency, age at immigration, immigration status, and country of origin on remitting behaviors (amount and frequency), assistance provided to Hispanic immigrant newcomers (in terms of housing, food, money, and/or finding a job), and use of financial services (having a savings account, a checking account, and/or a credit card as well as using direct deposit or non-mainstream check cashing services) were examined. Data were collected from 616 female, Hispanic immigrants through a survey instrument. Findings indicate a significant relationship between age at immigration, immigration status, and country of origin with remittances (both amount and frequency) and between age at immigration and providing assistance to newcomers, while use of non-mainstream financial services appears to be driven by immigration status.

THE LIMITED IMPACT OF REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS ON INSOLVENCY AND BEQUEST ATTAINMENT,"IRS rules effective in 2002 mandate required minimal distributions (RMD) from tax deferred retirement accounts. This could result in higher taxes when that minimum distribution is greater than a planned distribution. While this would result in higher lifetime taxes paid, Monte Carlo simulations using historical market returns show that RMD has very little effect on the probability of insolvency for a typical investor with tax deferred retirement savings. The probability of attaining bequest targets was marginally affected by RMD. Saving or spending excess RMD made little difference to insolvency but did impact bequest attainment. Of note: highly skewed distributions of final savings make the assumption and application of means and t- tests inappropriate.

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN TIME AND RISK PREFERENCES OF FINANCIAL PLANNERS,"When helping clients make investing decisions, financial planners must deal with their own risk and time preference attributes as well as those of their clients. This paper examines whether known gender differences in these preferences are prevalent in financial experts. In a sample of 108 financial planners (of which 30 are female), female planners are not significantly more risk-averse than male planners. However, these women are more likely to exhibit prospect theory tendencies than the men, even after controlling for other factors (like age, experience, and reasoning process). The female planners also exhibit better (more patient) time preferences than their male counterparts. Lastly, there are no gender differences in the propensity to be fooled by frames.

ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS,"This study seeks to develop a better understanding of those factors that have an impact on college students' personal financial behavior. Students (N=3,525) from a major Mid-western university in the United States were tested on a six-question measure of personal financial knowledge. Results from a cumulative logit model suggest that being male, a non-minority student, receiving financial aid, having other debts, being financially independent, having had exposure to a course in personal finance, being a business major, and reporting more responsible credit card knowledge are all associated with higher scores on the measure of personal financial knowledge. The findings suggest that experience with financial issues plays a strong role in knowledge development, while also suggesting there is some link between personal financial knowledge and financial behavior.

Findings suggest there are major performance differences across funds as well as significant performance persistence among bank loan funds. For individual investors, results suggest investors should look for no-load funds in this category that have low expense ratios, high turnover, larger than average asset size, and a history of excess performance relative to the category average.

IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING HIGH POTENTIAL LEADERSHIP TALENT,"As a planner, you have choices to make as you approach retirement- an internal succession plan or a sale to a third party? The question we ask our clients should be the same question we should ask ourselves: Do you get better value selling to a partner or employee as part of your succession plan, or from a pool of qualified, competing peers who want what you have, as part of your transition plan? This article explains that succession planning is not a short-term strategy; it needs to start at least 5 years before the execution of the plan. This shouldn't be a problem for an industry of professional planners, but ironically, it requires planning that too often doesn't occur. This failure to plan is more an issue of the lack of planning tools than negligence. The tools provided in this article are applicable to your own transition plan and that of your clients.

THEORIES OF THE FINANCIAL PLANNING PROFESSION,"Although it appears that a theoretical body of knowledge for the Financial Planning Profession has always existed, until recently theory was not often explored as such, and there was no written common understanding or agreement on the theoretical basis of the financial planning profession. A survey of the financial planning literature over the past 50 years was performed, and certain basic theories from many existing disciplines were identified, although their application in personal financial planning has sometimes resulted in modifications. The theories identified from the literature were compared with the financial planning educational topics list of the CFP Board of Standards and the core financial planning process was explored in detail. A definition of financial planning as values and goals-driven strategic management of the client's financial resources was fashioned and the financial planning process as the strategic planning process applied to the financial and economic resources of the person or family was also defined.

HEALTH INSURANCE AND PERSONAL FINANCE: COVERAGE MATTERS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES,"Health insurance coverage is an essential component of a financial risk management strategy. Seminal theoretical perspectives regarding the consumer decision to obtain insurance have informed research into the causes and consequences of being uninsured. This paper reviews the empirical evidence from a rational choice perspective. Research suggests that being uninsured is associated with greater difficulty accessing medical services and a higher probability of choosing to delay or go without needed medical care. In addition, being uninsured is correlated with higher reports of other financial difficulties including being unable to pay for housing, transportation, and food. In some instances, families have needed to file for bankruptcy as a result of unmanageable medical expenses. This review shows that researchers, financial advisors, and consumers can all benefit from a better understanding of the complex array of private, public, and self insurance options available, as well as the consequences of being uninsured and the role health insurance plays in both improving health and managing financial risk.

The review of the literature indicates the importance of an educated consumer, and therefore it is essential that financial research continues to identify and provide guidance on optimal mortgage decisions and that consumers receive appropriate advice to navigate this potential financial hazard.

RETIREMENT SAVINGS ADEQUACY FOR THE BABY BOOM GENERATION,"This article provides financial practitioners and scholars with an overview of retirement preparedness in the U.S. along with recommendations for improving retirement security for Americans. The focus is on the 78 million baby boomers but contains implications for subsequent generations. Despite evidence of a retirement funding crisis, some researchers conclude the problem is overblown. Researchers differ on how to measure retirement income adequacy, whether to include and how to project health care expenses, and the role of housing equity, but agree on the groups most at risk. The consensus is that only half of baby boomers are financially prepared for retirement; one-fourth face challenges and the remaining one-fourth are at risk of poverty. Online retirement planning calculators and some studies may provide an overly optimistic picture of the boomer's future. Retirees will need assistance in managing their assets during retirement.

HUMAN CHOICE AND THE EMERGING FIELD OF NEUROECONOMICS: A REVIEW OF BRAIN SCIENCE FOR THE FINANCIAL PLANNER,"The emerging field of neuroeconomics combines the tools of neurology and microeconomics to uncover the neural substrates associated with economic decisions. Neuroeconomics represents a step beyond behavioral economics in that it promises to identify the physiological causes underlying deviations from neo-classical utility maximizing behavior. Several examples of widespread non-optimizing investment and risk management behaviors are found to have their origins in the mechanics of neural processes. Incorporating findings from this and related fields can aid financial planners in understanding, anticipating, and influencing client decision processes, and ultimately allow planners to develop frameworks that enhance the opportunity for client success.

CALCULATING A SUSTAINABLE WITHDRAWAL RATE: A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW,"Current trends in retirement savings exhibit a movement away from traditional employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution plans. Of great issue to retirees and financial planners is the answer to the question, ""how much can be withdrawn from a retirement account throughout retirement without running out of money?"" This article reviews the literature regarding the determination of a sustainable withdrawal rate. Past research has determined the answer to be a real return between 4% and 6% of the initial retirement portfolio. The 2% range is a function of numerous factors, including years in retirement, probability of running out of money, rate of consumption during retirement, allocation of assets, willingness to plan on interim adjustments and methodology of calculations.

"THE HISTORICAL RETIREMENT INCOME PROJECTOR MODEL - UPDATED, UPGRADED, AND MORE ACCESSIBLE","This article presents a more accessible and enhanced revision of a retirement income projector model which uses actual (not average) yearly historical returns (Everett, 1995; Everett &amp; Anthony, 2002). This allows users to test drive different portfolio strategies over different historical time periods and evaluate the outcomes. The program builds existing retirement assets and new savings up until retirement, then during retirement the model takes out enough accumulated assets to supplement other retirement income sources to meet target retirement income. The authors converted the program to a widely accessible spreadsheet software (Excel(TM)) and upgraded the program to consider increased medical costs and decreased Social Security benefits during retirement. The revised model also incorporates easy-to-read output charts and updated asset returns data through 2005. Financial advisors and laypersons with basic Excel(TM) spreadsheet skills should find this model useful for analyzing individual risk-return tradeoffs for long-term retirement portfolios using different investment strategies.

EDITOR'S NOTES,"The recent news that Congress may actually make progress later this year to permanently reform the estate tax exemption likely drew a collective sigh of relief from many financial advisors, attorneys and clients. Many would agree that the projected exemption of $3.5 million per individual and $7 million for a married couple with a 45% top rate is a very workable compromise. However, should that proposal actually become law, it does not change the significance of estate planning issues within the scope of comprehensive financial planning, or more importantly within the scope of financial life planning. Ethical wills may be the needed bridge between failure to take any action to a personal acceptance of immortality and the need for planning to protect the interests of self and others. Ethical wills may, for some clients, serve as the first step between taking no estate planning action and being committed to accomplishing the broader objectives of estate planning.",Anonymous, Editorial,,2008,Journal of Personal Finance," Reforms , Personal finance , Tax exemptions , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
TEN HEALTH FINANCE TOPICS THAT FINANCIAL PLANNERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND,"Health and personal finances are strongly related. In recent years, health care costs have consumed an increasingly larger share of household income. Even those with ""good health insurance"" are paying more out-of-pocket for premiums, co-payments, and deductibles than they were a decade ago. Health-care expenses force trade-offs in spending and affect financial decisions (e.g., job choices and retirement date). Dollars spent on medical expenses are also unavailable to invest for financial goals such as retirement. This article examines ten health finance topics that financial planners need to understand: 1. financial stress related to health care costs, 2. consumer driven health care, 3. health savings accounts, 4. the COBRA and HIPAA laws, 5. retiree health insurance and Medicare, 6. young adult health insurance, 7. state health insurance laws and benefit programs, 8. the financial cost of unhealthy behaviors, 9. primary and secondary health care expenses, and 10. health and wealth relationships.

CREDIT CARD DEBT REDUCTION AND DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES OF THE LIFESPAN,Credit card debt is a large and growing problem among American consumers. Few studies have focused on barriers to getting out of debt or helping consumers change their behaviors. The current study examined the link between theory-based developmental stages of the lifespan and factors associated with troubling debt and change. Results are based on survey responses of 263 participants ages 20 to 85. Stages of the lifespan were linked to differences in worry about credit card debt and the confidence participants felt in their ability to get out of debt. Results are linked to suggestions for how financial counselors or advisors can assist clients in paying down credit card debt.

A BULL CALL SPREAD AS A STRATEGY FOR SMALL INVESTORS?,"As options trading has drawn attention from investors as a viable choice for investment, numerous books have been written, many different software programs have been developed, and quite a few websites have been designed to educate and attract potential investors to options.

Using the call options on the Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, this study investigates whether so-called easy strategies, such as bull call spreads, work for ordinary investors. The results show that a bull call spread is hardly profitable for ordinary investors, confirming that options trading is truly risky.

3 DIMENSIONAL ALPHA: VALUE ADDED,"Wealth management is more than money management. Financial, personal, and social wealth comprise one's total wealth. If each dimension of wealth has a value, then preserving and protecting each becomes an important part of the total wealth-management process. When an advisor can add value and synchronize all three dimensions, the advisor's value is not simply geometrically increased, it is exponentially amplified. This holistic advisor significantly reduces the prospect for being replaced as a result of his or her investment performance results. The 3D Wealth Client Demand Survey is conducted electronically and consists of 30 comparative multiple-choice items and one free-response item. Using a survey that is structured this way, the client can indicate priorities accurately by making like comparisons across all three dimensions. Advisors are less reliant on a sales pitch and a first impression when they have a rating to set them apart. The practitioner ratings also can point out areas where professional growth is required.","Diefendorf, Monroe M, Jr, MI, CLU, ChFC, CFP, RFC, C;Donovan, Jeremy P", Feature,,2008,Journal of Personal Finance," PSYCHOLOGY , Wealth management , Value added , Advisors , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Consistency Smile: How Consistency of Investment Decisions Relates to Risk Appetite,"Using the Kahneman and Tversky (1979) definition of risky gambles, consistency of decision-making is defined as selecting the ""same"" gamble, regardless of how the gamble is presented. Both expected utility theory (EUT) and prospect theory (PT) make implicit assumptions about the consistency of individual behavior as it pertains to risky gambles that are not borne out in laboratory tests. EUT assumes that individuals are perfectly rational and implicitly consistent in their decisions, whereas, PT implicitly concludes that, in the aggregate, there is zero consistency. This paper develops a new methodology to examine consistency in risky gambles and tests it on a diverse database of 442 people -- investment professionals (81), teens (297), and adult non-professionals (64) - to account for factors like literacy, experience, age, and gender. First, consistency of individuals and groups lies well between levels assumed by EUT and PT. Second, using the Risktyle model to calibrate the strength of risk preferences for Kahneman-Tversky gambles, we discover a ""Consistency Smile"" - individuals with strong risk preferences, across all but one of the sub-groups, tend to have greater consistency in decisions than those with weaker risk preferences. Third, non-investment professionals have the highest level of consistency followed by teens, and investment professionals. This result has interesting investing implications, especially for advisors designing portfolios for a diverse group of clients.","Muralidhar, Sidharth", Journal Article,,2018,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Decision making , Investment , Risk aversion , Expected utility",ProQuest One Academic

"Post-Retirement Spending Discomfort and the Role of Preparedness, Preferences, and Expectations","There is much debate about the retirement preparedness of Americans. Despite the debate, many recent studies have found that Americans spend very conservatively in retirement, and in many cases continue to save. Using proprietary data from a survey on retirement risk tolerance, this study explored explanations for such conservative attitudes towards spending. Perceived preparedness, preferences for risk and spending, and expectations for medical costs and longevity were considered. Perceived preparedness and preferences for risk and spending showed consistently strong relationships with spending discomfort, while income, wealth, and estimated longevity were not significant. Better understanding the retirement spending concerns of individuals will help the retirement planning industry improve the framing and structure of retirement products and develop income plans that result in more optimal spending patterns.","Browning, Christopher M", Journal Article,,2018,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Expenditures , Expectations , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The results indicate no clear dominance for one structure over the other; however, the defined contribution plan appears to be well suited for employees who consider shorter employment tenures with an institution. Employees, in general, should find it beneficial to be offered the choice of both structures, with the ability to choose one or the other, depending on one's expected longevity with the employer and personal risk tolerance.","Cumbie, Julie, PhD;Ice, Randal, EdD;Krishnan, V Sivarama, PhD", Journal Article,,2018,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Defined benefit plans , Employees , Employment , Defined contribution plans , Rates of return , Pension plans",ProQuest One Academic
Creating Understanding and Interest in Charitable Financial and Estate Planning: An Experimental Test of Introductory Phrases,"Charitable financial planning is an important and growing segment of personal financial planning. However, client understanding and interest in learning more about such topics can vary substantially depending on the language used to introduce the topics. This paper reports results from a series of experiments investigating the effectiveness of different phrasing in generating understanding and interest in learning more regarding ""planned giving,"" ""estate giving,"" ""estate planning,"" and ""charitable gift annuities."" Results support the proposition that using these standard industry terms to introduce such information reduces both understanding and interest in learning more as compared with simple functional descriptions, such as ""other ways to give,"" ""gifts in wills,"" ""will planning,"" and ""gifts that pay you income."" Although formal industry terminology may be technically correct, it can also be detrimental to client understanding and interest in learning more about such topics.","James, Russell N, III, PhD, JD, CFP®", Journal Article,,2018,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Financial planning , Donations , Estate planning , Annuities",ProQuest One Academic

Why Financial Advisors Have Yet to Leave the Professionalism Bar,"More than 650,000 financial advisors help manage over $30 trillion, with nearly 90% of consumers with investments over $100,000 seeking help. Widespread fraud and misconduct is a longstanding problem, but has not undergone rigorous investigation and analysis. Some 7% of securities salespeople show documented misconduct, with a propensity for repeat misconduct unlike in medicine where malpractice is more random. Advisors with misconduct tend to concentrate at firms whose cultures may enable it. The cost to consumers and society from poor advice is not yet known, but estimated to waste some $17 billion per year of consumer savings. Unlike professions such as law, medicine, and accounting, the advisory profession has significant variations in ethical duties, regulatory oversight, consumer protections, and applicable education. While financial planning is ostensibly overseen by the Securities Exchange Commission or its state analogs, insurance and investment products, tax, retirement planning, estate and retirement planning, and other functions fall to a patchwork of regulation with wide gaps, and in many cases, little or no effective regulation.","Camarda, Jeffrey M, PhD, CFA, EA", Journal Article,,2018,Journal of Personal Finance," Fraud , Studies , Consumers , Retirement planning , Advisors , Financial planners , Professional misconduct",ProQuest One Academic
Recognizing Conflicts of Interest in Financial Planning: A Sequential Study,"Conflicts of interest (COI) are an important issue for financial planners. This study is sequential to a prior study, providing improved sample uniformity and focus. The emphasis is upon measuring the recognition of COI by CFP® certificants in financial planning practice. Recognition was measured in six pending financial planning engagements. Participants were 134 CFP® certificants in financial planning practice. To measure recognition of COI in each engagement, participants were asked the likelihood the financial planner would encounter a COI by accepting each engagement. Participant recognition of COI aligned with expectations in 4 of the 6 engagements, but did not align when considering a family member or business associate as a client. Time in financial planning practice and number of professional designations were measured as possible influence factors on the planner's recognition of COI, and found to have insignificant influence.","Bearden, Frank C, PhD", Journal Article,,2018,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Financial planning , Conflicts of interest , Business ethics , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic
The Behaviorally-Enlightened Fiduciary: Addressing Moral Dilemmas through a Decision-Theoretic Model of Moral Value Judgment,"A fiduciary has an ethical obligation to act in the best interests of her client. In this paper, I argue that this obligation demands that a fiduciary advise her client from a behaviorally-informed perspective. However, this obligation creates new moral dilemmas, complicating ex-ante determination and ex-post evaluation of the fulfillment of fiduciary duties. I argue that a prima facie duty of disclosure may only be overridden when the potential upside of the non-disclosed option to the beneficiary is small, the potential downside of the non-disclosed option to the beneficiary is large, and the fiduciary is epistemically justified in her beliefs regarding the potential outcomes. I present a decision-theoretic model for evaluating these dilemmas, as well as practical guidance for fiduciaries facing these trade-offs.","Tharp, Derek, PhD", Journal Article,,2018,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Business ethics , Fiduciaries , Decision theory , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

"The Charitable Bequest Gap Among African-Americans: Exploring Charitable, Religious, and Family Estate Planning Attitudes","Previous research reports that African-Americans are significantly less likely than Whites to have a charitable estate plan, even when controlling for other socio-economic characteristics. Two possible explanations are a documentation barrier or lack of charitable intent. Evidence for a documentation barrier includes relatively lower engagement with the formal financial system in general. The evidence further indicates that, among those who have estate planning documents, African-Americans are not less likely to include a charitable component. Using nationally representative data from the 2007 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (n=8,289), we present direct evidence of attitudes regarding charitable, religious, and family estate planning. In absolute terms, African-Americans rated the importance of charitable and religious bequest gifts higher than others did. This suggests a documentation barrier -- a barrier that advisors can actively address -- rather than a lack of charitable intent. Additionally, consistent with theories and findings in current charitable giving, African-Americans were also more likely to give religious bequests greater importance relative to other charitable or family bequests.","Lehman, Jennifer, JD;James, Russell N, III, JD, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,,2018,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , African Americans , Socioeconomic factors , Charities , Donations , Estate planning , Religion , Documentation",ProQuest One Academic
Do Interest-Only Mortgages Really Make Sense for Investors?,"Interest-only mortgages began as a way for well-qualified borrowers to reduce their monthly mortgage payment and increase their available funds for investment. However, during the financial crisis, these loans were viewed as one of the factors precipitating the mortgage problems as borrowers had instead used them as a way to qualify for larger loans. While this paper will not debate the merits of how interest-only mortgages are used, we will try to determine if their original intent is reasonable. This paper attempts to analyze how easily an investor can earn returns that ""beat"" mortgage rates. Specifically, we use portfolio return simulations with the historical return characteristics of various assets and mortgage rates to determine the probability of various ""typical"" investment portfolios earning returns that exceed mortgage interest rates. Not surprisingly, our results show that the probability of successfully employing this strategy is often less than 15 percent, and increasing the probability of success requires large increases in risk.","Chittenden, William T;Lesseig, Vance P;Moon, Kenneth P", Journal Article,,2018,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Probability , Payments , Interest-only loans , Portfolio investments , Mortgage rates",ProQuest One Academic

Why A QLAC in an IRA Is a Terrible Way to Defer the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) Obligation,"The longevity annuity has become increasingly popular in recent years as a potential new vehicle for retirement income, as its ability to delay payments to an advanced age like 85 allows for a significant accumulation of mortality credits. And since the introduction of Treasury Regulations in 2014, a so-called ""qualified longevity annuity contract"" (QLAC) can even be purchased inside of an IRA or other retirement account, allowing a portion of a retiree's RMDs to be deferred from 70½ to as late as age 85. However, as it turns out the unique nature of a longevity annuity's payment structure is not very hospitable as an RMD deferral strategy. The fact that it can take until a retiree's late 80s just to break even and recover principal means the retiree risks significant forgone growth by trying to merely defer RMDs through the use of a QLAC. And of course, the RMDs will still eventually happen anyway, as the QLAC merely defers when payments begin. In fact, ironically, if the retiree does live, the accelerated payments of a QLAC in the later years can actually deplete an IRA even faster than normal IRA RMDs. Ultimately, this doesn't mean that the longevity annuity (or a QLAC inside an IRA) is a bad deal. The ability to accumulate mortality credits still means it can be very eff ective as a fi xed income alternative for those who fear they may not have enough money to fund a retirement well beyond their life expectancy. And if a retiree intends to spend all of his/her assets anyway, and the only available dollars for retirement are held in an IRA or other retirement account, the QLAC is an effective means to engage in such a strategy. Nonetheless, the bottom line is that while a QLAC may be a valid way to use a retirement account to hedge against longevity -- and defer RMDs along the way -- it's still not very effective as an RMD avoidance or deferral strategy. Just because you can buy a longevity annuity inside a retirement account as a QLAC doesn't mean you should.","Kitces, Michael E, MSFS, MTAX, CFP®, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC, CASL", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Distribution of retirement plan assets , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Retirees , Annuities , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Life Quality and Health Costs in Late Retirement,"Individuals are living longer due to the advancement of medical technology and nutrition quality. Are the elderly enjoying retirement in those extended years with good quality of life or are they simply alive? Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS), this study contributes to the literature by presenting empirical evidence on how individuals spend time in retirement. The results show that retirees on average do not spend their time significantly different throughout retirement. Most life tasks such as reading the paper or magazines, listening to music, playing sports or exercising, visiting others, and house cleaning are similar among retirees in different age groups. We also present evidence that retirees on average experience a spike in medical expenses late in retirement. We compare systematic withdrawal strategies with and without health costs risk quantifying the impact on portfolio sustainability.","Cheng, Yuanshan, PhD;Gibson, Philip, PhD;Guo, Tao, PhD", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Quality of life , Health care expenditures , Retirees , Portfolio management , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

We find a positive effect of having one or more saving rules on the likelihood of saving, and weak effects of having retirement as a saving goal and of having children/family as a saving goal on saving. However, it is not clear that the measures of self-control reported in previous research really provide useful ways to increase the likelihood of saving.

What's Your Risk Appetite? Helping Financial Advisors Better Serve Clients (by Quantifying Kahneman-Tversky's Value Function),"This paper presents a methodology to allow advisors to quantify risk tolerance of clients, over gains and losses, based on the Kahneman-Tversky survey. Once a formal and quantitative estimate of an individual's risk appetite can be determined, and its evolution tracked over time, advisors can design effective investment portfolios to cater to the client's specific risk tolerance. The paper extends this individual-level risk diagnostic and applies it over various subgroups and demonstrates that (a) teens are more risk-seeking than adults when it pertains to losses; (b) among investment professionals, women are more conservative than men when it pertains to gains; and (c) even within these subgroups, every individual is unique and neither expected utility theory nor prospect theory appropriately capture the diversity in risk tolerance. This paper seeks to make Kahneman-Tversky's research on prospect theory/behavioral economics, and their value function practical and user-friendly, thus improving investment decision making.","Muralidhar, Sid;Berlik, Emerson", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Models , Risk aversion , Portfolio investments , Expected utility , Advisors , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic
The Impact of Product Knowledge and Quality of Care on Long-term Care Insurance Demand: Evidence from the HRS,"Using a unique module in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), this paper considers three important factors that may infl uence consumer demand for long-term care insurance (LTCI): preference for high quality care, potential costs, and knowledge. In addition, this paper proposes a new method for examining insurance demand. Only those individuals who are considering purchasing LTCI in the near future (who don't currently own a LTCI policy) are included in the analysis. By focusing on this group, this paper attempts to determine the factors that are most relevant to the LTCI purchase decision when the consumer is most heavily considering it. Our findings imply that consumers deeply care about the provision for high quality long-term care, and suggest that widespread informational deficiencies currently suppress the demand for private long-term care insurance.","Lumby, Jacob;Browning, Christopher, PhD;Finke, Michael S, PhD", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Long term care insurance , Impact analysis , Quality of care , Knowledge , Demand , Long term health care",ProQuest One Academic
Is Deferring Social Security the Lowest Cost Option for Adding Guaranteed Income?,"When to claim Social Security is one of many retirement decisions that should be considered together as part of a comprehensive retirement income plan. A good retirement income plan addresses the retiree's financial objectives as well as the large number of risks and contingencies faced in retirement. As some financial goals are more important than others, a common planning approach is to build an income floor with low-risk sources of income to ensure resources are always available to meet essential expenses of food, shelter, clothing, transportation and medical care. Social Security is the foundation of the income floor for most households. In the past, many retirees also had monthly income from a defined-benefit pension. Together with Social Security, the pension created a generous income floor. But defined-benefit pensions have been on the decline. From 1979 to 2013, the percentage of private-sector workers participating in a pension plan plummeted from 38% to 13%, in contrast the percentages for defined-contribution plans jumped from 17% to 44%.","Littell, David A, JD, ChFC;Okumura, Kirk S, MSFS, ChFC", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Research , Retirement plans , Income , Social security , Pension plans , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Risk Tolerance and Goals-Based Savings Behavior of Households: The Role of Financial Literacy,"This study uses a national dataset to examine the association among risk tolerance, financial literacy, and goals-based savings behavior of households. The results indicate that three out of five households do not have any emergency funds set aside, and about half the households have not calculated how much money they will need for retirement. However, both financial literacy and risk tolerance are associated with goals-based savings behavior, such as saving for emergencies, and planning for retirement among households. Although risk tolerance appears to be an important factor in the savings and investment decisions of households, the findings of this study provide further evidence regarding the role of financial literacy in improving household financial capability. Implications for policy makers, scholars, and researchers in the area of behavioral economics and household finance are included.","Chatterjee, Swarn;Fan, Lu;Jacobs, Ben;Haas, Robin", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Finance , Households , Financial literacy , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic

The Impact of Rates of Return on Roth Conversion Decisions and Retiree Savings Wealth,"A tax-optimal retirement savings withdrawal model, implemented as a linear programming application, is used to compare savings wealth growth when Roth conversions are permitted (RC) and when they are not (NoRC). Evaluations are made for combinations of percentage rates of return (ROR) for taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free savings. PctDiff , the difference between tax-free and tax-deferred (TD) account RORs, is an important conversion consideration. When investment strategies target PctDiff s at two percent or greater, RC provides substantial benefits. As PctDiff increases, the percentage of initial TD savings that should be converted rises, the time to recover savings wealth lost to conversion-related taxes declines, and savings wealth growth surges. When PctDiff is less than two percent, savings wealth growth is small and savings wealth loss due to conversion-generated taxes persists for more than 13 years; retiree health and prospects of living long enough to realize savings wealth gains becomes a vital concern. Conversions are best made relatively early in retirement and at varying annual amounts.","Coopersmith, Lewis, PhD;Sumutka, Alan R, MBA, CPA, CGMA", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Impact analysis , Investment policy , Savings , Rates of return , Linear programming , Conversion , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic
Do Financial Advisers Follow Their Own Advice? Evidence from 2008–2011,"Consistent with previous literature, we find that financial advisors' trade recommendations do not outperform the trades that are independently initiated by their clients. At best, their recommendations outperform their clients' selections in the short-term, but still underperform the market. What is unknown in the literature is whether it is misaligned sales incentives that cause advisors to give their clients suboptimal advice. Using transaction-level data from a U.S. brokerage firm, we compare financial advisors' personal trades to their clients. We find that financial advisors do not outperform their clients, suggesting that advisors are giving clients their best advice which they, too, follow.","Outlaw, Dominique Gehy, PhD;Outlaw, Jesse, CPA", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Personal finance , Incentives , Advisors , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

However, we find a strong relationship between the level of financial knowledge and savings behavior.

The Home as a Risky Asset,"Despite being one of the most valuable assets in the world and one of the largest assets on many household balance sheets, real estate -- in the form of homeownership -- presents considerable risks that are generally poorly understood. Through an analysis, we find significant homeownership risks that are primarily idiosyncratic (i.e., not market-related), driven largely by the illiquid nature of owning a single home. We find the risk of homes is approximately double that of city-specific home price indexes (e.g., the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Indices), with an annual standard deviation of 12%, which is approximately equivalent to the historical volatility of a portfolio invested in 60% stocks and 40% Treasury bills. While the return on house price indexes has exceeded inflation historically (with a real return of approximately ~1%), the actual real return realized by homeowners, after considering the various costs associated with owning and selling a home, has likely been negative in real terms. Renting is often a better option for many households, especially those households with lower marginal tax rates (i.e., households that do not itemize deductions) and have shorter expected housing durations. We note significant differences in the returns, volatility, and market risk of homes and REITs; these differences suggest REITs are a relatively poor proxy for residential real estate from an investment perspective. We also identify the factors, such as home price, county unemployment rate, housing turnover, home size, and even average annual temperature, that can differ by region and are strongly related to the returns, volatility and market risk of homeownership. Many households may use this factor information to better approximate the risk of their homes. Overall, the impact of owning a home on the optimal total wealth financial portfolio is likely to vary significantly by household, based on the unique risks associated with the home, household wealth, and other non-financial household assets.","Blanchett, David, PhD, CFA, CFP", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Standard deviation , Home ownership , Inflation , Price indexes , REITs , Housing prices , Volatility , Households , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Preventing Financial Elder Abuse,"Clients may not only need a financial planner's help and advice when it comes to their finances -- they may also need their protection as well. Because billions of dollars are financially exploited each year, planners and financial service institutions are increasingly being called upon to walk the tightrope between a client's autonomy and a client's need to be safeguarded. In order for the financial planner to better serve his clients we first look at the financial elder abuse problem and share examples, which highlight the scope of the issue. We then point out some red flags that will alert financial planners to a potential problem. We examine the legal requirements and protections that are germane to understanding the financial planner's responsibility in recognizing and preventing financial elder abuse. We review actions the financial planner can take to cope with or prevent financial elder abuse. And finally, we discuss a systematic response that an organization should take to create a business culture that seriously addresses financial elder abuse.","Tacchino, Kenn Beam, JD, LLM, RICP", Journal Article,,2017,Journal of Personal Finance," Adult abuse & neglect , Corporate culture , Personal finance , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Competing Risks: Death and Ruin,"Early portfolio survival research in the field of retirement finance largely focused on the probability of outliving one's retirement portfolio with constant spending over fixed time periods, such as 30 years. Seminal studies by William Bengen, for example, suggested that a retiree can invest his or her savings in a portfolio of stocks and bonds and spend around 4% of his or her initial savings balance annually from the portfolio with about a 5% probability of outliving those savings. Subsequent work by Stout and Mitchell and later by Milevsky and Robinson incorporated random lifetimes, but focused on the lifetime probability of ruin. Medical research uses methods of analyzing survival studies that are novel in retirement research. We use Kaplan-Meier estimates and competing risks analysis to explore the conditional probability of a retiree outliving her savings as age progresses, the relationship of the competing risks of death and ruin as age progresses, and the timing of portfolio failures due to poor market returns. We find that risk of ruin develops in three stages of a long retirement: a low-risk period early in retirement with high sensitivity to market returns but few portfolio failures, a middle period in which portfolio failure peaks, and a late period in which death is much more likely than portfolio ruin.","Cotton, Dirk, MBA;Cotton, Cary, MD, MPH;Mears, Alex, BS", Feature,,2016,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Probability , Retirement planning , Portfolio management , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Evaluating Financial Planning Strategies and Quantifying Their Economic Impact,"Most research on the value of financial advice has focused primarily on how advisors add value around a portfolio. Ultimately, though, financial advice can impact a wide range of areas from income and estate tax planning to insurance planning (where the expected value is typically negative in absolute terms, but an improvement in risk reduction), and more. In some cases, the ""value"" of financial planning is in the eye of the beholder -- based on how the client values his/her own time relative to paying for the advisor. When comparing two financial planning strategies to each other, it's feasible to compare the outcomes and decide which is best. Trying to assess the value of financial planning advice in the abstract, though, is much harder because of the ""compared to what"" problem. It's not always clear exactly how any particular client would have behaved in the absence of the advice (since that future never actually happened), which makes it impossible to measure whether or how the advice actually changed the outcome. In a world where ultimately most financial planning strategies ""could"" be implemented by a consumer themselves -- given sufficient education, time, and an inclination to get it done -- arguably the greatest value a financial planner provides is the behavioral coaching and support to ensure the recommendations are actually implemented. Unfortunately, the financial impact of this is virtually impossible to measure, given the uncertainty of how a prospective client might have behaved in the future without an advisor. Nonetheless, it is essential to recognize that the economic impact of financial planning is not merely the strategy itself, but its implementation, too. This article projects the potential economic impacts of various financial planning strategies.","Kitces, Michael E, MSFS, MTAX, CFP®, CLU, ChFC, R", Feature,,2016,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Financial planning , Impact analysis , Economic impact , Advisors , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

In this investigation, college students in the United States (n = 346) and Mexico (n = 345) reported their attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs regarding an array of psychological variables related to financial planning for retirement. We cast the data into two theoretically-based path models -- one for each country -- and then compared the results. Both models accounted for appreciable variance in expectations of future financial planning. Although models for both groups were structurally similar, path coefficients revealed important cross-national differences in the psychological factors that underlie anticipated future saving practices.

Gauging America's Retirement Income Planning Literacy: A Method for Determining Retirement Knowledgeable Clients,"Although significant amounts of research and public policy have been directed toward financial literacy in recent years, not nearly as much attention has been placed on the type of information needed by the nearly 10,000 Baby Boomers reaching age 65 each day until 2030. As such, it would be wise not to lose focus on an important literacy measurement: retirement income planning knowledge. The reality is that retirement income planning is challenging, as it requires knowledge across a broad array of legal, financial, and social topics. To make informed retirement income planning decisions, retirees will require an appropriate level of retirement income planning knowledge. This article discusses the findings of The American College RICP Retirement Income Literacy Survey, which was used to gather information about the retirement income planning knowledge of those individuals just entering retirement and those individuals about to retire. Additionally, this article presents the top distinguisher questions that can be used by retirement advisors to gauge the retirement income knowledge of their clients.","Hopkins, Jamie, JD, MBA, LLM, CLU®, ChFC®, RIC;Littell, David A, JD, ChFC®", Feature,,2016,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , EDUCATION , Financial literacy , Income , Retirement planning , Baby boomers , PSYCHOLOGY , Retirement income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Reverse Mortgages, Annuities, and Investments: Sorting Out the Options to Generate Sustainable Retirement Income","This study examines the improvements in sustainable retirement income that can be generated by utilizing either of two options under the HECM reverse mortgage program -- the tenure option and line of credit (LOC). For comparison, the study also analyzes the impact of utilizing a single-premium immediate annuity (SPIA) to generate retirement income. The base case for these comparisons is a systematic withdrawal plan that does not use reverse mortgage or annuity options. The study also examines the impact of combining reverse mortgage options and SPIAs. The reverse mortgage tenure option was shown to be particularly attractive, generating more income than a SPIA purchased with the same financial commitment. The LOC option generated less income than tenure with average interest rates remaining level, but came close to tenure under the assumption of future higher rates. Tests were also run with higher stock allocations for the retirement savings and with increases in the amounts of SPIAs purchased. The reverse mortgage options are most attractive for those who do not need to hold onto home equity for either a bequest or late-in-life spending.","Tomlinson, Joseph, FSA, CFP®;Pfeiffer, Shaun, PhD, CFP®;Salter, John, PhD, CFP®, AIFA®", Feature,,2016,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Reverse mortgages , Income , Retirement planning , Annuities , EDUCATION , Retirement income , Lines of credit , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Measuring the Financial Consequences of IRA to Roth IRA Conversions,"The tax code permits the conversion of IRA funds to a Roth IRA provided that personal income taxes are paid on the IRA distributions. Common motivations for IRA to Roth IRA conversions are to increase retirement disposable income, insure against future tax increases, and allocate retirement savings to minimize combined taxes for retirees and their heirs. This paper quantitatively assesses the financial consequences of making conversions with respect to these motivations. Our laboratory was a linear programming retirement planning calculator that, given a set of assumptions and constraints, computes retirement cash flow that maximizes disposable income by minimizing taxes and maximizing compounded asset returns. Disposable income is our metric for evaluating different assumptions, such as doing or not doing conversions. Our results are that partial conversions early in the optimal plan increase disposable income by around 1 percent in most situations. Conversions reduce total income taxes paid by 19 percent as they shift taxes from later in retirement to early in retirement. Pre-positioning savings for inheritance purposes can be accomplished with minor reductions in disposable income.","Welch, James S, Jr", Feature,,2016,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Conversion , Roth IRAs , Personal income , Income taxes , Retirement planning , Tax increases , Linear programming , Retirement , Disposable income , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Simplifying RIA Oversight,"The SEC provides oversight to RIAs managing at least $100 million of Regulatory Assets under Management. The number of Registered Investment Advisors (RIA) managing these assets has increased significantly since 2004. In addition, the SEC has increased pressure to provide broader oversight of RIAs and Investment Advisor Representatives (IAR). Even the smaller firms are held to the same level of oversight, expense and reporting requirements as the large, very complex investment advisors who manage 96.4% of the assets. This paper identifies and explores five key areas the SEC has marked as the most probable areas of failure affecting the markets and consumers. If the SEC delegated oversight of these less complicated RIAs to trained, licensed and regulated compliance consultants, the SEC would reduce their regulatory workload and could refocus resources on larger firms which are susceptible to conflicts of interest and other compliance violations established in the 1940's Act.","Baker, Guy, PhD", Feature,,2015,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Regulatory agencies , Delegation , Small business , Investment advisors , Workloads , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Does Financial Sophistication Matter in Retirement Preparedness?,"Lack of financial sophistication has been suggested as a cause of retirement plan failure. We extend previous studies of retirement adequacy by testing the effect of financial sophistication proxies on projected retirement adequacy, using the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) dataset. We found that only 44% of households with a full-time head aged 35 to 60 are adequately prepared for retirement in 2010, compared to 58% in 2007. Our multivariate analysis shows that college educated households are more likely to have an adequate retirement than those with less than a high school degree. Households using a financial planner are more likely to have an adequate retirement than those that do not use one.","Kim, Kyoung Tae, PhD;Hanna, Sherman D, PhD", Feature,,2015,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Multivariate analysis , Households , Educational attainment , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Financial Planning Research Needs-A Practitioner's View,"We need a stronger connection between the community of financial planners and those doing research to support financial planning practice, particularly those in the academic world. Research can support changes and refinements in financial planning practice, the development of new investment and insurance products to better meet client needs, and improvements in financial planning software. In this article I highlight a number of different areas where research can add significant value.

A Quantitative Evaluation of Four Retirement Spending Models,"Traditional retirement planning assumes that disposable income is constant throughout retirement, before it is indexed to inflation. Demographic retirement spending data indicate that retirees spend more early in retirement, while they are physically active, and voluntarily spend less later in retirement. Four researchers reviewed retiree demographic spending data and proposed retirement spending models which fit their observations. We added these spending models to a linear programming based retirement calculator that computes maximum disposable income for the first year of retirement and applies a spending model to the remainder of retirement. We defined a base scenario and examined how the spending models behaved compared with the traditional constant spending model and with each other. We ran a series of tests to observe how the spending models perform when an assumption of the base scenario was perturbed. We conclude that a retiree may safely choose higher spending early in retirement while budgeting for lower disposable income later in retirement.","Welch, James S, Jr", Feature,,2015,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Demographics , Linear programming , Consumer spending , Budgets , Personal finance , Retirees , Retirement , Disposable income",ProQuest One Academic

What Do Subjective Assessments of Financial Well-Being Reflect?,"Households have become increasingly responsible for meeting distant financial needs -- specifically paying down student loans, saving for retirement, and saving for college. This study, using data from the 2012 FINRA Foundation Financial Capability Survey, nevertheless finds that a household's financial satisfaction is highly correlated with its ability to meet its day-to-day needs, with much more muted relationships with its protection against risk and accumulation of savings to meet future needs. Nor do subjective assessments become much more sensitive to distant deficits if the household's day-to-day finances are in reasonably good shape or if assessment is made by a financially literate individual. Households thus cannot be expected to devote much effort to addressing distant deficits by themselves. They need initiatives that raise their awareness of distant financial deficits, such as broadcasting simple rules-of-thumb and providing ready access to quick financial check-ups; and compensate for their on-going lack of awareness, such as structures that make it easy and automatic to address such deficits.","Sass, Steven A, PhD;Belbase, Anek, MPA;Cooperrider, Thomas;Ramos-Mercado, Jorge D", Feature,,2015,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Family income , Financial literacy , Personal finance , Households , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Which Assets to Leave to Heirs and Related Issues,"Many retirees have funds in several savings vehicles including taxable accounts, tax-deferred accounts (TDAs) like a traditional IRA, and tax-exempt accounts (TEAs) like a Roth IRA. In this study, we address several questions. For simplicity, we assume the retiree is a widow, but the same considerations apply to a widower and a retired couple. Assume the widow has funds in a tax-deferred account and a tax-exempt account. The first question is: Should she spend the money in the TDA and leave the TEA to her beneficiary child, or vice versa? The second question is: If this widow has multiple children who will inherit the remaining funds and these children have different tax rates, how can she tax-efficiently split the TDAs and TEAs to maximize the after-tax value of these accounts for her children? Third: When should the widow convert funds from the TDA to a TEA? Finally, whether the beneficiary(ies) inherit TDAs or TEAs or some combination of each, the widow should make sure she has taken the steps to ensure that they will be able to stretch distributions from the inherited IRAs over their remaining lifetime(s). Based on the work of Slott (2012), we explain what steps the widow should take now to make sure the IRAs can be stretched. In the next section, we explain how funds in TDAs are best viewed as partnerships with the government. This framework will prove useful when answering these questions.","Potts, Tom L, PhD, CFP®;Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA", Feature,,2015,Journal of Personal Finance," Widows & widowers , Tax rates , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Tax deferred privileges , Beneficiaries , Retirement planning , Tax exempt , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Life And Death Tax Planning For Deferred Annuities,"The concept of the annuity -- a stream of income that will be paid for life -- has been around for almost two millennia, and in the US for nearly 200 years now. Annuities became far more popular in the past century or so, though, due to both rising longevity that creates longer retirement periods which need to be funded, and significant tax preferences established in the Internal Revenue Code to incentivize the use of annuities as a vehicle for retirement accumulation (and subsequent decumulation). This article explores the tax implications of deferred annuities in detail.","Kitces, Michael E, MSFS, MTAX, CFP®, CLU, ChFC, R", Feature,,2015,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Tax planning , Death benefits , Annuities , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Greatest Wealth is Health: Relationships between Health and Financial Behaviors,"Financial advisors are encouraged to consider their clients' health and personal finances holistically. Strengths and challenges in one area of a client's life often affect the other. Like culture, health status is another ""lens"" with which to assess clients' values, goals, plans, personality traits, and lifestyle. This article was written to increase advisors' understanding of relationships between health and financial practices. When advisors understand a client's personality traits and projected state of future health, they can provide more comprehensive, targeted advice instead of giving the same advice to clients in different situations. The article begins with a review of recent literature and describes two personality factors found to be associated with positive health and financial behaviors: conscientiousness and time preference. Next, it previews a new online tool to self-assess the frequency of performance of recommended health and financial practices. It concludes with a summary and implications for financial planning practice.","O'Neill, Barbara, PhD, CFP®, CRPC, AFC, CHC, CFE", Feature,,2015,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Health , Correlation analysis , Personality traits , Personal finance , Advisors , Personality , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Exploring the Antecedents of Financial Behavior for Asians and Non-Hispanic Whites: The Role of Financial Capability and Locus of Control,"Using data collected over a three-year time span (2008 through 2011), this paper examines the association between racial background and financial behavior. This study specifically evaluated differences between Asians and non-Hispanic Whites living in the United States (N = 341). Findings from this research suggest that any racial differences in financial behavior appear to exist only in a two variable correlational sense. Both financial capability and locus of control act as mediators between race and financial behavior. In general, those with high financial capability tend to exhibit better financial behavior. Additionally, individuals who exhibit an internal locus of control perspective also report better financial behavior. Age was also found to be positively associated with better financial behavior. When these factors were controlled for in a multivariate analysis, no meaningful racial differences were noted in this study.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP®;Joo, So-Hyun, PhD;Park, Jooyung, PhD", Feature,,2015,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Correlation analysis , Financial planning , Racial differences , Consumer behavior , White people , Asian people , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Mitigating the Impact of Personal Income Taxes on Retirement Savings Distributions,"When retirement savings include a large tax-deferred account distribution strategies for sequencing withdrawals from these accounts differ in the amount of money available for annual spending during retirement. The common practice for the scheduling of withdrawals from retirement savings accounts is to first deplete the after-tax account, then the tax-deferred and finally the Roth IRA. This paper quantitatively evaluates optimal plans that maximize spending by sequencing annual withdrawals to minimize the impact of taxes in order to achieve a targeted final total asset value. We show that the optimal retirement savings withdrawal strategy improves on common practice by increasing the money available for retirement spending by 3% to 30%. Most of the optimal withdrawal plans evaluated in this paper make withdrawals from the tax-deferred account across the entire span of retirement in parallel with withdrawals from first the after-tax account and then the Roth IRA later in retirement.","Welch, James S, Jr", Feature,,2015,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Withdrawals , Roth IRAs , Personal income , Savings , Income taxes , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"Race, Trust, and Retirement Decisions","Using the 2008 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this study investigates whether racial differences in trust can explain the decision to consult a financial planner and the variation in accumulated retirement wealth. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to report having low trust compared to non-black, non-Hispanic respondents. The results provide evidence that low trust has a greater impact among blacks than non-black, non-Hispanic respondents. Low trust has a weaker impact among Hispanics on the decision to consult a financial planner and on the accumulation of retirement wealth. There is no evidence that hiring a financial planner has a larger impact on retirement wealth among blacks or Hispanics than it does among non-black, non-Hispanic households.","Martin, Terrance K, Jr, PhD;Finke, Michael, PhD;Gibson, Philip, PhD", Feature,,2014,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Racial differences , Trust , Children & youth , Retirement planning , Hispanic people , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

A Better Systematic Withdrawal Strategy-The Actuarial Approach,"Retirees generally have at least two potentially conflicting financial goals: (i) spend enough each year to maintain a certain standard of living throughout retirement and (ii) not spend so much that accumulated savings run out prior to death. Corollaries to these two primary goals include: (i) having relatively predictable and stable inflation-adjusted spendable income from year to year (ii) having spending flexibility to meet unforeseen expenses, (iii) maximizing the general level of spendable income and (iv) not leaving too much unspent at death. An optimal retirement spending strategy should address each of these goals to some degree, depending on the preferences of the individual retiree.","Steiner, Ken", Feature,,2014,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Withdrawals , Personal finance , Retirement planning , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic
Parental and Early Influences on Expectations of Financial Planning for Retirement,"This investigation was designed to test a theoretically-grounded model of the psychomotivational dimensions that underlie retirement planning. In developing the hypothesized model, special consideration was given to positive early influences on development that could potentially impact other dimensions known to predict successful planning practices. Participants were 722 college students who reported the extent of childhood personal finance lessons learned, their retirement goal clarity and knowledge of financial planning, and expectations of future planning and anticipated satisfaction with life in retirement. As hypothesized, two measures of early financial influences were predictive of other variables known to underlie the retirement planning decision-making process, and one's vision of satisfaction in retirement. Results and implications are discussed in terms of the way in which motivational forces, particularly those that occur early in life, contribute to perceptions of future planning efforts.","Koposko, Janet L, MS;Hershey, Douglas A, PhD", Feature,,2014,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Parents & parenting , Motivation , Personal finance , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Role of Trans-Generational Financial Knowledge and Self-Reported Financial Literacy on Borrowing Practices and Debt Accumulation of College Students,"This paper studies the effects of trans-generational financial knowledge, self-reported financial knowledge, academic performance, and overall financial literacy on financial management practices, using a sample of 380 college students. Exploratory estimates using a series of ordered Probit models indicate that academic status and self-reported overconfidence on financial knowledge relate positively to the amount of debt a student carries. More interesting, our estimates provide robust support to the hypothesis that a trans-generational financial knowledge effect from parents to students plays a major role in reducing the amount of financial burden students assume, both in the form of student loans and credit card balance. In addition, students that maintain a good credit card history, as reflected by high repayment rates, are more likely to hold lower debt amounts than otherwise. A high debt level implies that students are living beyond their means and consequently developing unhealthy financial management practices. Our paper provides evidence in favor to the hypothesis that early financial education is a means to reduce or maintain low levels of indebtedness. Our empirical estimates also point out to the presence of a strong overconfidence effect, as reflected by unrealistically high self-reported financial knowledge, leading students to an incorrect decision making process in favor to holding more debt. We argue that lack of personal financial literacy is at the core of high debt accumulation.","Smith, Chad;Barboza, Gustavo", Feature,,2014,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , College students , Financial planning , Financial literacy , Borrowing , Financial management , Personal finance , Hypotheses , Knowledge , Self report",ProQuest One Academic
Loss Aversion under Cognitive Load,"An experiment was conducted to explore whether loss aversion is altered when individuals are placed under a higher level of cognitive load. The coefficients of monetary loss aversion were measured for 30 participants under low and high cognitive load. Memorizations of differing spans of digits were used to manipulate cognitive load. Participants' skin conductance was measured to quantify emotional responses to gains and losses. No statistically significant evidence was found that loss aversion, as measured by choice, is altered when individuals are placed under a higher level of cognitive load. Statistically significant evidence was found that a higher level of cognitive load temporarily reduces an individual's emotional arousal to absolute and relative small dollar losses.","Guillemette, Michael A, PhD, CFP®;James, Russell N, III, PhD, JD, CFP®;Larsen, Jeff, PhD", Feature,,2014,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Cognition & reasoning , Financial planning , Losses , Cognitive load",ProQuest One Academic
Portfolio Size Matters,"In contrast to target date funds that vary asset allocation by age alone, it is important to take into account both the client's age and the client's portfolio size relative to spending goals when determining an optimal asset allocation. Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) is a mathematical optimization technique that can be used to determine optimal dynamic adjustments to asset allocation in response to evolving portfolio wealth and time horizons. Using SDP, portfolio size appears at least as important to asset allocation decisions as age. For a 25 year old, asset allocation using SDP requires approximately 20-34% less resources than traditional target date asset allocation approaches. Financial planners can provide much value to their clients by incorporating portfolio size into a dynamic asset allocation strategy.","Irlam, Gordon", Feature,,2014,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Dynamic programming , Lifecycle funds , Size , Asset allocation , Optimization techniques , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

HOW PRIOR OUTCOMES AFFECT INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS' SUBSEQUENT RISK TAKING,"We present empirical evidence of how prior outcomes affect individual investors' subsequent risk taking. Investors who experience big gains or big losses are likely to exit the stock market; however, investors remaining in the market increase their portfolio risk taking following losses. They replace stocks sold with new positions of higher (lower) value following recent losses (gains), thereby leading to increased (decreased) stock portfolio risk taking. Our results are consistent with predictions of consumption habit formation interacting with the disposition effect. Our results cannot be explained by information, simple rebalancing, the house money effect, or the break even effect.

DOES VISUALLY DISPLAYING PROBABILITY OUTCOMES CHANGE STOCK SELECTION?,"Prospect theory assumes individuals are more risk averse with gains than to equivalent losses and indicates how an investment question is framed influences individual decision making. However, limited research has been conducted on the influence of visually displaying the probability of different outcomes, versus in written form, on investment decision making. Hypothetical investment scenarios tested the effect of visually displaying probability information. Results suggest that the visual display of probability shifts investment preferences to the stock with the greatest probability of a gain. Thus, it appears investors are willing to take more financial risks when probability information is displayed visually. Financial planners could incorporate visual displays when communicating with clients to help match the clients' risk capacity with risk tolerance.

CONSIDERATION OF RETIREMENT INCOME STAGES IN PLANNING FOR RETIREMENT,"Previous retirement adequacy studies have ignored expected retirement income stages. Ignoring retirement income stages results in biased estimations of retirement adequacy. This study analyzes retirement income stage theoretically and then empirically. Based on the 1995 to 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) datasets, about 73% of working households with the head and/or spouse/partner age 35-70 and working full-time will have more than one retirement income stage. When income stages are taken into account, the proportion of households with retirement adequacy ranges from 44% in 1995 to 58% in 2007. Ignoring retirement income stages results in adequacy proportions being 23 to 28 percentage points higher. Financial planners and researchers evaluating retirement adequacy should take retirement income stages into account.

DIRECT INVESTING IN BONDS DURING RETIREMENT,"Direct bond purchases can address major issues confronting retirees better than alternative investments such as providing retirement income, moving to a retirement homes, leaving a legacy, etc. It is best to concentrate on cash flows and conceptualize ""risk"" as failing to meet unavoidable payments, rather than on returns and return volatility as a proxy for risk.

HOW MUCH IS YOUR 401(K) WORTH?,"How much is your 401(k) or IRA worth? Like many questions, the answer is it depends. In this paper we discuss three different methods that can be used to estimate the relative value of a tax-advantaged account within a financial planning context (or the ""effective"" value): the Balance approach, the Tax-Adjusted approach, and Benefit Equivalent approach. The Balance approach is based simply on the value of the account and the Tax-Adjusted approach adjusts this value to take taxes into account. The Benefit Equivalent approach determines the value of the 401(k) or IRA relative to the amount of income it can generate over the lifetime of the account when compared to a taxable account. This is the most complex approach, but potentially the most viable within a financial planning context. While each of the three different approaches provides a different insight into the effective value of a 401(k) or IRA, the Benefit Equivalent approach may be the most relevant for investors who are using these tax-advantaged accounts for their intended purpose: to create income during retirement. Through simulations, we found that for a 401(k) the Benefit Equivalent effective value of a stock portfolio may be worth approximately 100% of a taxable account and approximately 110% of a taxable account for bonds. For a Roth IRA we found that the Benefit Equivalent effective value of a stock portfolio may be worth approximately 130% of a taxable account and approximately 140% of a taxable account for bonds.

FINANCIAL PLANNING IMPLICATIONS OF THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT OF 2012,"Income and estate tax planning has been remarkably difficult for the past decade, inhibited by an ongoing series of temporary rules and important tax planning provisions that are perpetually scheduled to lapse or about to sunset.

Personality Traits and Life Insurance Ownership Among Older Americans,"Background At the end of 2020, American households owned $20.4 trillion of life insurance coverage (ACLI, 2020). While approximately 52 percent of Americans own some form of life insurance, 48 percent do not, and 102 million households feel that they are uninsured or underinsured (LIMRA, 2021). Furthermore, 42 percent of American households acknowledge that if the primary wage earner died unexpectedly, they would feel the impact within six months, while 25 percent would feel the impact within one month (LIMRA, 2021). There’s a bevy of empirical research investigating the potential factors that could affect the demand for life insurance. A comprehensive review of the determinants of the demand for life insurance finds many conflicting associations across the lifecycle, both financial and social (Liebenberg et. Al, 2012). Studies show that age, marital status, number of children, education, spousal employment status, family income, and net worth characteristics are determinants of the demand for life insurance (Hau, 2000; Zietz, 2003). Previous literature finds that behavioral barriers, such as mental accounting, are potential barriers to the life insurance purchase decision (Coe &amp; Belbase, 2016). The current study contributes to the existing literature by investigating personality trait associations with life insurance ownership (LIO). The results could help reduce the gap between the theoretical need and consumer demand for life insurance by providing information that aids financial planners in reframing recommendations to fit client personality traits. Purpose This study investigates the determinants of consumer demand for life insurance. The literature suggests a behavior gap exists between the economic need for life insurance and the low propensity of consumer demand for insurance products. Researchers have examined potential factors for this life insurance demand “puzzle” with possible explanatory factors such as individual preferences, literacy level, and financial constraints. Although many factors have been studied, the life insurance demand “puzzle” persists. This study contributes to the literature by investigating the association between personality traits and life insurance ownership as a possible explanation for life insurance consumer demand. Financial planners and life insurance professionals could benefit from understanding their client’s personality traits to tailor recommendations in a way that could increase the efficiency of the client's information processing and thus potentially influence a favorable life insurance purchase decision.","Cherry, Preston D, PhD, CFP®;Asebedo, Sarah, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,,2022,Journal of Personal Finance," Older people , Personality traits , Life insurance",ProQuest One Academic
Determinants of Advisory Fee in U.S. Equity Mutual Funds,"This study investigates the factors that influence the advisory fee and determines whether mutual funds' ADVISOR fees benefit from economies of scale. After adjusting for fund characteristics, empirical data demonstrate that growth in the advisory fee have been less than proportional to increases in assets in the US equities mutual fund sector, indicating industry-wide economies of scale in the advisory fee. In addition, older funds, index funds, deferred load funds, Class A funds, Class C funds, and institutional funds charge a lower advisory fee. On the other hand, mutual funds with a front-end load, a 12b-1 plan, and a higher turnover ratio charge a higher advisory fee. A mutual fund's advisory fee is also determined by the fund's investing goal. Advisory fees are also lower in funds with a larger administrative charge. The study did not find any evidence of the mutual fund cash flows and advisory fee.","Kanuri, Srinidhi;Malhotra, D K", Journal Article,,2022,Journal of Personal Finance," Fees & charges , Stocks , Mutual funds",ProQuest One Academic

2022 National Financial Plan Competition Winner: Case Narrative - The Franklin Family,"Chamberlain and Mathis offer a case narrative involving the Franklin Family in York PA. The business is comprised of three distinct parts, all under the one Sub S structure -- Franklin Distributors. First, they have the commercial contracts with both hotels and restaurants to deliver beverages of all kinds (excluding wines). Their gross revenues are $4.2 M. They have 27 employees, in addition to the two partners. They have one key man Kyle, who is their COO making $95,000 salary. The operations net each partner $175K salary plus a $50K bonus. Their EBIDA is $600K and the estimated multiple for valuation purposes in this industry is 6 times EBIDA. They have a Safe Harbor 401k plan. Next, they have the trucking portion that has 17 trucks making daily deliveries to customers. Lastly, they have the warehouse (worth $1.3M), where the company stores the inventory and houses its offices. The building, worth $1.3M, is fully depreciated and has no mortgage. The potential purchase is a competitor who is half the size of Franklin, but the economies of scale make this a synergistic purchase. The seller also has a warehouse that is a valuable asset and aligns with Franklin's growth plan.","Chamberlain, Sarah;Mathis, Andrew", Commentary,,2022,Journal of Personal Finance," Deliveries , Mortgages , Valuation , Inventory management , Contracts",ProQuest One Academic
Identifying Consumer Financial Opinion Leaders,"This study explores consumer financial opinion leaders (Financial OLs)-consumers who lead others in personal financial decisions. We focus on identifying the demographic attributes of Financial OLs, their social connectivity, and their engagement with innovative consumer financial products and services. A survey of 486 U.S. respondents indicates that though Financial OLs are observed across all demographic groups, a greater percentage of Financial OLs is found among low-income and low-education groups. Further, unlike other domains, results suggest that Financial OLs are not particularly socially connected and are not necessarily knowledgeable about the products and services in which they offer advice.

Racial/Ethnic Differences in Life Insurance Ownership &amp; Life Insurance Adequacy,"This research aimed to measure racial/ethnic differences in life insurance ownership and life insurance underinsurance among Black, Hispanic, White, and Asian/other consumers. Using the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, probit regression analyses were utilized to determine whether there is an association between race/ethnicity and owning life insurance and whether there is an association between race/ethnicity and life insurance adequacy in relation to the respondents' human life value. Results show that Black households had a higher probability of owning life insurance and Hispanic and Asian/other households had a lower probability of owning life insurance when compared to White households. Hispanic households had a higher probability of being underinsured compared to White households. Use of a financial planner was associated negatively with underinsurance.

No Good Deed Goes Unpunished: The Hidden Complications of Donation-Based Crowdfunding,"On March 23, 2021, a GoFundMe was launched by a friend of Officer Eric Talley, an 11-year veteran of the Boulder, Colorado Police Department. Officer Talley was killed the day before while bravely responding to a mass shooting at a local grocery store. The public responded with enormous outreach and support; in less than 10 days, the campaign raised over $1 million from more than 11,500 individuals. GoFundMe has generated over 120 million donations, helping individuals raise more than $9 billion since its debut in May 2008 (""A Year in Giving: 2019,"" n.d.). The site supports incentive-based crowdfunding activities, but also receives donations for personal causes like unexpected medical bills, tuition assistance, and help during tragedies. While crowdfunding growth has been explosive there may be severe tax and income-based eligibility complications, which are often disregarded until it is too late. The IRS has been slow and opaque to adopt rules that clarify how campaign donations are treated for both federal income tax and gift purposes. This lack of clarity has created significant and unexpected tax liabilities. Crowdfunding efforts have also been anecdotally documented to undermine one's eligibility for common income-based assistance such as Medicare, Medicaid, Section 20 Housing, SSDI, and SNAP in some circumstances. These effects are multipronged in that they might have implications for parents, children, other household members, or even friends who receive assistance outside of the campaign's originator or designated beneficiary. We disentangle a crowdfunding campaign's far-reaching and often overlooked consequences, to provide insights for creating a well-designed campaign, including the end transfer of funds from the designated beneficiary to the end-recipient. Our discussion addresses nuances related to (a) federal income taxes, (b) gift taxes, and (c) income-based assistance programs, for campaign participants, family members, and friends.","McClatchey, Christine A;Martin, Michael", Journal Article,,2022,Journal of Personal Finance," Fund raising , Crowdfunding , Tax legislation , Donations , Income taxes , Mass murders",ProQuest One Academic

An Evaluation of the Consistency of Financial Risk-Aversion Estimates,"This paper reports results from tests designed to determine whether financial risk aversion-the opposite of which is financial risk tolerance-varies based on the at-risk dollar amount presented in a risk-aversion evaluation. Risk aversion was observed to decrease slightly when respondents were presented with a low at-risk dollar amount, although the difference in observed scores across three at-risk dollar scenarios was less than one point on a 10-point scale. It was also noted that survey respondents were relatively risk averse and that females and older respondents exhibited greater risk aversion. When presented with a high at-risk dollar choice, those who self-identified as Black and those with high incomes exhibited less financial risk aversion.","Grable, John E, PhD CFP®;Kwak, Eun-Jin, MA", Journal Article,,2022,Journal of Personal Finance," Risk factors , Risk aversion , Financial management",ProQuest One Academic
Financial Knowledge and the Relationship with Using Professional Investment Advice and Granting Trading Discretion,"Using the 2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) Investor Survey, this research investigated the relationships between financial knowledge and the decision to use investment advice and to grant trading discretion. Among a sample of 1,203 respondents, objective financial knowledge was negatively related to making investment decisions based on recommendations from a financial professional, although no relationship was found with subjective knowledge. Among a restricted sample of 710 respondents who use financial advice from a professional, subjective knowledge was negatively related to granting trading discretion to a financial professional while no relationship was found with objective knowledge. Overconfidence was positively related to relying on recommendations to make investment decisions but negatively related to granting trading discretion. Financial professionals can use these findings to better understand the implications financial knowledge has on client engagements and adjust their communication practices and service offerings accordingly.","Sommer, Matthew, PhD CFP® CFA;Lim, Hanna, PhD CFP®", Journal Article,,2022,Journal of Personal Finance," Knowledge , Investment , Investment advisors , Financial planning",ProQuest One Academic

Having a financial advisor is also positively associated with current and subsequent investment returns, largely due to greater allocations to equities.","Cummings, Benjamin F, PhD CFP®;James, Russell N, III JD PhD CFP®", Journal Article,,2022,Journal of Personal Finance," Impact analysis , Older people , Financial planning , Wealth , Investment advisors , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

"The Role of Financial Literacy, Need for Cognition and Political Orientation on Consumers' Use of Social Media in Financial Decision Making","American consumers' reliance on social media has exploded in recent years. Despite this growth, and the fact that the social media penetration in the US exceeds that of most other countries, little is known about the extent by which social media use affects consumers' financial decisions and their personal finances. In this study, the role of financial literacy, need for cognition, and political orientation on consumer reliance on social media for financial decision making is examined. Using a national panel of US consumers, the effects of these three variables as well as the role of consumer demographics are explored. Further analysis reveals the existence of three underlying consumer segments, with distinct characteristics and social media usage behaviors. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings on public policy initiatives, consumer protection, and financial literacy programs.","Estelami, Hooman, PhD;Florendo, Jenna", Journal Article,,2021,Journal of Personal Finance," Decision making , Cognition & reasoning , Financial literacy , Personal finance , Social networks , Public policy , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Where Knowledge Meets Perceptions: Emerging Adults and Their Perceptions of Financial Knowledge,"Subjective and objective financial knowledge both play a role in individuals' financial capabilities. This study examines the relationship between subjective and objective financial knowledge and whether an individual's perceptions of their financial knowledge change over time. Prior research suggests overconfidence may be a result of a discrepancy between objective and subjective financial knowledge. The results of this study suggest that overconfidence may be more related to changes in perceptions of financial knowledge. This particular study looks at college students, both during and shortly after college. Individuals' perceptions of their financial knowledge appear to drop after college as they enter the workforce. This may suggest a window of opportunity for financial counselors and advisors to help individuals as they begin their careers.","Tenney, Jacob, PhD CFP®;Kalenkoski, Charlene M, PhD CFP®;Serido, Joyce, PhD;Shim, Soyeon, PhD", Journal Article,,2021,Journal of Personal Finance," Knowledge , Perceptions , Financial literacy , College students , College graduates",ProQuest One Academic

Is Retirement That Easy? Analyzing the Impact of Financial Rules of Thumb Through the Theory of Planned Behavior,"This study investigates the relationship between sociological characteristics and retiring on time within a sample of 2,129 US individuals over age 50 from the Health and Retirement Study. Sociological factors were operationalized through the theory of planned behavior constructs of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) within a structural equation modeling framework revealed that intention to retire and perceived behavioral control are positively associated with early or on-time retirement. Attitudes and subjective norms, measured by financial rules of thumb, were not related to retirement intent. This study adds to the body of knowledge with a positive association of attitudes and perceived behavioral control on early or on-time retirement while financial rules of thumb alone do not ensure financial success.","Russell, Matthew, MBA;Strong, C Ramel, CFP®, CIPM;Krausman, Jodi, CPA PMP;Lawson, Derek, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,,2021,Journal of Personal Finance," Sociology , Attitudes , Norms , Retirement planning , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic
Student Loan Debt and Financial Well-Being of the Borrower: Does It Matter Whom the Debt Is For?,"Using data from the 2017 U.S. Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), this study classifies student debt into three categories by beneficiary (self, spouse, and children) and examines the relationship between each category and financial well-being. The results show that the association of student debt with the financial well-being of borrowers is negative and significant, regardless of whether the loan is used to finance the education of the borrower, spouse, or children. The paper further finds evidence that the marginal effect of student debt on the financial well-being of the borrower is substantial when the debt is used to finance the education of children rather than the education of the borrower or the borrower's spouse.

Simple Decision-Making Rules of Thumb and Financial Well-Being,"The purpose of this research is to understand what financial rules of thumb individuals use, how often these rules are used, and the statistical relationship between the use of different rules of thumb and financial well-being. We ran a survey using a nationally representative sample of Americans over the age of 18 (N = 867) to identify rules that people report using when making financial decisions. We also measured participants' financial well-being using the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) financial well-being scale. We found some rules are much more commonly reported than others, and further we identified a set of commonly used rules that had positive correlations with financial well-being. Findings also suggest that well-being is additionally related to the frequency and automaticity of rule use, suggesting the importance of simplicity and habit in rules being effective.","Lamas, Samantha;Murphy, Ryan O, PhD", Journal Article,,2021,Journal of Personal Finance," Decision making , Rules , Financial literacy , Personal finance",ProQuest One Academic

Determinants of Parents' College Education Saving Decisions,"This study examines the factors associated with the decisions of U.S. households to save for the college education of their children using state-level data from the 2015 U.S. National Financial Capability Study. The results suggest that financially fragile households and those characterized by low income, low education, more children, no health insurance, and no homeownership are less likely to have college savings. Households who are willing to take financial risks and those with higher perceived financial knowledge are more likely to save for the college education of their children. Whereas bond- and loan-pricing literacy are the only components of financial literacy that are associated with a higher probability of college savings, the overall financial literacy score is associated with a lower likelihood of saving for college.","Korankye, Thomas, PhD, CFP;Kalenkoski, Charlene M, PhD, CFP", Journal Article,,2021,Journal of Personal Finance," Higher education , Households , Financial planning , Financial literacy , Savings , Student financial aid , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Mortality Salience Lowers Preferred Retirement Asset Decumulation Rates,"Standard life-cycle economic theory suggests that people should spend down assets during retirement at a rate maximizing their lifetime consumption. However, actual retiree behavior exhibits asset decumulation at much slower rates, not at all, or even continued accumulation. One potential factor is that decumulation requires personal mortality estimations. Previous research finds that personal mortality reminders (1) are aversive and (2) increase focus on impacting those who will survive. Correspondingly, recent research has found that (1) annuity purchases are reduced due to associated personal mortality reminders and (2) mortality reminders increase relative preference for annuities that pay less income but provide a greater bequest provision. This study investigates whether mortality salience will also influence the broader issue of an individual's asset decumulation decisions in retirement. Using a randomly assigned experimental test, we find that increasing mortality salience increases the desire to retain assets in retirement, reducing the preferred spending rates in retirement. Understanding the role of mortality salience on decisions about asset decumulation in retirement can be beneficial to academic researchers and financial planners.","Liu, Yi, PhD;James, Russell, JD, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,,2021,Journal of Personal Finance," Financial planning , Assets , Annuities , Retirement planning , Mortality , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

Additionally, this study also finds that using financial planners reduces the likelihood of holding the losers too long in the down market which might hurt individual investors' abilities to achieve long-term financial goals. Personal characteristics, such as gender, age, race, personal saving rate, and investable assets may present an essential part in shaping individuals' investment decisions in a recession.

The Relationship Between Home Equity and Retirement Satisfaction,"As life expectancies continue to climb, home equity may increasingly become a much-needed resource to finance late-life consumption. This study hypothesizes that a higher ratio of home equity relative to net worth creates resource constraints, resulting in disutility for individuals who are in retirement. The findings suggest that increases in a retiree's ratio of home equity relative to net worth is associated negatively with a satisfactory retirement experience. The ensuing discussion highlights two important issues. The first issue is that, for many retirees, home equity is inefficient in promoting retiree well-being. The second issue is that retirees may have limited knowledge of the available tools to access home equity. Thus, arguments for increased efforts to promote the responsible utilization of home equity as a part of an individual's plan for retirement are discussed.","Pearson, Blain, PhD, CFP;Lacombe, Donald, PhD", Journal Article,,2021,Journal of Personal Finance," Financial planning , Home equity loans , Equity , Retirement income , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

Student Loan Debt Letters: How Colleges Communicate Debt with Students,"As the student loan debt crisis has continued to gain national attention from higher education leaders, education policymakers, and the media, states have begun mandating that institutions send student loan debt letters to any current or former student with outstanding student loan debt. Preliminary studies of the effectiveness of student loan debt letters have been mixed, but these studies have not analyzed how institutions have composed student loan debt letters at the word-, sentence-, and document-level. As a result, this study gathered six student loan debt letters sent by different institutions across the United States and analyzed these letters for readability, cohesion, and lexical diversity. Results suggest student loan debt letters have been written in drastically different ways and do not share common vocabulary, possibly confusing the debt repayment process for students.

Antecedents of Financial Practices among Latina/o University Students,"Earlier studies have often identified the Latina/o population as having financial disadvantages over non-Latina/o populations. To identify controllable factors associated with better financial practices among Latina/o individuals and families, this study explored demographic and family qualities related to financial practices (budgeting, tracking spending, setting immediate or intermediate financial goals, and saving a portion of earnings). The data came from a self-report survey completed by 607 Latina/o university students. After controlling for demographics, hierarchical multiple regression models showed parental financial socialization, financial socialization from other family members, living with parents, and students' years of education were positively related to some financial practices. Parents' education and family wealth were not significantly related to any of the financial practices. Immigration generation status was not related to any financial practices once family qualities were included. The findings support the potential to empower Latino families to engage in better financial practices through factors they can control.","Plunkett, Scott W, PhD;Mimura, Yoko, PhD;Koonce, Joan, PhD AFC CPFFE;Hsu, Wen Chin, PhD", Journal Article,,2020,Journal of Personal Finance," Socialization , Demographics , Budgeting , Financial management , Families & family life , University students",ProQuest One Academic

Determining A Portfolio's Range of Probable Wealth - Without Monte Carlo Simulations,"Saving for retirement, saving for a child's education, or outliving your nest egg during retirement all depend on the wonders of compounding. For typical investment applications the annual compounding rate is not fixed and not certain. For the past several decades Monte Carlo simulations have been used to address this uncertainty. A Monte Carlo simulation combines multiple trials of a portfolio's potential performance. For a given time period and time horizon a Monte Carlo trial will calculate the final worth of a portfolio based on compounding random returns consistent with each time period's probability distribution. Upwards of 1,000 trails are conducted forming the probability distribution of the portfolio's worth at the end of the time horizon. These simulations typically assume a normal distribution for the portfolio's annual probability of return and can account for annual contributions or withdrawals. In this paper a closed form solution is derived for a portfolio's probability of future wealth in the presence of annual contributions or withdrawals and normally distributed annual returns. While closed form solutions are mathematically preferable to approximations, in this case other practical considerations arise. Few practitioners (or their clients) have easy access to Monte Carlo simulations. Those available on the internet lack the input flexibility, ease of use, or speed of the closed form solution developed in this paper. This closed form solution has been implemented in excel making use of excel's probability functionality. This implementation accepts user inputs for the mean and standard deviation of equity and fixed income returns and their correlation, the time horizon over which the probability of wealth will evolve, annual contributions or withdrawals, and the funding allocation between equities and fixed income. The output of the model is the cumulative distribution function of net wealth along with values highlighted at the 25%, 50%, and 75% confidence levels. Results are compared to the author's Monte Carlo simulations, the Monte Carlo simulations reported by Pfau (2016), the Monte Carlo simulations executed in Portfolio Visualizer (2019), and historical S&amp;P 500 returns. Excel programing for a particular scenario is displayed in the appendix.","Hogan, John M, PhD", Journal Article,,2020,Journal of Personal Finance," Financial planning , Monte Carlo simulation , Investment advisors , Wealth , Probability distribution , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

Using data collected from 1,005 U.S. households, we found no evidence that working with an advisor was related to anxiety; however, a positive relationship was found with confidence. Further, couples that make decisions jointly were found to have significantly more investment confidence than couples where one partner makes decisions alone. These findings highlight an additional benefit advisors provide to their clients, and a compelling reason for couples to consider making financial decisions jointly.","Sommer, Matthew, CFA, CFP;Lim, HanNa, PhD, CFP;MacDonald, Maurice, PhD", Journal Article,,2020,Journal of Personal Finance," Investors , Investment , Financial management , Advisors , Couples , Retirement , Anxiety , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Finding the Next Major Donor: The Relationship between Financial Planning Horizon and Charitable Giving,"Previous research has studied the characteristics associated with the presence and amount of charitable giving. However, few of these studies have explored the relationship between financial planning horizon and philanthropic donations, especially large donations. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the Health and Retirement Study data, this paper explores the factors associated with charitable giving over time with a particular focus on financial planning horizon. This paper concludes that American adults who have longer financial planning horizons are more likely to make charitable donations compared to those whose planning horizon is short, i.e., less than six months. Among donors, major gifts are associated with long-term financial planning horizon, wealth, religious activity frequency, volunteer experience, and education.","Liu, Zhikun, PhD, CFP;James, Russell, III, PhD, JD, CFP;Aboohamidi, Abbas, PhD", Journal Article,,2020,Journal of Personal Finance," Financial planning , Charities , Decision making , Donations",ProQuest One Academic

We test whether longevity income framed as ""insurance"" is more attractive than longevity income framed as an ""annuity,"" since longevity income is consumption protection. In a sample of 1,425 respondents, we find that respondents are less likely to state a demand for at least one longevity annuity when a longevity insurance frame is shown before a longevity annuity frame. People with higher numeracy are less likely to succumb to longevity income framing effects. In addition, the likelihood of stating a demand for at least one longevity annuity increases as stock market loss aversion rises.","Guillemette, Michael, PhD, CFP®;Jurgenson, Jesse B, PhD, AFC®;Sharpe, Deanna L, PhD, CFP®, CRPS®, CRPC®;Zhang, Xianwu, PhD", Journal Article,,2020,Journal of Personal Finance," Income , Annuities",ProQuest One Academic
The Impact of Financial Software Use on Financial Literacy Education - Evidence from China,"Consumers are challenged by an increasingly complex financial world that employs a wide range of financial products and services. Most consumers lack the foundational financial literacy and financial capability necessary to navigate this increasingly complicated environment. Consumers also have trouble with the burden of managing their own retirement savings. Consumers who have endowed and attained human capital may view financial education programs as ineffective due to inequality of education standards. Financial software serves as an appealing accompaniment to an individual's human capital by offering visualized tools and information that allow consumers to monitor, compare, and track their own financial progress. We investigate the impact of financial software use on the efficacy of financial literacy education. Using data from the Survey of Chinese College Students' Financial Capability and Behavior (SCCSFCB) 2016-2017, we find that using financial software has a significant relationship with financial knowledge improvement after the treatment of financial literacy education. Implications of this study may provide contributions to policy makers, financial planning practitioners, and financial literacy educators.","Bi, Qianwen, MBA, PhD;Dean, Luke, PhD, CRC, RFC;Meng, Xiangyi, PhD", Journal Article,,2020,Journal of Personal Finance," Financial planning , Software , Technology , Human capital , Financial literacy , Personal finance , Education",ProQuest One Academic
The Relationship Between Financial Advisor Designations and Misconduct,"Using a unique misconduct scoring method, we explored the relationship between professional designations and public record misconduct for securities-licensed financial advisors regulated by FINRA in the state of Florida. We intend to validate the signals sent by designations' sponsors that their higher education and ethical conduct mandates are associated with better consumer outcomes, as measured by: (a) lessened complaints; (b) regulatory actions; and (c) other documented misconduct. After controlling for confounding factors of gender, life insurance sales licensure, and fiduciary/non-fiduciary dual registration, we find that the least severe measure of advisor misconduct is negatively associated with possessing any of the CFA®, ChFC®, and CFP® certifications. However, being a CFA® charterhold and having the CFP® certification lose statistical significance at the 5% level for two more egregious measures of advisor misconduct. These findings provided limited evidence regarding the negative relation between these certifications and advisor misconduct, with the strongest evidence for the ChFC® certification.","Camarda, Jeffrey, PhD, EA, CFA;de Jong, Pieter J, PhD;Timmerman, Inga, PhD, CFP", Journal Article,,2020,Journal of Personal Finance," Retirement planning , Investment advisors , Advisors , Financial planners , Professional misconduct , Florida , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Changes in Household Net Financial Assets After the Great Recession: Did Financial Planners Make a Difference?,"This study utilized the 2007-2009 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) Panel Data Set to examine the impact of financial planner use on household net financial asset level during the Great Recession. Data included 3,862 respondents who completed the SCF survey and a follow-up panel interview. The results indicated that starting to use a financial planner during the Great Recession had a positive impact on preserving and increasing the value of households' net financial assets, while curtailing the use of a financial planner during this time had a negative impact on preserving the value of households' net financial assets. Thus, study findings indicated that the benefit of using a financial planner may be particularly helpful during a major a financial downturn.","Goetz, Joseph W, PhD;Palmer, Lance, PhD;Zhang, Lini, PhD;Chatterjee, Swarn, PhD", Journal Article,,2020,Journal of Personal Finance," Financial planning , Investment advisors , Great Recession , Assets , Wealth management , Households , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic
Financial Risk Tolerance Among White and Hispanic Households,"This study uses data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances to explore the financial risk tolerance of households headed by Hispanic and non-Hispanic White individuals. The results of the logistic regression highlight that the factors related to financial risk tolerance differ for White and Hispanic respondents. Education and income were important in explaining the financial risk tolerance of both groups. Additionally, net worth was important in explaining the financial risk tolerance of White, but not Hispanic, households. The results show that the models used to explain financial risk tolerance may not be a good fit with the financial risk tolerance of Hispanic households.","Fisher, Patti J, PhD", Journal Article,,2020,Journal of Personal Finance," Households , Consumer credit , Personal finance , Risk exposure , White people , Hispanic people",ProQuest One Academic

From Financial Education to Financial Literacy to Financial Stability: Evidence of National and Regional Connections,"The present study uses data from the National Financial Capability Study to analyze the degree of impact of financial education on financial literacy based on the related socialization factors. We then analyze the degree to which financial literacy explains financial stability. We find higher levels of financial literacy in those who have been exposed to financial education and that those with higher levels of financial literacy are more financially stable. Further, we find that a lack of exposure to financial education has a negative impact on financial literacy that is more severe than the positive impact of financial education. Lastly, we find that financial education socialization varies by race, gender, and socio-economic status. These findings provide a roadmap for financial educators and practitioners to account for limited exposure to financial education and financial overconfidence in order to have the greatest impact.","Yates, Stephanie R, PhD, CFP®, AFC®", Journal Article,,2019,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Socialization , Socioeconomic factors , Financial literacy",ProQuest One Academic

Financial Education and Demand for Debt Counseling Advice,"The purpose of this study is to examine potential effects of consumer financial education on demand for debt counseling advice using a large and representative national dataset. Previous research has examined demographic, economic, and financial capability factors on the demand for debt counseling advice. After controlling for these factors and eliminating the effect of bankruptcy, financial education, a variable not examined in previous research, is positively associated with the demand for debt counseling advice. Education attainment is similarly associated with debt counseling. These results suggest evidence of the complementary nature of financial education. Our results indicate that consumers who have been exposed to financial education are more likely to seek debt counseling advice.","Porto, Nilton, MBA, PhD;Xiao, Jing Jian, PhD", Journal Article,,2019,Journal of Personal Finance," Counseling , Impact analysis , Education , Financial literacy , Consumers , Demand , Debt",ProQuest One Academic

"The Impact of Family Economic Strain On Work-Family Conflict, Marital Support, Marital Quality, and Marital Stability During the Middle Years","Over the past few decades, US families have been faced with several economic recessions. The regularity and severity of these economic crises lends to the importance of having an understanding of how these events affect families. The present study investigates the effects of family economic strain on marital quality and marital stability through individual and dyadic models, incorporating work-family conflict and marital support as mediators. The study analyzed secondary data from the Iowa Youth and Families Project (IYFP) and Midlife Transition Project (MTP) collected from 370 middle-aged married couples across a 12-year time period that encompassed the US early 1990s recession and the recession of 2001, which occurred between the years 1989 and 2001. The results support the hypotheses that the impact of economic strain upon marital quality and marital stability is mitigated through a positive perception of work-family conflict and marital support. Implications for future research and for financial practice are discussed.","Ross, D Bruce, PhD;Gale, Jerry, PhD;Wickrama, Kandauda K A S, PhD;Goetz, Joseph, PhD;Vowels, Matthew, MS", Journal Article,,2019,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Impact analysis , Financial counseling , Marital stability , Economic impact , Financial management , Work life balance , Personal finance , Recessions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

An Exploration of Overconfidence in the Utilization of Financial Advisors,"Households are not seeking the assistance of financial advisors in planning for retirement. This study explores why individuals are not utilizing a financial advisor. A survey was conducted on individuals who completed the 2012 National Financial Capability Study, which was organized by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The results revealed that overconfidence is statistically significant in explaining the likelihood of an individual utilizing a financial advisor. The results also revealed that men utilize financial advisors more frequently than women. Furthermore, the results indicated that an individual might utilize a financial advisor once their overconfidence decreases. Moreover, as education increases, so too does the likelihood that an individual will utilize a financial advisor. However, there is a need for additional research on overconfidence and the utilization of financial advisors in the current economy, as well as researching the relationship between overconfidence and other variables such as employment and health status of an individual.","Lewis, Marc B, DBA", Journal Article,,2019,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Financial literacy , Employment , Advisors , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Using donor images in marketing complex charitable financial planning instruments: An experimental test with charitable gift annuities,"Previous experimental research has demonstrated simple charitable giving decisions can be influenced by examples of another's donation. This article uses a series of experiments to explore how the example of another's complex donation influences interest in a complex charitable financial planning arrangement (a charitable giftannuity). The influence of an example donor varied depending upon the presence and age of the example donor image. A key factor in determining the effectiveness of an example donor image was matching the age of the participant with the age of the example donor image. When the age of the donor image was similar to (differed substantially from) the participant's age, including the donor image generated higher (lower) interest in the complex giftas compared with the overall interest generated when including a non-donor image or no image. This effect from age matching arose through the impact on perceived similarity and identification with the example donor. The value of a donor image for increasing interest in a complex charitable financial planning instrument depends upon its ability to advance the idea that ""people like me do things like this.""","James, Russell N, III, PhD, JD, CFP®", Journal Article,,2019,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Financial planning , Image , Influence , Marketing , Donations , Age",ProQuest One Academic

Results indicated that many respondents were sequencing financial priorities instead of funding them simultaneously, and they were delaying homeownership and retirement savings.

Issues with the Transition Mechanism in the Actuarial Approach to Retirement Spending,"This article highlights some issues with the actuarial retirement withdrawal strategy. There are potential problems with the transition mechanism (present value of an annuity calculation, PVAN) as the retiree ages. With poor initial returns, the actuarial approach does not cut spending quickly enough, due to the mathematics of the annuity formula. Additionally, spending rates can initially be too high or too low depending on the assumed discount rate, which can result in the inefficient spending down of wealth. If a future value is specified as a bequest/safety net, the minimum annual spending over the 30-year period decreases as the future value increases. The effect of a desired future value on annual spending volatility depends on whether the actual subsequent compounding rate is high or low. An increase in the desired future value results in smaller initial withdrawals, with the portfolio's recovery dependent on future returns. As remaining longevity declines with a constant future value, large (small) positive returns as the retiree ages force the transition mechanism (PVAN) to significantly increase (not significantly increase) the annual withdrawal, thus increasing (decreasing) the standard deviation. This effect can possibly turn annual spending negative. Therefore, while the actuarial approach provides solutions to some issues, it also creates new ones.","Johnston, Ken, PhD CFA;Hatem, John, PhD;Carnes, Thomas, PhD;Kosedag, Arman, PhD", Journal Article,,2019,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Standard deviation , Present value , Retirement planning , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic
A Mechanistic Model of Personal Finance,"Widespread personal finance education and advice have not been proven to materially impact the financial health and wellbeing of most households in the U.S. Ironically, a clear and comprehensive understanding of the operating model of how income, expenses, spending and asset accumulation are interconnected has not been seriously explored or defined.

This model provides a robust and actionable tool to help improve understanding of the operating implications and consequences of these decisions.

Financial Planning Client Interaction Theory (FPCIT),"The personal financial planning (PFP) profession has grown substantially since its inception in 1969. While PFP is widely practiced, the recognition of PFP as a formal profession is not widespread. Experts have noted that this is largely due to a lack of PFP-specific theory that illuminates how the PFP profession is unique from its peers. This paper seeks to strengthen the theoretical foundation of PFP by introducing Financial Planning Client Interaction Theory (FPCIT). FPCIT is a theory derived from the very thing that makes PFP special-the financial planner/client relationship. FPCIT explains the utility derived from the interaction between a financial planner and client. FPCIT provides theoretical grounding for quantifying the value of PFP as a professional area of research and practice, which informs PFP stakeholders-financial planners, consumers, academics, regulators, and policy makers-about the benefits and uniqueness of the PFP profession.","Asebedo, Sarah D, PhD, CFP®", Journal Article,,2019,Journal of Personal Finance," Studies , Financial planning , Personal finance , Customer relations , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic
"Coverage, Costs, and Chronic Care","The greatest challenge the new president faces in seeking to address the problem of the uninsured is the growth in health care costs and how to temper those increases. A PriceWarerhouseCoopers report attributes the current and projected cost increases to a hospital building boom and cost shifting by providers from the uninsured, Medicare, and Medicaid patients to those with private insurance. However, researchers at Emory University in Atlanta see the issue differently. They concluded that differences in disease prevalence and treatment rates for 10 of the most costly conditions are key factors in the spending differential between the US and other industrialized nations. Meanwhile, researchers at the Milken Institute measured the economic impact of seven common chronic conditions -- cancer, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart disease, pulmonary conditions, and mental disorders. They found that if changes were made to health-related behaviors, the avoidable treatment costs in 2023 alone would be $217 billion and the gains from productivity improvement would be $905 billion.","Carpenter, Caryl E, MPH, PhD", Feature,Nov,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Health care expenditures , Medical diagnosis , Lifestyles , Research , Health care policy , Cost shifting , Uninsured people , Cost reduction , Insurance coverage , United States--US , Europe",ProQuest One Academic
The 419(e) Plan: Reports of Its Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated,"In Revenue Ruling 2007-65, issued in October 2007, the IRS effectively prohibited the deduction for contributions to welfare benefit plans (sometimes called Sec. 419(e) plans) for preretirement death benefits when funded with any life insurance, including term insurance. In a widely misunderstood Notice issued on the same day (Notice 2007-84), the Service effectively permitted deductions for contributions to 419(e) plans providing postretirement medical and death benefits even when funded with cash value life insurance. Also on that day the Service released a second Notice (Notice 2007-83). Notice 2007-83 declared 419(e) plans that generate deductions for contributions for preretirement benefits funded with cash value life insurance as listed transactions. Yet those plans providing only postretirement benefits--even when funded with cash value life insurance--are not listed transactions. This article dissects these pronouncements and describes what is right, what is wrong, what can still be done, and what should be avoided when dealing with Sec. 419(e) plans.

Cash Value Life Insurance: Steady and Sure Security,"Cash value life insurance (CVLI) deals with the financial ramifications of untimely, inopportune, and certain death continuously and permanently while enabling planning and visions that otherwise would not be financially feasible. CVLI ensures that sum-certain cash, usually tax free, is there whenever death happens. In addition to supplying generally tax-free money to beneficiaries when death occurs, CVLI affords steady and sure cash accumulation accessible to its owners during their lives for the same premium payments. CVLI accumulations may start behind and move forward less quickly compared to more hare-like investments such as stocks. CVLI's steady protection against the financial fallout from the ultimate and certain loss as well as its sure, tax-deferred cash accumulation over time provides effective pre- and postmortem risk management. CVLI furthers optimum financial flexibility through enabling people to earmark its certain payout upon death to designated people and purposes, with or without parameters.","Lynch, J Timothy, JD, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Nov,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Advantages , Cash surrender value , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

First, it is unclear what the value of the annual gifts made by Husband and Wife will be equal to in computing the cost of current life insurance protection provided to an irrevocable trust. Second, in order to avoid taxation consequences on the living values of a policy, Regulation 1.61-22(d)(4)(i) mandates that policy cash value must be retained by the premium payer, not cash surrender value.

The Importance of Separating Family Wealth from the Family Business: Why Lean Is Better and How to Get Fit,"Too many closely held businesses retain and accumulate assets far beyond the reasonable needs of the business. Not only does this expose the assets to a much greater degree of business risks, it also complicates business succession planning and estate tax planning. This article reviews the problems and risks presented by excess accumulation of wealth in a closely held business including an analysis of the limitations of creditor protection benefits provided by corporations. The case is made that numerous business and personal planning objectives can be more easily met if wealth is routinely and systematically withdrawn from the business. Further, a thorough analysis of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that are specifically designed to discourage excess accumulations of wealth in the closely held business are presented. The tax implications and characterization of withdrawals of wealth are also be examined. The article concludes with an examination of specific techniques that can be used to keep the value of the family business commensurate with its business needs and how this can facilitate estate planning and equalization issues.

Recent Court Decision Sheds New Light on ERISA's Top Hat Plan Exemption,"Apart from satisfying the requirements of Code Sec. 409A, one of the principal elements of an executive deferred-compensation plan is that it comes within the protection of the exemption found in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, which is commonly referred to as the ""top hat plan"" exemption.

Life Insurance Considerations in a Rapidly Changing World,"This article challenges the conventional thinking about life insurance. It suggests that a new approach to dealing with life insurance as it is today, rather than using the cliches that have been in use since the author started in the business in 1964, will benefit the consumer. Those cliches will not resonate with the more sophisticated and longer-living life insurance consumer of today. You, the advisors of life insurance products, are challenged to decide what life insurance is right and is irreplaceable for you, your sons and daughters, and your clients in the 21st century.

Inherited Roth IRA Rollovers for Plan Beneficiaries,"In an announcement that surprised many experts, the IRS announced that plan beneficiaries may be able to roll over assets from a qualified plan account directly to an inherited Roth IRA. Of course, spouse beneficiaries have long had liberal rollover options, but with this guidance, one more potential planning opportunity is now available to certain non-spouse beneficiaries. To make a rollover to an inherited Roth IRA under the new guidance, an individual must meet certain other Roth IRA criteria. It is important to remember that a plan amendment is necessary for the rollover option to be available. A plan that does not, by its terms, permit nonspouse rollovers would be in violation of its terms if it makes them. It is important to note that the application of this new guidance affects only beneficiaries of employer retirement plans (i.e., qualified plans, 403(b) tax-sheltered annuities, and eligible Section 457(b) governmental plans), not beneficiaries of IRAs.","Caudill, April, JD, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial planning , Roth IRAs , Roll over , Beneficiaries , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Life Settlements: Know When to Hold and Know When to Fold,"In the final analysis, a life settlement is a diversion of what often is the single most valuable financial asset a client's family or business might receive at an insured's death. It is therefore critical that all parties to the potential transaction follow a recognized set of ""best practices"" to ensure that a professional's ""green light"" or suggestion to proceed with a life settlement is the appropriate choice. Best practices here dictate a formal, objective, and documented two-part decision-making process to answer the question, ""Should my client retain currently owned insurance or should it be sold?""

The Business: Why Sell It When You Can Give It Away?,"At some point, the owner of a closely held business needs to decide whether the business will survive him or her. The potential problem with a sale of stock lies in the income tax treatment both parties may expect to receive. In the case of a family owned business, perhaps it would be better for father to give stock to son. In lieu of receiving payments for the stock in which son is effectively an intermediary, father could receive funds directly from the corporation. Payments to him might be in the form of current or deferred compensation. If father retires from the corporation as he makes the gift of stock, he might be treated as a consultant or as the recipient of a ""pay as you go"" pension. Here are the planning factors to be considered in making gifts: 1. valuation, 2. timing and amount, and 3. estate tax reduction and control.","Reardon, Dennis, JD, LLM, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Guidelines , Gifts , Closely held corporations , Family owned businesses , Stock , Estate planning , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Unique Planning Opportunities for Financial Advisors to Privately Owned ESOP Companies,"An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is the only plan that enables business owners to sell some or all of their company to a tax-exempt trust, maintain control of their business no matter how much stock is sold to the trust, finance the transaction with pretax dollars, and defer or eliminate personal capital gains taxes. Deciding to offer an ESOP is the first step; many more follow. ESOP companies require special long-term financial planning.

Combining Financing Techniques: the Dual Loan Approach,"Combining leveraging techniques to transfer the intrafamily business is a dual loan planning approach to wealth transfer planning, which typically includes an intra family business transfer. This dual loan strategy may be especially helpful in a low-interest rate environment. It may make sense to explore combining different types of loan arrangements, not only to minimize gift taxes and create liquidity, but in particular, to take advantage of the difference in the loan interest rates based on the type of loan. By funding a large life insurance need with a combination of a private financing arrangement and a commercial financing plan through a third-party lender, significant wealth can be sheltered from transfer taxes as tax efficiently as possible while accounting for estate equalization among heirs who do not participate in the business. A privately financed note is linked to the applicable federal rate (AFR), while a premium financing loan from a third-party lender is typically linked to the LIBOR rate plus a point spread. Sometimes the difference between these loan interest rates can be significant. By combining loan arrangements to take into account available cash, the amount of the loan subject to the lower interest rate may be maximized or even locked for a period of time. Likewise, the amount of the loan subject to the higher interest rate may be minimized, and the family business can be transferred efficiently in the wealth transfer and equalization process.

"The Secret to Being a Good Leader Is, There Are No Secrets","The Agency Management Development department of Country Financial offers a three-day Management Academy twice a year for individuals who might be interested in an agency management career. Emphasis is placed on the notion that true leaders inspire, while managers control. A leader will build a culture within the agency that can provide a competitive advantage to help the agency rise above the crowd. High-performing agency managers use the following five tactics to nurture and enforce effective habits: 1. Establish and enforce activity and production standards and expectations that are higher than the industry and company norms. 2. Articulate performance expectations early and often. 3. Teach new representatives that activity is the predictable element of an unpredictable career. 4.

Retirement Security for Women: Understanding the Gender Gap and What to Do about It,"A looming gender gap threatens the retirement security of too many women. Understanding this gap, and more importantly understanding how to help women clients adapt, will enable financial service professionals to serve the needs of their female clients with a greater degree of professionalism and expertise. Social Security is an extremely important source of income for women. However, it comes as no surprise to financial planners that women get less from the system compared to their male counterparts. One obvious solution is to insist on career planning for women that calls for full-time work and less interruption for caregiving. From a policy perspective, planners should also be aware that lower vesting requirements and adopting automatic rollovers upon leaving employment prior to retirement age both would help to increase retirement security for women under GAO projections. Another way to deflect the financial troubles that come with longevity is to counsel women to work for a longer period.","Tacchino, Kenn Beam, JD, LLM;Littell, David A, JD", Editorial,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Women , Gender differences , Guidelines , Retirement planning , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Myth Busters and Conventional Wisdom: What We Know-and Don't Know-about Boomers Nearing Retirement,"Those people who follow the 50+ market are well aware of the conventional wisdom that surrounds the boomers who are nearing retirement -- they are self-serving, they haven't saved, and they plan to work forever. When you dig a little deeper, however, you begin to see another picture. Boomers are not as worried as people thought. They expect to receive an inheritance of between $113,000 and $210,000. They are conservative in their behavior and politics. They probably won't work, and if they do, it will be for a year or two. Many preretirees and retirees, instead of leaving money in their estate, have decided to gift now. One study indicates that 68% of leading-edge boomers are currently providing financial support to an adult child. Based on current projections, the type of support mechanism right at home is just what the boomers want in their old age.","Timmermann, Sandra, EdD", Feature,Sep,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Baby boomers , Consumer behavior , Retirement , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
A Whirlwind of Tax Change: Is Tax Stability in Our Future?,"There have been a number of important tax law changes over the last couple of years.

Another approach appears to be a form of deposition, if not open-ended cross examination. A third method directs people to make a graphical representation of their views about their lives.

A Comprehensive Study of Behavioral Finance,"Anecdotal evidence of irrational and predictably erratic client behavior during the stock market boom of the late '90s and the recent recession abound among financial planners. In this article, we present compelling empirical evidence supporting the belief that irrational investment decision making is a widespread phenomenon. In light of our findings we question the value and utility of using normative models such as Modern Portfolio Theory that assume investor rationality. We also carefully examine the implications for financial service professionals. We suggest that it maybe very desirable for astute financial planners to become versed in the understanding of investor psychology and be able to identify present and potential behavioral biases and to counsel about the perils and consequences of irrational decisions. We also examine the need for planners to work closely with psychologists and behavioral counselors.

Containing Costs by Preventing Them,"It is no secret that the cost of health care in the US has risen more quickly than ever anticipated. From an economic standpoint, the overall cost is the product of the price and the consumption of goods and services. Thus, to truly reduce costs to the entire health care system and not just to any one individual payer, it is necessary to reduce the need and demand for health services. With regard to containing costs, a major goal of preventive care is to reduce the burden of chronic diseases on the health care system. There are three levels of preventive care. Primary prevention attempts to prevent disease in patients who do not yet have any signs or symptoms. Secondary prevention is screening for signs and symptoms of disease states before they become of clinical concern. Tertiary prevention tries to prevent complications in patients who have developed a chronic disease.","Quigley, Alyson Shannon;Carpenter, Caryl E, MPH, PhD", Feature,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Preventive medicine , Health care expenditures , Health care policy , Cost control , Costs , Health insurance , Disease prevention , Chronic illnesses , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Blob Attacks Investment Manager Due Diligence: Invasion of the Perilous Peer Group Bias,"There are many biases in peer groups, some of which can be controlled. But one obscure bias just won't go away, and it is raising havoc with investment manager evaluations. It oozes out from compromises that all peer group providers must make and invades evaluators' judgment, unbeknownst to its unwitting victims. This perilous perpetrator is called classification bias; note it well. Peer group providers establish rules for classifying managers as large or small, value or growth, etc, and then populate their peer groups with managers that meet these criteria. Classification bias feeds on the lack of similarity among the funds that meet these classification rules, thus enveloping manager evaluations with scary ratings. It is an amorphous bias that cannot be made to go away, try as you may.

Tax-Deferred Exchanges of Life Insurance Policies under Sec. 1035: Opportunities and Trouble Spots,"In today's fast-paced marketplace of financial products, the owner of a life insurance policy or annuity contract may decide to switch from an existing product to one considered by the client as more advantageous for a variety of client reasons and planning situations. Given this reality, financial advisors need to be knowledgeable about the role of tax-deferred exchanges of life insurance, endowment contracts, and annuity contracts under Sec. 1035 of the Internal Revenue Code. This article reviews the essential features and technicalities of Sec. 1035 and explores some of the key tax-planning opportunities and challenges in light of current developments. The financial service professional will learn why expertise about Sec. 1035 can avoid jeopardizing the tax benefits associated with other life insurance strategies (e.g., split-dollar arrangements, deferred compensation, buy-sell agreements, key-person protection, and estate planning irrevocable life insurance trusts). In cataloguing the various IRS rulings that address and clarity a number of technical tax issues, the article suggests that advisors and clients would benefit from more cohesive Sec. 1035 regulations, in light of contemporary products, planning strategies, and recent legislative and regulatory developments.

Ruminating on Top-Hat Groups,"Perhaps the most difficult and important question raised by the application of the ERISA select group exemption to nonqualified deferred compensation plans refers to the definition of a plan maintained by an employer primarily for a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Determining the boundaries of the select group is important since a deferred compensation plan may be subject to the entire range of ERISA requirements if a single employee is not within that specified group. With the finalization of regulations to Section 409A in the Internal Revenue Code there seems to be discussion that the use of the terms ""service provider"" and ""service recipient"" in the statute and regulations replaces ""employers"" and ""employees."" Nothing could be further from the truth. The use of ""service provider"" and ""service recipient"" was intentional by the IRS to expand the use of nonqualified plans beyond the traditional employer-employee landscape.","Landsberg, Richard D, JD, LLM, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Definitions , ERISA , Employers , Employees , Executive compensation , Internal Revenue Code , Compensation plans , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Preparer Penalties: Toughened Standard, Increased Penalties Impact Financial Service Professionals","The newly revised tax return preparer penalties have raised the standard for preparers to ""more likely than not,"" meaning a 51% or more belief that each item on the return is correct.

Care and Feeding of Life Insurance in Qualified Plans: Part III,"The third of the three-part series on care and feeding of life insurance in qualified plans is presented. This article explains the tax implications of the policy or death benefits coming out of a plan, the effect of potential rollout strategies, and some valuation issues that arise in the qualified plan context. There are essentially four possible outcomes to having life insurance in a qualified plan: the participant dies while the policy is in the plan, the policy is distributed or is sold out of the plan, or the policy is surrendered. It is clear that since the least tax-favored disposition of life insurance from a qualified plan occurs when the insured dies while the policy is in the plan, an exit strategy is needed. Whether the best strategy is surrender, distribution, or sale of the policy depends on the client's need for coverage, age, potential for estate taxation, and financial objectives.","Caudill, April K, JD, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Jul,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Profit sharing plans , Qualified pension plans , Insurance policies , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Insuring Happily Ever After,"Many people refuse to see what their approaching retirements really look like because this would involve acknowledging some foolishness in their preparations as well as coming to grips with their lack of financial fitness for the future. Individuals must see their retirements in terms of the reality of their assets, sources of income, expenses, and liabilities. Individuals must optimize their preparations in the time remaining before retirement and determine what else they can do to achieve this end. Financial service professionals can facilitate people's retirement reality checks and then motivate them to act. Informed consumers should make the rational decision to secure a meaningful portion of their retirement income sufficient to cover basic, recurring expenses and perhaps expected and planned expenditures, depending on their financial situations, literacy, and risk profiles.

The Supreme Court and Trust Fees,"In Knight, Trustee of William Rudkin Testamentary Trust v Commissioner, US, 128 S.

The case reached the Court on a conflict of decisions between the Second Circuit, which decided Knight and held that the floor was applicable, and the Sixth Circuit, which held that the floor was inapplicable where the trustees lacked experience in managing large sums of money. IRC Section 67 governs application of the 2% floor on miscellaneous deductions. However, the section goes on to provide an exception that states the 2% floor does not apply where costs are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust and which would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust or estate.

The Department of Labor has long been concerned with the lack of fee disclosure and with the potential for conflicts of interest in the compensation arrangements of qualified plan service providers. Late last year, in an effort to create transparency in such arrangements, it proposed sweeping new regulations that would affect nearly all service providers in the qualified plan market. In a profit-sharing plan, life insurance is most commonly purchased in self-directed accounts where the participant wants to meet a life insurance need with pretax dollars or does not have other funds with which to purchase it. When a participant retires, the life insurance contract must either be distributed to the retiree or converted to cash to provide retirement income.","Caudill, April K, JD, CLU, ChFC", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Profit sharing plans , ERISA , Conflicts of interest , Disclosure , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Effective Leadership in a Changing World,"In recent years, practitioners as well as scholarly journals have been singing the praises of leadership. This leadership column will attempt to bridge the practitioner/scholarly worlds by introducing a particular theoretical leadership concept, explaining the underlying theory, discussing how practitioners apply the concept, and asking the readers to evaluate themselves in relation to how other successful practitioners achieve results through the use of the concepts. Traits were found to be excellent predictors of leadership emergence rather than leadership effectiveness. Leaders are afforded the opportunity to lead not because they are appointed by senior managers; they lead because they are perceived and accepted by followers as leaders. Leaders can be classified as transactional or transformational. Transactional leadership builds important influence components between the leader and follower.

The Trend toward Fair Value Accounting,"The requirement to measure some items at fair value has been in the accounting literature for a number of years. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP. Although the debate continues about what is ""fair,"" and there are many obstacles to overcome, the debate is healthy. One of the requirements of Statement No. 157 is to fully explain the use of fair value through substantive footnote disclosures that explain the procedures that management used to arrive at their estimates, as well as the reliability of the assumptions underlying the estimates. Long term, the movement toward a consensus on how to better measure fair value, combined with better disclosure, should ultimately help investors make more informed decisions.","Madray, J Russell, CPA", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial statements , GAAP , Disclosure , Financial accounting standards , Fair value , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

In simple terms, every TDF incorporates the following three components: risky asset pool, protective asset pool, and scheduled shift from risky to protective through time called a glide path. The magnitude of transfer from risky to protective asset should be determined using the principles of liability-driven investing. So far the competition for target date business has been based on performance and has led most to favor a very gentle application of the brakes, leaving the TDF in a substantial risky asset allocation at target date.

"Is an Alternative Minimum Tax Resolution on the Horizon? Or Will the AMT Continue to Mean ""Add More Tax?""","The alternative minimum tax (AMT) has been a separate method of calculating income tax liability. Although often referred to as a ""parallel"" system of income taxation, the AMT has quickly become a substitute for a ""flat tax rate"" system. The AMT occurs when the calculation for the AMT results in a higher tax liability than the calculation for the regular income tax. The AMT calculation starts with a taxpayer's taxable income, which is then adjusted to reflect the impact of tax-preference items and includes the elimination or reduction of certain deductions and/or credits. One might argue that the AMT is an incredibly antifamily piece of legislation in that it penalizes large families by forcing them to add back their personal and dependency exemptions. According to the Joint Conference Committee on Taxation, repeal of the AMT would deprive the government of $611 billion of revenues over the next decade.","Brinker, Thomas M, Jr, LLM, CPA/PFS, ChFC, AEP", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Alternative minimum tax , Taxation , Tax rates , Liabilities , Tax exemptions , Income taxes , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Shakespeare's King Lear: Looking for an Estate Planner,"Lear's is a classic case of a failed estate plan and raises at least three important ethical issues for planners: 1. What do you do about the conflicts of interest that arise from representing multiple clients from the same family? 2. What responsibilities does a planner have to a client who is either a fool or has diminished capacity? 3. Is it wise to rely on familial ties of affection and love to overcome the emotions of greed or envy that arise when estates are to be settled? Love does not conquer all, and protests of love are not always to be believed. Adequate wealth management and estate planning must take into account the hard realities of life. It is important to plan realistically for long-term care, organ donations, living wills, multiple representation conflicts, confidentiality limits, powers of attorney, and other such matters.","Duska, Ronald F, PhD;Ragatz, Julie Anne", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Ethics , Emotions , Conflicts of interest , Wealth management , Estate planning , Blood & organ donations , Powers of attorney , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Create Values-Based Communications to Enhance Success of Employee Health Plans,"Health care is, of course, a major topic in the upcoming presidential election. Health care costs now are approaching 20% of the US gross national product and are quickly on the way to becoming the biggest single expense of any employee benefit. But whether the answer is giving the government more control or letting consumers decide their health care destinies, the need for people to make appropriate health care decisions has never been greater. Health care is an issue that involves two of people's most personal and emotional areas of concern: their money and their futures. Consumer values, according to a January 2008 report from Employee Benefit Research Institute, are powerful motivators in the psychology of decision making. Promoting positive behaviors that lead to general wellness (rather than focusing on risky behaviors that lead to costly medical conditions such as heart disease and diabetes) seems a natural approach.","Brenner, Bryan K, REBC", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Health care expenditures , Health care policy , Decision making , Employee benefits , Gross National Product--GNP , Wellness programs , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"The More Things Change, the More Life Insurance Remains the Solution","Life insurance provides unrestricted, ready funds tax efficiently and for cents on the dollar in the event of the ultimate loss. Life insurance money enables people to have the time and opportunity to grieve, work through, and emerge from devastating loss. Life insurance money is the solution to myriad family, business, charitable, and estate issues and opportunities. Co-owners, lenders, investors, and employees have known for decades the devastating financial impact the deaths of key people can have on the businesses they run. Key-person life insurance continues to be the most effective way to ensure that resources are available to manage such financial effects and to buy the time required to transition through the loss. Married or unmarried, different or same-sex couples need financial security for themselves and their families. Parents can direct life insurance cash to equalize treatment among children, cover gaps in inheritances, and free illiquid assets from debt encumbrances.","Lynch, J Timothy, JD, CLU, ChFC", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Affirmative action , Risk management , Life insurance , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
IRS Provides Guidance on Correction Methods for Some Operational Failures under Section 409A,"Apart from extending the deadline for documentary compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, that IRS Notice 2007-86 confirmed for a second time that the IRS intended to issue guidance that would provide correction methods for certain failures to comply with the Section 409A requirements in operation. On Dec 26, 2007, the IRS issued Notice 2007-100, as the first stage of what will hopefully be a robust program for correcting unintentional operational failures (UOFs) under Section 409A. The corrections generally require repayment of the amount involved. There are information and reporting requirements that also apply to the transitional correction method. The IRS would continue to rely on the examination of the relevant tax returns. The IRS listed numerous conditions that would have to be satisfied under its potential program. The correction program made available by the Notice is a welcome development.","Schneider, Paul, JD, LLM", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Compliance , Internal Revenue Code , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Disadvantages of Not Being Married: What Financial Planners Should Know,"By now, most financial planners are aware that same-sex couples require special attention because they are not entitled to the legal and financial benefits of marriage. The disadvantages of not being married are grouped into five areas: legal, insurance, taxation, retirement planning, and estate planning. Clarifying examples of each disadvantage are offered as well as suggested remedies, if available. While the discussion primarily addresses same-sex couples, it also pertains to heterosexual couples who choose not to marry. Gaining a deeper understanding of the disadvantages same-sex couples face should help financial planners who deal with this segment of our society.

The Class of 1968: The Oldest Boomers at Age 62,"Tom Brokaw, the author and NBC News commentator, has written a new book called Boom! Voices of the Sixties. Drawing from his many years in broadcast journalism, it is a personal reflection on the 1960s, coupled with interviews with individuals who lived through and shaped the public consciousness. There is no doubt that the 1960s were watershed years, and the members of the Class of 1968 were on the leading edge. Contrary to what people expected, the close to 3 million members of the Class of 1968, the oldest boomers, are quite conservative politically, socially, and economically. The Class of 1968 is in transition, a time when things are shifting for them as they move from their primary career to retirement. A big question at age 62 is whether to take Social Security immediately at a reduced amount or wait until they are eligible for full benefits at age 66.","Timmermann, Sandra, EdD", Feature,May,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Older people , Values , Polls & surveys , Transitions , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Nuts and Bolts of Sec. 409A and Split Dollar,"Section 409A provides that amounts deferred for all years under a nonqualified deferred-compensation plan are currently includible in gross income to the extent that they are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and have not been previously included in gross income. It is important to understand up front that Sec. 409A does not apply to split-dollar plans that only provide death benefits to or on behalf of the insured employee. Likewise, split-dollar plans that fall under the short-term deferral exception of Sec. 409A are nor impacted. Transitional relief is afforded to grandfathered split-dollar plans in Notice 2007-34. Therefore, certain modifications can be made to split-dollar arrangements without losing grandfather status under the split-dollar rules. The applicability of Sec. 409A to a split-dollar plan is neither positive nor negative. It is what it is.","Landsberg, Richard D, JD, LLM, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Tax deductions , Nonqualified pension plans , Split dollar arrangements , Compensation plans , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
State Health Insurance Reform Efforts and ERISA,"When Congress enacted the Employment Retirement Income Security Act in 1974, it would have been hard to foresee the frustration that law would cause states and localities today as they seek to assure that more of their citizens are covered by health insurance. But even if ERISA's method was to restrain states and localities in certain respects, its purpose was always to encourage employers to do more for their employees. In today's environment, ERISA may be doing just the opposite by providing employers with a weapon with which to ward off attempts by states and localities to ask employers to do more. Reading between the lines of the state initiatives as they seek to circumvent ERISA and shift costs to the federal treasury, one further conclusion can be reached: If there is to be truly universal insurance coverage for Americans, the solution must be found at the federal level.","Fichter, Andrew J, JD, PhD", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Reforms , ERISA , Employers , Insurance coverage , Health insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Life Insurance Enables Intangible Legacies,"Ethical wills are in vogue because of their power. Instruction letters are in favor because of their practicality.

More people realize that their legacies go beyond transferring their tangible treasure. Ethical wills have powerful effects on both their makers and recipients.

Care and Feeding of Life Insurance in Qualified Plans: Part I,"The first part of a series on care and feeding of life insurance in qualified plans is presented. One of the first obstacles is addressing the objection of why life insurance would be purchased in a qualified plan, when the tax-deferred growth in a life insurance policy would seem to unnecessarily duplicate the tax-deferred growth available in a qualified plan trust. The amount of life insurance that can be purchased in a qualified plan account is subject to an ""incidental benefit"" limit. As a general rule, profit-sharing plans may permit the distribution of funds that have been accumulated for two years or more, or by participants with at least five years of plan participation. The availability of policy cash values is considerably more limited while life insurance is in a qualified plan compared to a personally owned contract.","Caudill, April K, JD, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Profit sharing plans , Qualified pension plans , Life insurance , Tax deferred privileges , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
To What Extent Is Your Client Allowed to Be Discriminated Against Because of Age?,"The financial planner needs to be mindful of the federal age discrimination law so that he or she can assist clients who feel that they are being discriminated against based on age. In particular, employee benefit specialists need to be cognizant of how the ADEA (Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967) intersects with the benefit programs they are designing for clients. The ADEA protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older from employment discrimination based on age. Of particular concern to financial service professionals are the rules for employee benefits. As a general rule, the ADEA bars discrimination on the basis of age in connection with employee benefits. Any individual who believes that his or her employment rights have been violated may file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Many states and localities have antidiscrimination laws and agencies responsible for enforcing those laws.","Tacchino, Kenn Beam, JD, LLM", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Client relationships , Employee benefits , Employment , Age Discrimination in Employment Act 1967-US , Age discrimination , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Happy Birthday: The First Boomer Chooses Early Social Security Retirement,"On Jan 1, 2008, the first boomer celebrated her 62nd birthday. Kathy Casey-Kirschling is generally recognized as the first boomer. Although eligibility for full Social Security benefits is rising from age 65 to age 66-67 for all boomers, with the specific age linked to one's year of birth, eligibility for early but reduced Social Security benefits remains at age 62. So it's not surprising that Kathy's 62nd birthday was a well-covered event as she became the first boomer to become eligible to claim Social Security benefits. It is apparent that the century-long pattern of earlier-than-age-65 retirement is changing, and the factors leading to this change are themselves likely to endure substantially over the years during which boomers will make their retirement decisions.","Cutler, Neal E, PhD", Feature,Mar,2008,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Baby boomers , Gerontology , Social security , Retirement planning , Age , Birthdays , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The retirement planning opportunities include options for small business owners that permit them to shelter an additional $100,000 or more in their qualified retirement plans for little or no additional cost to fund employee benefits.

The Declining Players in the Retirement Income Game: Risks and Policy Implications,"A shifting retirement income landscape poses challenges for individuals seeking to achieve a secure retirement The key shifts are longer life spans, the contraction of Social Security, modest 401(k) balances, few other financial assets, declining asset returns, the competition to retirement saving from rising college costs, and the wild card of soaring health care expenses. This article focuses on the implications of these developments for the well-being of individuals and for government. The article first describes the outlook for retirement security using the National Retirement Risk Index. This index measures the portion of households in the baby boom and subsequent generations that will not be able to maintain their standard of living in retirement. Sensitivity analyses using the index show the extent to which that outlook could be improved by working longer and by boosting retirement income. Since neither goal can be achieved without government initiatives, the article then explores the role that government can play in encouraging continued employment. Here the most important change is to increase Social Security's earliest eligibility age. The government could also take steps to boost retirement income by making 401(k) plans work better, fostering the use of the house as a source of retirement income, and perhaps introducing a new tier of retirement saving. Finally, even if all of the changes are adopted, further cuts in benefits to close Social Security's long-term financing shortfall would leave most people with little base of support, so the article considers the option of maintaining scheduled benefits.

The Alphabet Soup of Automatic Enrollment: Comfort Food or Empty Calories?,"Twenty years after the McDonald's Corporation broke new ground by automatically enrolling participants in its 401(k) plan, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) breathed new life into the practice by creating several new plan design options and providing for federal preemption of state laws that prevent withholding absent a participant's affirmative election. While various sources estimate these changes will add $70 billion to $2 trillion to retirement accounts over the next 25 years, automatic enrollment may not be the panacea to America's shortfall in retirement savings that some suggest. In addition to many potentially expensive compliance traps for the unwary plan sponsor, automatic enrollment plans may risk exacerbating the common misconception among American workers that they will have a sufficient nest egg on which to retire.

How to Make Pay for Performance Pay Off,"In practice, the process of connecting pay to performance may be far trickier than it first appears. In fact, implementing these pay schemes can be very complicated. Pay-for-performance companies must be innovative in their own setting in order to be successful. Because of reliance upon management by objectives, they are highly decentralized and enjoy a sense of mutual trust and high commitment. The vast majority of executives, in general, also want pay for performance. Financial rewards in a fast, ever-changing business environment could undermine a company's ability to build trust and commitment unless management and executives have an honest discussion of their mutual expectations, which can be very difficult to do. To create synergy in pay for performance requires more than a concept and a strategy. The pay-for-performance alignment process, of necessity, should be cyclic and top-down driven. Annual pay-for-performance plans, if properly designed, call for incentives to rise and fall with company performance.","Landsberg, Richard D, JD, LLM, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Nov,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Monetary incentives , Pay for performance , Management by objectives , Executive compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Benefits of Qualified Domestic Trusts in Estate Tax Planning for Non-U.S. Citizen Spouses,"Under Internal Revenue Code 2056A, a non-U.S. citizen spouse can gain substantial benefit from the continued deferral of estate taxes on assets received from a deceased spouse. For assets that are in excess of the estate tax exclusion, this can be accomplished through the use of a qualified domestic trust (QDOT), provided that certain rules are followed. In addition to reviewing the strict and very unique aspects of administering a QDOT, this article will also examine the complex tax calculations that are required not only during the administration of the trust, but also at the time of termination. In light of the changing estate tax laws, fewer individuals may utilize this estate planning tool than has historically been the case. With that being said, although many will no longer require the use of a QDOT those still making use of this valuable tool will want to be well versed in the strict requirements that must be met with the administration of such a trust.

The New Economy,"The recent debacle in the financial markets has opened up a plethora of issues that require serious attention from all market participants. Perhaps the most serious concern is the emergence of a ""mixed"" economy where both ""public"" and government-owned enterprises will coexist with ""private"" enterprises. The historical performances of such economies have been fairly dismal. The debacle is also bound to usher in additional regulation of financial markets. The new regulations are likely to focus on ways to control the possibilities of similar failures in the future.

"The Public Wants a New National Health Insurance Plan, or Does It?","In May 2009, the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute fielded its 12th annual Health Confidence Survey (HCS). The HCS is an ongoing, annual series of nationally representative public opinion polls that carefully measure the public's confidence in and satisfaction with health care and, more critically, the financial aspects of health care. Analysis reveals a public that is satisfied with its personal health insurance but also supports ""a new public health insurance plan that anyone can purchase"" -- results that are likely to encourage rather than settle the national debate.

Exploring the Use of Equity Collars in Asset Allocation: A Simulation Approach,"The 2008 market meltdown poses fundamental questions about investor reliance on diversification as a tool to manage risk in investment strategies. This article demonstrates that the use of asset allocation schemes alone is not sufficient to reduce portfolio risk. The analysis of the effects of changing correlation and volatility regimes suggests that management of the diversification effect is necessary. In addition to asset allocation decisions, attention should be paid to the implementation of more effective hedges. This research shows that the implementation of a zero-cost equity collar shows promise in managing investment risk as well as providing better risk-to-return ratios. The collar not only outperformed across a wide range of asset mixes on a risk/return basis but also provided a predetermined downside boundary on wealth. Our findings demonstrate that the holding period and the width of the collar have an impact on the investor's overall risk/return performance.

Insurance Industry Leadership Challenges,"The recession has added many challenges to the already full plate faced by insurance executives. There is no question that changes are coming in the regulation of insurers. Even before the recession, the SEC proposed regulating indexed annuities as securities. It is still aggressively pursuing that issue (Rule 151A). Now that the regulatory shortcomings that exacerbated the recession are exposed, it is clear that there will be significant new regulatory constraints imposed on most financial institutions, including insurers. The federal government bailout of financial institutions is a good example of the questionable outcome of a federal program. Insurers are having to decide if they are eligible for bailout funds and if so, if they want to seek such funds. The lobbying and legislative battles could end up being a life-or-death matter for the health insurance products of the company. It will be imperative that the health insurance industry mount an aggressive effort to preserve its very viability.","Graves, Edward E, MA, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Lobbying , Bailouts , SEC regulations , Financial institutions , Annuities , Recessions , Health insurance , Insurance industry , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Post-Stimulus Bill Era of Executive Compensation,"For more than a quarter century excessive executive compensation has been the subject of public concern and regulatory and legislative responses. The most significant legislative action to date has been the enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the ""stimulus bill"") on Feb 17, 2009. The stimulus bill prohibits a TARP recipient from paying or accruing any bonus, retention award, or incentive compensation to certain covered executives during the TARP restriction period. A TARP recipient is prohibited from adopting any arrangement that would encourage manipulation of its reported earnings to enhance the compensation of any of its employees. The CEO and CFO of each TARP recipient must provide a written certification of compliance with the executive compensation requirements imposed by the stimulus bill, other than the limitation on luxury expenditures. One of the company's senior risk officers should now become a member of the compensation planning team.","Schneider, Paul J, JD, LLM", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Wage & salary administration , Compliance , American Recovery & Reinvestment Act 2009-US , Executive compensation , TARP funds , Long term , Federal legislation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Reality, Life Insurance, and Recovery","Cash value life insurance (CVLI) is a cornerstone asset because it fits economic reality and human financial behavior. Now that people have viscerally experienced the financial dark side they are likely to realize CVLI is part of a fundamental foundation for rebuilding their security. People have known that risk involves the possibility of loss. Investors have been aware that risk and return are closely related. The more accurate the view of reality economics and human financial behaviors, the more life insurance will be seen as an important means to obtain the results required for financial security. CVLI operates as a commitment tool that motivates people to continue to invest their premiums notwithstanding changing financial circumstances, competing demands for their attention and funds, or discipline lapses. Plus, the product's safe, dependable accumulations and insurance benefits enable individuals to allocate resources to higher-risk, potentially higher-return investments.","Lynch, J Timothy, JD, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial planning , Risk management , Life insurance , Liquidity , Insurance premiums , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Residential Mortgage and the American Dream,"Most of what people believe about residential mortgages has its roots in the Great Depression. Late last year there were signs that the US was headed toward another depression. For 2008, foreclosures were up 80% over 2007, which itself was a dismal year for foreclosures. The headlines about mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures have indirectly reinforced the belief that home equity is a financial security goal. Home buyers are encouraged by some financial advisors to make as large a down payment as they can afford. They are also encouraged to opt for biweekly payment schedules instead of monthly payment schedules. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, a large down payment and the accelerated buildup of equity produced by 15- and 20-year mortgages and biweekly payments enhance the security of mortgage lenders. Whenever one of your clients or acquaintances buys or sells residential real estate, you can have a conversation about cash value life insurance.","Kozol, George B, JD, LLM, CLU", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Mortgages , Tax deductions , Foreclosure , Down payments , Financial planners , Home financing , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Life Settlement Industry Tests State Insurable Interest Rules,"As world financial markets become more interdependent, the demand for uncorrelated investments continues to increase. Institutional investors and sophisticated individual investors are searching for investment returns that are not linked to bonds, equities, or commodities. In the late 1990s investment bankers and hedge fund investment managers turned to the secondary market for life insurance to create such an investment class--life settlement-backed securities. The demand for the new securities had been so great, prior to the financial crisis that began last fall, that syndicators and promoters required amounts of life insurance on older-age individuals that exceeded the supply available through normal functioning of the secondary market. The unprecedented demand for life policies on older-aged individuals produced life insurance applications and arrangements that tested the boundaries of state insurable interest laws. This article will explain the tension between life settlement-backed securities and state insurable interest laws. The article also will overview regulatory developments that should assuage this tension.

The Economics of Human Life Value Estimates: The Income Distribution Project,"This paper introduces the Income Distribution Project, a free-for-use Internet site created to aid financial service professionals in making initial decisions regarding the appropriate approach in generating estimates of future earnings for an individual. Depending on the occupation and the earnings profile of the subject and its relationship to his/her occupational peers, the necessary analytic rigor may vary significantly in generating valid and defensible estimates. However, without first committing to a relatively elaborate analysis, which comes with attendant costs, a professional often cannot know whether a simpler, cheaper analysis would have sufficed. The information included at the Income Distribution Project provides professionals with a means to answer this question prior to a significant commitment of resources.

Entrepreneurial Approach to Benefits Can Improve Cost Containment and Outcomes,"The looming financial shortfall in Medicare and Social Security has driven the national dialog on health care reform. Whether the future holds a single-payer, government-backed system or a new variation of employer-financed plans, health care is likely to change dramatically in the coming decade. One answer could be by taking a more entrepreneurial, free-market approach to health care benefits. Marketplace forces, where prices are set by scarcity, value, and product differentiation, can hold down the ever-rising cost of health care for employers and their employees. Entrepreneurs look for innovative new products or new versions of existing ones to tap into market demand. Creative health care and benefit solutions likewise can cut costs while increasing consumer satisfaction. By instituting benefit programs that combine the entrepreneurial principles of creativity, communication, and choice, consultants can affect the future of health care at the local level, company by company, employee by employee.","Brenner, Bryan K, REBC", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Health care policy , Entrepreneurs , Customer satisfaction , Product differentiation , Cost control , Free markets , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Petitioners (a coalition of insurance companies and independent marketing organizations) asked the court to review Rule 151A, published by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2009 holding that fixed index annuities in which the nonguaranteed interest rate credited is ""more likely than not"" to exceed the rate guaranteed in the contract are not annuities eligible for exemption from SEC authority under Section 3(a)(8) of the Securities Act of 1933, and are, thus, securities subject to SEC registration and regulation. The court remanded the rule to the SEC for reconsideration.

"Gifts, Loans, and Advancements Take Center Stage in This Economy","During the past year, the recession has brought many people to financial positions not previously experienced. During this period, people have seen a spate of intrafamily loans, gifts, and advancements driven by current financial needs rather than longer term estate planning goals. While these transactions frequently have been generated by the immediate circumstances of the younger generation, they directly affect the estate planning of the senior generation. Parents may be lenders of last resort and, in some cases, of first resort, as they assist their children in the purchase of a home. Some parents might simply make a gift, rather than a loan, if there were no such thing as the tax law. A parent may make an outright gift in excess of the $13,000 annual exclusion amount to an adult child.

Choosing the Optimal Initial Income Tax Year End for Estates: Comparing the Calendar and Fiscal Year Option,"Financial service professionals are often caught in a dilemma between balancing the needs of estate administration/planning and income tax planning. With estate and trust income tax rates at confiscatory levels, an advisor may believe that it is always prudent to choose a calendar year end for ease and consistency of reporting. However, the savings associated with tax deferral can be staggering. Advisors are keenly aware that an estate comes into existence for federal income tax purposes at the death of the decedent. However, this does not imply that the date of death is the first day of the taxable year of the estate, because this would result in an overlap of one day between the decedent's final return and the estate's first year. In selecting the appropriate fiscal year, the estate should also consider the filing status of the surviving spouse.","Brinker, Thomas M, Jr, CPA/PFS, ChFC, AEP;Harvey, Christopher M, JD, LLM, CPA", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Selection , Tax rates , Fiscal years , Tax planning , Income taxes , Estate planning , Estate administration , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Who Deserves What?,"In George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, later turned into the musical My Fair Lady, Alfred P. Doolittle, whom Professor Higgins dubs ""The Most Original Moralist"" in England, designates himself as one of the ""undeserving poor."" In the current financial crisis, questions arise in the public sphere about who ""deserves"" what help. Distribution according to need is part and parcel of most cultures. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is what underlies one's impulse to charity. The second criterion is based on the assumption that one deserves what one has worked for. People should distribute according to merit. Finally, there is a third criterion for deserving. It is that the goods should be distributed equally. Helping those in need who freely chose not to provide for themselves creates what is known as moral hazard. This is why equality of opportunity is favored over equality of results.","Duska, Ronald F, PhD", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Morality , Equality , Social support , Economic crisis , Distribution , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Generational Reciprocity: What Does It Mean in the 21st Century?,"Today, with so many families feeling the economic pinch, the idea of an intergenerational household may have more traction than ever before. While a shared household might never be the norm the way it was in the past, generational reciprocity nevertheless is top of mind for the legions of new grandparents -- the boomers -- who are prepared to help, and for their adult children who welcome their assistance. There are, of course, financial aspects to intergenerational reciprocity as well. Young adults these days appear to have a deeper relationship with their parents that goes far beyond a financial one. Studies indicate that their values are more closely aligned to their boomer parents' values than generations in the past. The end result may well be that family members will find new ways to help each other and there will be more reciprocity of friends helping friends.","Timmermann, Sandra, EdD", Feature,Sep,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Families & family life , Households , Intergenerational relationships , Young adults , Baby boomers , Social conditions & trends , Reciprocity , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Roth Planning Opportunities in a Troubled Economy,"When retirement account values are down, credit is tight, and home values are dropping, it might seem as though helpful planning opportunities are in short supply. But for some clients the time may be right for strategies that take advantage of the lower asset values to generate long-range income tax reduction and wealth transfer opportunities. For those who have seen their IRA values decimated by recent market losses, a conversion of a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA can be a compelling strategy. In order to make a Roth conversion in 2009, the individual must have modified adjusted gross income of less than $100,000. In 2010, the $100,000 income limit and the limitation for those married filing separately is scheduled to be repealed, so that taxpayers at any income level may convert.

The revenue ruling is important because determining the amount and timing of losses from these schemes is factually difficult and dependent on the prospect of recovering the lost money.

There were many demands on Franklin Roosevelt's administration for relief for the unemployed, veterans, and the elderly. Although assistance with the costs of health care was among those demands, unemployment insurance was the top priority, followed by retirement benefits for the elderly.

"The ""Backdoor"" Roth IRA","As part of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, Congress eliminated the income restriction on converting to a Roth IRA starting in 2010. Currently one is prohibited from converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA if modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds $100,000. Congress did not include a time limit to the new Roth conversion rules. And given that looser conversion rules are likely to result in more conversions and thus more tax dollars, it would seem unlikely under the current administration that Congress would tighten the rules in the near future. When the conversion occurs, ordinary income tax will be due on any investment income earned before the conversion. Since the backdoor Roth IRA does not allow the holder to make future annual contributions due to income limitations, comparing it with investments that allow future contributions is not appropriate.","Adelman, Saul W, PhD;Cross, Mark L, PhD", Feature,Jul,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Conversion , Investment income , Tax legislation , Roth IRAs , Income taxes , Tax increases , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Funding Special Needs Trusts with Retirement Benefits,"One of the most challenging areas of estate planning involves protecting the interests of individuals with special needs. When family circumstances require that retirement assets be used to fund a special needs trust after the parent's death, the effect of the trust's beneficiary and remainder beneficiaries and the impact of minimum distributions must be taken into account. According to a 2005 US Census Bureau survey, 54.4 million Americans, or nearly one in five, live with some type of disability. For this purpose, ""disability"" refers to a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.

Why Do We Keep Selling Insurance Products As Investments?,"Investment and insurance are very different things. The instruments designed to facilitate them are fundamentally different, as are the logic and math that people should employ to gauge their value. Investment is all about profit. They buy an investment because they believe that they'll be better off after doing so than they would be if they had not bought it. They do so with the expectation of gaining more money. Insurance, in contrast, is all about loss. They buy insurance not because they expect to profit from owning it, but because they wish to avoid losing money by reason of experiencing a specific event that will cause them economic loss. So, if they regard an immediate life annuity as an investment, it would seem reasonable for them to note that the interest rate used to determine the amount of the annuity payments is locked in at contract inception.","Olsen, John L, CLU, ChFC, AEP", Editorial,Jul,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Investment plans , Life annuities , Interest rates , Profits , Insurance premiums , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Home Mortgage Prepayment: The Better Roth IRA?,"Workers often have a wide array of corporate- and noncorporate-sponsored plans that allow them to save for retirement on a tax-advantaged basis. The prepayment of a home mortgage, which is most similar in character to the Roth IRA, is usually not considered a tax-advantaged retirement savings option, perhaps because investors do not see or comprehend the future revenue or retirement resources (cash flows) prepayment creates. Our comparison between the prepayment of a home mortgage and contributing to a Roth IRA is strictly from a wealth maximization standpoint. Mortgage prepayment is found to be an effective and essentially equivalent alternative to a Roth IRA, especially for people no longer eligible for Roth contributions due to phase-out rules.

Predictable Unpredictability of In Terrorem Clauses,"A recent case in the Philadelphia, PA area, the Estate of James E. Beasley, Sr., illustrates the durability of an aged testamentary provision, the ""in terrorem"" clause. In terrorem clauses, also called no-contest clauses, are used to discourage, by threat of disinheritance, beneficiaries from challenging the terms of a deceased's will. Over the years, the intrinsic issues emanating from documents containing in terrorem language are countless. Although at the time of this writing, the Beasley case is still working its way through the court system, the continuing use and applicability of in terrorem clauses affirms their enduring pursuit. This article discusses some historical aspects of in terrorem provisions and modern efforts to balance the intentions of testators and the rights of beneficiaries.

Gift and Estate Planning for Foreign Nationals,"Greater international mobility means that many non-U.S. citizens may reside permanently abroad but own U.S. assets, or they may have migrated to the U.S. but are not, for a variety of reasons, U.S. citizens. There are also a large number of married couples in which one spouse is a U.S. citizen but the other one is not. This article focuses on how the current U.S. transfer tax laws apply to noncitizen individuals and married couples with assets and/or investments in the U.S. In some situations, the transfer taxes can be almost draconian on family wealth so the article explores options in eliminating or reducing these transfer taxes.

Dealing with Financial Crises: Burden or Opportunity?,"Clients faced mounting financial losses and were turning to the advisor in frustration, looking either for some guidance or to accuse their advisors of failing in their responsibility. Hours were spent in consultation trying to calm fears and give advice. The author was reminded of an approach to hard times taken by the ancient Roman philosopher, Seneca. Seneca belonged to a school of philosophers, the Stoics, who were particularly good at addressing the problem of suffering and dealing with hard times. At any rate, Seneca had two bits of advice for living a happy life. The first is to be resigned to the fact that at times you must endure suffering in your life. The second bit of advice that Seneca and his fellow Stoics would give is to be optimistic. A financial plan simply geared to making more wealth is not a finished plan. The plan must have a further purpose.","Duska, Ronald F, PhD", Commentary,May,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Losses , Responsibilities , Client relationships , Recessions , Philosophers , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Coping with the ""Great Recession"": A To-Do List for Retirement Planning Professionals","The ""Great Recession,"" as some are calling it, means anything but business as usual for those whose life's work includes helping clients plan for and manage their retirements.

Charging Order-Protected Entities and Their Role in Wealth Preservation,"This article explains and explores the value of charging order-protected entities like the limited liability company (LLC). The charging order helps protect nondebtor partners and LLC members from the ""outside"" creditors of other partners/members by preventing unwanted partnerships and premature liquidation. Assets held in certain partnerships and LLCs are afforded an additional layer of asset protection not available to other types of legal entities. Thus, charging order-protected entities are a valuable vehicle for conducting business and investment operations because they help protect one's interest in such entities, preserve wealth, and maintain the autonomy of an entity's operations.

New Additions to the Internal Revenue Service's Section 409A Guidance,"Following a respite from the seemingly never-ending barrage of rules and regulations relating to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, this article will again address two new pieces of Sec. 409A guidance that the IRS issued during the waning days of 2008. The IRS initially published guidance adopting an interim correction program for operational failures under Sec. 409A at the end of 2007. This initial program was limited in scope and was intended to bridge the gap between the issuance of the interim program and the development of a full-blown correction program. Notice 2008-115 represents the latest installment in a series of notices issued during the period from 2005 through 2007 that provided interim reporting and wage withholding guidance with regard to nonqualified deferred compensation under Sec. 409A. The notice also addresses how to determine the amount includible in gross income.","Schneider, Paul J, JD, LLM", Feature,May,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Internal Revenue Code -- Section 409A , Gross income , Nonqualified pension plans , Tax regulations , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Understanding the RMD Holiday,"In a response to dismal market results and poor economic news, Congress took the unprecedented step late last year of enacting a waiver of the required minimum distribution (RMD) rules for many plans and most taxpayers over 70 1/2 during the 2009 calendar year. The waiver was part of a broader package of pension technical corrections, known as the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008. The RMD relief suspends both lifetime and after-death distribution requirements for IRAs and defined-contribution plans for one year. Distributions from defined-benefit plans are not suspended in 2009. It is important to note that the RMD suspension changes the required beginning date of non-Roth IRA owners and defined-contribution plan participants who would otherwise have been required to start distributions by Apr 1, 2010. With lower account values, those who can convert to a Roth IRA may do so at a reduced cost, making this a prime opportunity for long-term tax planning.","Caudill, April, JD, CLU, ChFC, AEP", Feature,May,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Waivers , Income distribution , Profit sharing plans , Tax planning , Defined contribution plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Life-Event Segmenting Offers Optimization of Benefit Effectiveness,"The advent of consumer-directed options such as health savings accounts has seen a movement toward more marketing-oriented employee communications based on typical demographic segmentation by age, sex, and economic strata.

In the evolving role of advisor, employee benefit providers are in the unique position to not only help employers choose the right programs but to help employees choose the best options for their stage of life. As the financial crisis becomes the topic of virtually every conversation and news report, anxiety about the future impels employees to seek more relevant information about benefit options.

Protecting the Most Vulnerable from Financial Abuse: What Should We Know?,"Some weather the aging process very well, keeping active and engaged right up until their last breath. But others experience frailty and cognitive declines, which make it difficult for them to make clear decisions on their own. Their vulnerability can cause them to be prey to a variety of predators -- salespeople, telephone solicitors, lawyers, financial service professionals, home care workers, and various con artists. A recent study from the MetLife Mature Market Institute and the National Committee for the Prevention of Elder Abuse, Broken Trust: Elders, Families and Finances, was designed to determine the annual financial loss by victims of financial elder abuse by analyzing news feeds.

The Facts of Death,"Despite increasing life expectancies and longevity risk, death still happens; sometimes prematurely and oftentimes unexpectedly or inopportunely. Surpassing valuable benefits that can help people avoid outliving their assets especially in times of economic uncertainty life insurance remains the premier way to provide for death's financial aftermath from its inception until its fulfillment. Adults are passing on unhealthy behaviors to their offspring. These include eating poorly, engaging in little or no physical activity, and maintaining an unhealthy weight. In fall 2008 cancer was projected to take the lives of 565,650 Americans. The facts of death play out within demographic and related realities. Debt obligations and investment losses have devastated both national and personal economic lives. It is both empowering and comforting for people to realize they can deal with the financial impacts of death's unavoidability at the same time and with the same resources used to address longevity risk and pursue potentially higher returns from riskier investments.","Lynch, J Timothy, JD, CLU, ChFC", Feature,May,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Death & dying , Financial planning , Life expectancy , Risk management , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity to Engage in Estate Tax Planning,"Legislation has been proposed to set the estate tax rate at 45% and the lifetime exclusion at $3.5 million per person. The bill will also limit the valuation discounts for transfers of interests in closely held entities such as family limited partnerships. The potential new law is only one reason why financial service professionals must educate clients and estate planning team members about this historic opportunity to engage in estate tax planning. Other reasons include asset values reduced by the current troubled economy, the lowest interest rates ever required by the IRS, and high valuation discounts for appraisals of limited partnerships and similar interests.

Beyond Income Replacement,"The most basic use for life insurance has always been income replacement. Income replacement needs were especially prominent during the post-World War II era. The demographics and economics of this era indicate a period when a significant percentage of total life insurance sales related to replacing the civilian income of returning GIs. The interplay of declining asset values -- precipitated by the severe recession -- and the increasing estate tax exemption has created serious planning problems for many. The 2001 Tax Act, with its increasing credit shelter schedule, has prompted many attorneys to the use a ""disclaimer will"" as a mechanism by which to coordinate the credit shelter allowance and the unlimited marital deduction. While it can be costly to pursue multigenerational income tax advantages by making gifts, a parent or grandparent incurs no immediate cost when he or she names children or grandchildren as beneficiaries on his or her 401(k) or IRA account.","Kozol, George B, JD, LLM, CLU", Feature,May,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Marital deductions , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Life insurance , Tax exemptions , Income taxes , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Larger Estate Tax Exclusion Warrants a New Look at Planning Strategies,"Given the state of the economy, it is difficult to imagine public approval of a tax law that would abolish the estate tax for a year and reinstate the tax the next year at the lowest exemption level since 2002. Generally, a will or revocable trust that employs a nonmarital/marital trust arrangement automatically dictates that assets equal to the estate tax exclusion must first find the nonmarital trust with the balance passing to the marital trust. Now that the exclusion is $3.5 million, financial advisors may find that many estates may fund the nonmarital trust established for the benefit of the surviving spouse and the marital trust may not be funded at all. The increased estate tax exclusion offers a significant opportunity for many affluent married couples to position themselves to completely avoid federal estate taxation after both deaths.","Reardon, Dennis C, JD, LLM, CLU, ChFC", Feature,May,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Bills , Revocable trusts , Exclusion , Estate taxes , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

"The Role of ""Aging in Place"" in Financial Planning","Financial advisors primarily counsel middle-aged and older clients about their future financial life, because where they live and how they spend resources on their homes in older age is a critical piece of the planning jigsaw puzzle. However, advisors should include knowledge and understanding of aging in place as part of the financial gerontology toolkit. Overall, the current macroeconomic woes, personal and family finance, changes in pension programs, and the changing nature of work and retirement dynamics are all intersecting to change the way Americans evaluate the relationship between aging and housing. In the 21st century, the financial planning perspective is much broader than aging in place simply as an alternative to the nursing home; it is, rather, a middle-age planning challenge. Both demographics and polls argue that aging in place will be the primary residential style for the vast majority of tomorrow's elderly.

Desperately Seeking Distributions: Part II,"The second part of a series on plan distribution issues is presented. The economic crisis in the US has put many consumers in a difficult position with respect to retirement planning. Portfolios have shrunk, credit is tight, and home values are down, making fewer resources available. In a financial crisis, the easiest solution may seem to be an early IRA distribution. But the client may have circumstances that would allow a penalty-free early distribution from a qualified plan that is not permitted from an IRA. The 10% penalty on distributions prior to age 59 1/2 is set forth in IRC Section 72(t). It is subject to a wide range of exceptions based on clients' circumstances and methods or timing of payouts.

In Pursuit of the Good Life,"The down market has greatly damaged the financial plans of many Americans. Baby boomers who have been contributing to their 401(k) plans with a view toward early retirement are wondering if they will have to delay their retirement. The same down market has likewise tarnished, at least in the eyes of clients, the financial planning tactics that had worked well for many years. Estate planners are concerned that far fewer individuals still have net worths that may cause them concern about estate tax exposures. Most individuals believe, with good reason, that the housing market will reach a new equilibrium that will allow many to buy first homes, upsize, or downsize, as the case may be. This mindset means that the life insurance advisor will have to deal with stated or unstated objections related to long-term premium commitments and to modest long-term returns provided by policy cash values.","Kozol, George, JD, LLM, CLU", Feature,Mar,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Life insurance , Estate planning , Deferred compensation , Baby boomers , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Corruption can be viewed as a state of affairs that occurs when an individual, entity, or system does not perform as it was intended to perform, ie does not fulfill its purpose. Viewing corruption as what occurs when an activity or system goes counter to its proper aim or purpose, you can see that neither the lobbyists nor the government are carrying out their activities in the right way for the right reasons. In short, the pursuit of self-interest turned into selfishness, which is the unconstrained pursuit of self-interest at the expense of and without concern for others.

"The ""Combined Income"" Tax Effect on Early versus Normal Social Security Benefits for Single Individuals","People nearing retirement often ask if they should begin Social Security benefits early at age 62 or wait until normal retirement at age 66. Numerous studies examine this question, but recommendations conflict. Some recommend early commencement while others recommend waiting. Most studies exclude the impact of federal income taxes or simply assume a flat tax rate. This paper examines the effect of federal income taxes on the early versus normal commencement decision for single individuals, males and females separately. Analysis is based on present values adjusted for life expectancies. Results show that, in the absence of any special knowledge regarding one's life expectancy, males with low income should prefer early commencement. Males with modest income should be indifferent, and males with high income should wait until age 66. Females, regardless of income level, should defer until normal commencement at age 66. For individuals with modest to high income, the combined income tax effect shifts the commencement decision in favor of waiting.

At the time this was written, the recession was 11 months old and the economy was further contracting, and the net job loss was nearly 2 million.

With the election of Senator Obama to president and a Congress to be controlled by the Democratic Party for a minimum of two years, it is apparent that there will be significant federal estate taxes into the foreseeable future. The current law has a scheduled repeal of the federal estate ad generation-skipping transfer taxes for 2010. It appears safe to assume at this time that these taxes will be continued indefinitely.

The Unspoken Need for Life Insurance,"Death is certain to happen but uncertain as to when and how it will occur. Death is dreadful to contemplate so it is difficult to discuss. Indicatively, life insurance is not called death insurance, and it emphasizes the purchaser's peace of mind and lifetime benefits along with the financial security of survivors. This is understandable given society's death-denying culture, and it often facilitates life insurance purchases by those who need it. Investigation into bereavement and grief has increased rapidly over the past two decades. It appears most people cope with the distress of losing a loved one without suffering long-term or permanent, problematic health effects. Life insurance cannot prevent or end grieving. However, it can provide the time and resources to enable grieving people to focus on dealing with their loss by allowing for respites from work demands as well as relieving other distracting financial stresses until one is able to deal with them.","Lynch, J Timothy, JD, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Mar,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Death & dying , Research , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

EESA extends this ability to make these rollovers through Dec 31, 2009, which should encourage additional charitable giving.

Mental Health Parity: Moving Closer to an Effective National Policy,"Mental illness is the leading cause of disability in the US and Canada for individuals age 15-44, yet it often goes unrecognized as a public health matter. In the US, it is estimated that about 26.2% of adults, or 57.7 million people, are affected by mental illness each year. Citing concerns about the high costs of long-term and intensive therapy and extended hospital stays, private health insurance has historically placed more restrictions on treatment for mental illness compared to those for physical illnesses. The inequity in coverage between mental health and physical health care steadily increased during the 1990s. Mental health parity legislation is intended to eliminate the inequity between mental health and physical health coverage by addressing the problems of adverse selection and the unfairness associated with moral hazard.

In tough economic times, IRA owners and qualified plan participants facing a cash crunch may be forced to tap into retirement funds to meet emergency expenses or cover unmet needs such as college costs. Ideally, the client's liquid savings vehicles, portfolio investments, and even access to home equity would make it unnecessary to disturb tax-deferred retirement benefits.

While plan loans can be a tax-free solution for financially strapped participants, they are not for everyone.

The Value of Increasing Investment in Employee Benefits during an Economic Downturn,"Whether the US economy is in the middle of a recession, not in a recession, or on the verge of a recession is a subject of much debate. Businesses are cutting back and are reluctant to spend. According to a recent study by MarketingSherpa, 60% of large companies are cutting marketing budgets in 2008. A McGraw-Hill study conducted following the 1981-1982 recession showed that industrial companies that increased investment in marketing and advertising posted average revenue gains 40% greater than noninvestors during the period from 1980 to 1985. More impressive yet, investor companies saw 275% growth while firms that cut ad spending grew sales only 19% during the same period. Just as companies cut advertising budgets during a recession, they also tend to reduce employee benefits, or at least not add new ones.

Finding Happiness in Economic Hard Times: Is There a Silver Lining?,"As the news media remind people nearly every day, those nearing retirement and those who are already retired have lost a substantial portion of their assets over the past few months as a result of the economic downturn. And because they are older, with less time to recoup their losses, they are at greater risk than younger people. Following is some sound advice from the older people who participated in the study conducted by MetLife Mature Market Institute: 1. Start where you are. 2. Take responsibility. 3. Be positive. 4. Stay connected. 5. Give to others. 6. Keep growing and learning. 7. Be open and relax. Taking cues from the research and the philosophy that emerges, financial service professionals may be equipped to play a role in helping their clients look at the upside, making the most of what they have now as well as in the future.

Tax Implications and Responses for the Market Collapse,"In spite of all the arguments to the contrary, recent activity in the financial markets has shown that markets are not always rational in the short run. Arguing about the rationality of the market will not solve the problems facing clients who have been hurt by the falling prices and volatility. The focus of this article is to relate some tax tips to assist financial professionals in helping their clients deal with losses incurred in the recent market turmoil from declining values of both investment portfolios and real estate. The article will also discuss some attempts by the government to improve the situation in the financial markets. The idea of dollar-cost averaging is still valid. In the current political environment, clients with potential capital losses may also want to consider the effects of future tax rate changes on the relative benefit of current recognition of those losses versus deferring the recognition to a future period.","Biggart, Timothy B, PhD;Harden, J William, PhD, ChFC, CPA;Livingstone, Jane R, PhD, CPA", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial planning , Tax rates , Tax planning , Investment policy , Capital losses , Securities markets , Volatility , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
On Being a Leader,"It seems the long-stated adage that ""leaders are born, not made"" has a lot of merit. There is verifiable proof that many rise to the occasion to take the lead or step up when necessary but the innate and driving need of some to take on the role to always control or influence the group cannot be denied. Mostly, leaders are ""attractors,"" not ""promoters."" The best of them enjoy being with other leaders who enhance their value and challenge them to be even better. The obvious distinction of those who cannot feel comfortable around other leaders allows the true leaders to be even more recognizable. As new leaders begin to emerge in these times, the skills to engage and motivate are even more valuable than before. Many of the current leaders beginning to move into higher levels of authority are in fact late-stage Gen Xers or millennials themselves who also need the same things in those they lead.","Mazzei, Anthony T, Sr, CLU, ChFC, RFC, CLTC", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Motivation , Leadership , Managerial skills , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
"Estate Planning Challenge: Be Nimble, but Steady in Steering through the Storm","The financial events of the past several months have implications that may not be fully realized for years to come. Earlier in the decade, the tech bubble burst and Nasdaq stocks dropped at an alarming rate. Certain individual stocks outperformed the market, as is always the case. The failure of exotic financial instruments has created havoc in both credit markets and stock exchanges. When the financial contagion is brought back to concrete terms, it is difficult to identify a safe resting place among asset classes and equally difficult to make particular selections within an asset class. Lower interest rates, generally, can provide relief in many familiar estate and business planning situations. Following the death of an individual, determining the federal estate tax value of certain assets held by the estate has become a trickier proposition than it used to be. In today's market, many properties may not sell by the time the estate tax return would be filed.","Reardon, Dennis, JD, LLM, CLU, ChFC", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Stock exchanges , Return on investment , Fair market value , Investment policy , Estate taxes , Estate planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
New Proposed Regulations Impact Statutory Stock Options,"The Internal Revenue Code (Code) provides for two forms of so-called statutory stock options, i.e., forms of stock options to which Section 421 applies and whose requirements are addressed by specific Code provisions. These are incentive stock options described in Section 422, and stock options granted under an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) that is provided for in Section 423. Prior to 2006, Section 6039 required corporations to furnish a written statement to each employee regarding the corporation's transfer of its stock pursuant to the employee's exercise of an ISO and the transfer of its stock by the employee where the stock was acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option granted under an ESPP.

Estate Planning for the Middle Market,The middle market of estate planning involves clients who have significant estates but which are unlikely to be subject to estate taxes. These clients have sufficient assets to justify spending time and effort to ensure their estate planning goals are met without the concern of how federal estate taxes will impact what their beneficiaries receive. The number of clients in this situation is likely to increase with the increased estate tax exemption. This article explores the challenges that planning for these clients presents.

The Convergence Movement Six Years after Norwalk,"On Sep 18, 2002, the leadership of the American Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) formally agreed to work together to bring America's Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) toward compatibility with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The agreement was reached at the FASB's headquarters in Norwalk, CT, and was documented in a memorandum of understanding titled ""The Norwalk Agreement."" In the six years since the signing of the Norwalk Agreement, the FASB has issued or revised several Statements of Financial Accounting Standards to bring American GAAP into consistency with IFRS. Concerning revenue, in 2002 the FASB report stated that there is a voluminous body of detailed guidance that is difficult to retrieve.

Implications of the Financial Crisis on Retirement Savings and Planners,"What is most important for financial planners and most American workers is the reality of how little most are contributing to their 401(k)s, even with matches and base employer contributions, relative to what they would need to achieve ""adequacy."" Regardless of investment allocation and realistic rates of return, individuals will not achieve retirement savings adequacy unless they begin to contribute far more than they have in the past. Individuals need to insist that their planners live by the warnings in the fine print; past performance should not be relied upon as an indicator of the future. This financial crisis has underlined the need for more knowledge at the individual level, more risk assessment by planners, and the value to the individual of getting good comprehensive advice from a planner. This crisis can be turned into high value opportunity by all who become more sensitive to risk and focused on evaluation of alternative futures.","Salisbury, Dallas L", Feature,Jan,2009,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial planning , Retirement plans , Economic crisis , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

More Life Insurance Solutions,"Life insurance generates substantial amounts of tax-free money not otherwise available for a manageable outlay that is generally much less than the ultimate resources received. Life insurance-engendered dollars deal with, facilitate, or enhance myriad common and not so common situations. Life insurance provides the financial wherewithal to get through grief and move beyond loss. It provides the time and treatment to recover and move forward while preventing financial complications from making things more difficult. Life insurance, being money, can ease and further prenups. A surviving spouse can remain the beneficiary of his or her spouse's million-dollar 401k plan while the deceased plan participant's children can receive tax-free proceeds from a life insurance policy purchased to replace the plan benefits. Life insurance's leverage cost can come from the couple's combined or separate incomes depending on the facts and intended beneficiaries.

This study shows that these types of financial advisor observations and perceptions are accurate, and that individual differences on these three dimensions differ significantly based on a person's financial risk tolerance. Findings suggest that individuals who exhibit the lowest level of financial risk tolerance tend to (a) be the least competent in terms of financial matters, (b) have the lowest subjective evaluations of net worth, and (c) experience the least satisfaction with their financial management skills. The questions used in the study might be appropriate for inclusion in advisory data-gathering tools as a way to help differentiate individuals into categories of potential recommendation implementation.

"Value, Growth, and Style Rotation Strategies in the Long Run","Much research has been devoted to the risk and return attributes of a stock versus a bond portfolio over time. However, relatively little research has been focused on the long-term risk-and-return characteristics of a value versus a growth investment strategy With the increasing popularity of these well-known investment styles, particularly when it is applied to a self-directed retirement account, there is a need to educate investors about the risk-and-return characteristics of a value versus growth style over different time horizons. This study, therefore, seeks to fill that information gap. We investigate the performance of value, growth, and style rotation strategies across different time horizons using value-at risk and conditional tail expectation. Our empirical results show that value stocks exhibit greater risks and higher returns than growth stocks in the short run. However, value stocks will outperform growth stocks in terms of both risk and return in the long run. The superiority of value stocks over time still exists even under the assumption that stock returns are non-mean-reverting. The performance of a simple style-rotation strategy is also evaluated. The empirical results show that a rotation strategy can improve long-run risks but that it will not deliver adequate returns as compared to either a value or a growth-only portfolio. Our results are based on observed capital markets history and empirical resampling procedures and can be used to help individual investors determine the best-suited investment styles given their own unique investment horizons.

Executive agencies will be issuing regulations over the next two years with the expectation that the CLASS program will be up and running by 2013. There is little detail at present regarding many aspects of the CLASS program, but the key features as prescribed by the new law raise questions about its sustainability (without taxpayer subsidy), its relationship to the private market for long-term care insurance, and the effect that it will have on the financial planning process.

Retirement Planning in Light of Life Expectancy and Gender Issues,"The popular press, government publications, and researchers in various fields have long made the assertion that women are less well-off in retirement than are men. Many reasons are given for this inequity, including longer life expectancy for women. Beginning in 1986, with the adoption of unisex tables for determining distributions from qualified retirement plans, Congress has made several attempts to mitigate the disparity caused by differing life expectancies between men and women. This research investigates whether or not the difference in life expectancies between men and women causes a significant difference in the distributions from retirement plans, examines the policies implemented by Congress, and suggests financial planning considerations for men and women. Preliminary results suggest that, under certain circumstances, the difference in life expectancy does cause a significant difference in the distributions.

Advisors who recognize the planning issues and pitfalls can help their clients make a real difference with their retirement assets. Life insurance can help facilitate these strategies.

A Fundamental Shift to Fundamental Indexing,"A new approach to constructing index funds is gaining increasing prominence in the never-ending debate over active versus passive equity management. As total assets invested in fundamental index mutual funds approach $8 billion, personal financial planners and private wealth managers can expect to receive more inquiries from their clients about this relatively new phenomenon. In contrast to conventional index funds, fundamental index funds weight the percentage allocation of each stock in the index based on ""fundamental"" factors, such as total dollars of earnings or dividends paid, rather than simply market capitalization. Whether or not fundamental indexing is a revolution in theory, the intuitively appealing logic in favor of fundamental indexing and the excellent performance of fundamental index funds to date should command the attention of individual investors and their advisors. Since the first FTSE RAFI 1000 Fundamental Index Fund was launched in December of 2005, FTSE RAFI and Wisdom Tree fundamental index funds have attracted more than $7.5 billion of investments in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) dedicated to the fundamental index strategy. On the institutional side, institutional investors have more than $22 billion invested that follow the Research Affiliates' fundamental index models. The extraordinary success of this new investment concept most likely flows from the fact that fundamental indexing makes a lot of intuitive sense as an opportunity for risk reduction and return enhancement. Fundamental indexing is likely to prove to be a viable investment option for many years to come.

Reaching a Retirement Wealth Target: A New Life-Cycle Asset Allocation Strategy,"In this paper, simulations are performed to generate retirement wealth target probability distributions under several preretirement savings and asset allocation strategies that can be implemented by investors. Results show that initial savings rates necessary to achieve the retirement wealth targets studied can be reduced by combining a typical life-cycle asset allocation with a strategy of switching to T-bills when retirement wealth targets are reached. In light of the recent large decline in stock prices, many investors near retirement may have been better off with a strategy of switching to risk-free assets.

What has changed more dramatically is the public's perception of the risk inherent in investing. Both risk tolerance and risk perception influence investing behavior.

Recent Trends in 401(k) Participants' Asset Allocations,"For many U.S. households, retirement saving is their most important savings goal. Over the past two decades, 401(k) plans have risen in importance in U.S. households' retirement saving. Households' management of those assets will have an impact on their accumulations at retirement. This article analyzes the asset allocation of 401(k) participants' account balances. Over the past decade, there has been a trend toward increasing diversification of investments among 401(k) plan participants. On average, at year-end 2008, 56% of 401(k) participants' assets were invested in equity securities through equity funds, the equity portion of balanced funds (including lifecycle/target date funds), and company stock. Forty-one percent of 401(k) participants' assets were invested in fixed-income securities such as stable value investments and bond and money market funds. Three-quarters of 401(k) plans included lifecycle funds in their investment lineup at year-end 2008. Also known as ""target date"" funds, they are designed to simplify investing and automate account rebalancing. New employees continued to use balanced funds, including lifecycle funds. In addition, the share of 401(k) accounts invested in company stock continued to shrink. Recently hired 401(k) participants contributed to this trend as well; they were less likely to hold employer stock.

Behavioral Perspectives on Index Funds,"The article identifies a number of behavioral advantages of index funds when compared with actively managed funds. Index funds have advantages with respect to the perception of loss, realism of expectations, appropriateness of choice criteria, net dividend income, and the emotional attachment to investments.

Concepts used include loss aversion, disappointment aversion, regret aversion, overconfidence, hindsight bias, illusion of control, illusion of knowledge, representativeness, availability, familiarity bias, default option bias, mental accounting, and the status quo bias.

Trust Ownership of Nonqualified Annuities: General Considerations for Trustees,"Trustees have shown an increasing interest in annuities during the last 10 years largely because of the benefit guarantees offered by new types of annuity riders. However, annuities and trusts are complex instruments, and a combination of the two may present unique tax, financial, and legal issues. The Internal Revenue Code Section 72 rules on nonnatural persons, taxable distributions, penalty taxes, and death distributions for annuities must be considered. The taxation rules for grantor, simple, and complex trusts should also be reviewed. The trustee must be certain that an annuity purchase does not impinge on a beneficiary's rights and is consistent with the risk profile of the trust. State trust law may also impact the decision of an annuity purchase.

The Origin and History of the ESOP and Its Future Role as a Business Succession Tool,"The first ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) came into being in 1956.

Along the spectrum of these roles, fiduciary liability, fulfillment of the settlor's intentions, apportionment of trust responsibilities, and tax consequences could vary significantly.

The importance of both psychological and economic factors to financial well-being is discussed. This article analyzes the patterns in financial well-being across age, gender, and income groups in a group of clients of financial advisors. We employ a novel measure of financial well-being--the subjective assessment of financial security and stability. The pattern across ages and income groups differs between men and women. Financial well-being improves across age groups, independent of income. It is also significantly associated with income and wealth. This study provides specific recommendations for how patterns in financial well-being can be deployed to frame financial advice.

The Relationship between Postemployment Covenants and Postemployment Benefits,"The competitive advantage of firms is increasingly dependent on the economic linkage of product markets and labor markets. Human capital and information are the conduits of this market linkage. The mobility of these resources among firms has given rise to related contractual institutions. This article explores a subset of those contracts--postemployment covenants, as linked to postemployment benefits. To lend concreteness to the area of inquiry, exemplary cases and empirical evidence are presented. However, the primary purpose is outlining a conceptual framework that recognizes the particular and peculiar category of postemployment, preretirement status. This adds insight into how benefits can be used to balance financial risk to the employee from termination and financial risk to the employer from competitive threats derived from employee mobility.

Should Prospective Retirees Forgo Tax-Deductible Contributions to Retirement Plans to Reduce Required Minimum Distribution Payments?,"Given the enormous size of projected federal budget deficits, it is likely that federal income tax rates will rise, and perhaps dramatically so, over the next several years in order to reduce or at least slow down the growth rate in U.S. debt. Many taxpayers may consequently find themselves paying a higher rate of tax on required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their tax-deferred retirement accounts (e.g., IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s) relative to the rate of tax savings generated when contributions were made to the accounts. This article addresses RMD payments in general and when, if ever, a prospective retiree should forgo tax deductible contributions to retirement plans in favor of placing after-tax savings in taxable accounts in order to reduce RMD payments and related tax liabilities. Effective tax rate comparisons are made under various rate-of-return and marginal tax rate scenarios.

We consider potential legal liability associated with the term ""comprehensive,"" recognizing that clients may interpret it differently. To assess the profession's allegiance to the term, we conducted, and report the findings of, a survey of members of the Financial Planning Association. Although some planners express concerns about legal liability exposure that comes from use of the term ""comprehensive,"" the overall evidence is inconclusive. To mitigate these liability concerns, we consider the current standards set forth by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards as they relate to engagement letters, and provide a list of recommendations for improving engagement letters.

Does Revenue Ruling 2009-13 Sound the Death Knell for Life Settlements?,"There are a multitude of reasons why a family may no longer need an existing life insurance policy to meet their estate planning goals.

The Power-Influence Dynamics in a Consultant/Client Relationship,"In today's information-rich world, consultants face many challenges for the attention of clients. The plethora of Web sites offering robust, and more importantly, free advice, as well as increased competition for clients and prospects, makes it ever harder to develop and maintain client relationships. However, understanding the power-influence dynamic can help solidify the critical role consultants serve in the client's financial life. With a basic understanding of the theory behind the interpersonal dynamics of power and influence, financial service professionals can begin to develop approaches to be more influential professionals.

Whom Do You Trust? Six Nontax Factors to Consider When Selecting a Trustee,"When it comes to estate planning, trusts invariably are part of the structure. Without a doubt, your clients will be doing some planning that will include trusts, and with trusts, the rubber hits the road (and sometimes the ship runs aground) in the form of trustee selection. Most articles on trustee selection focus on the imbedded tax issues, leaving nontax or ""soft"" issues unaddressed.

Findings indicate that when asset classes begin to exhibit high correlations and volatility rises significantly, the portfolio containing the collar as a substitute for debt outperforms the traditional debt/equity mix.

Investor Prudence and the Role of Financial Advice,"Investors have difficulties making optimal long-term financial decisions for reasons such as shortsightedness, a lack of financial sophistication, and an inability to self-regulate. Using propriety data collected during the 2007 recession, a period where investors lost over $8 billion by making impulse investment decisions, this study examines the impact of professional financial advice on an investor's commitment to long-term financial goals. Results suggest that investors who use a financial advisor are about one-and-a-half times more likely to adhere to long-term investment decisions.

The Relationship between Money Market Mutual Fund Maturity and Interest Rates,"This study examines the causal relationship between the average maturity of taxable money market mutual funds (MMMF) and short-term interest rates. The credit and financial crises of 2007-2008 have led to significant changes in the functioning of the short-term credit market. Motivated by these transformations, we also investigate the underlying relationship to find out if a change in the ability of MMMF managers to anticipate and/or react to fluctuations in interest rates has occurred in the postcrisis period. We use the Granger-causality test to examine this relationship. Our findings suggest that the average maturity of MMMF cannot be used to predict changes in T-bill yield. On the contrary, we find that MMMF managers adjust the maturities of their portfolios in response to changes in T-bill yields. Our results also show that MMMF managers appeared to anticipate changes in commercial paper (CP) rates from two to eight weeks in advance in periods prior to the financial crisis (January 3, 1995 to December 26, 2006). We did not find similar evidence in the succeeding periods (2007-2010). This result questions the efficiency of the CP market. Given our findings, we recommend that financial planners should scrutinize the portfolio composition and noninvestment-related features of a fund before recommending it to their clients. If a significant proportion of a fund's portfolio consists of assets, which its portfolio manager possesses no superior ability to select, then recommendations concerning the fund should be based on expense ratios and other convenience features that are directly related to the unique needs of the client.

Completing Charitable Remainder Trust Reviews: An Advisor's Guide,"Ever since the charitable remainder trust (CAT) was introduced to the Tax Code in 1969, most advisors have considered CATs to be ""buy-it-and-forget-it"" vehicles, and for good reason. Until the last few years, there were few or no alternatives for clients once they had funded their CATS. Now that there are alternatives, it makes sense to do what advisors always do: continuously review their clients' situations, the markets, and ""other factors,"" as recommended by the North American Securities Administrators Association. This article walks you through a procedure you can use to determine if your client's CAT is still the best vehicle to meet the client's objectives. If you determine that the CAT is no longer meeting these goals, you may want to consider discussing alternatives that may be more advantageous.

The Value of Financial Advisors to Retirees,"This study explores the value of financial advisors to retirees, in terms of both the likelihood of the retiree to undertake planning activities and his/her feelings of confidence and financial security. Results indicate retirees with financial advisors are more confident their assets will cover retirement expenses, more confident their assets are being managed in the best way possible, and feel more financially secure. Additionally, retirees with financial advisors were more likely to undertake all planning activities compared to those without an advisor, and were more likely to have thought about certain important issues.

Examining the Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax,"A new type of tax, named the ""Unearned Income Medicare Contribution,"" was enacted in 2010 as part of health care reform legislation. It is an additional income tax on the unearned income of certain taxpayers. This tax is different because it is essentially an extension of the Hospital Insurance tax, which is a component of existing FICA and SECA taxes on earned income. FICA and SECA taxes apply only to earned income, but the Medicare Contribution tax will apply only to unearned income. Although it is not scheduled to begin until 2013, taxpayers and advisors should have an understanding of its impending consequences before it actually goes into effect.

An Analysis of the Contribute-and-Convert Technique for IRA Contributions,"Congress's repeal of the $100,000 adjusted gross income limitation for Roth IRA conversions allows taxpayers, regardless of income, to contribute indirectly to a Roth IRA by contributing to a traditional IRA and converting the contributed amount to a Roth IRA. This article presents a framework for analyzing whether this contribute-and-convert technique is better than a direct Roth IRA or traditional IRA contribution. The results show that the technique generally is a beneficial strategy for liquidity-constrained taxpayers who can deduct their traditional IRA contributions and taxpayers who are ineligible to contribute directly to Roth IRAs.

Financial advisors appropriately focus on numerical projections of client resources and needs over the next number of years. But the mental metrics many clients use to evaluate future resources versus expenditures are rooted in their past personal experience. Even if they have sufficient resources to pay current bills, financial nostalgia from teenage years starkly reminds them that things will cost more in the future. They may not worry about today's cost, but these mental metrics emphasize that most important costs will rise. And for that, often independent of their income, their worries are real.

The 401(k) rules appear to be the most rigid. For nonqualified plans, on the surface the rules seem somewhat similar. However, with the ""similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the service provider"" provision existing in the nonqualified plan area, coupled with the IRS's liberal interpretation of the provision in Revenue Ruling 2010-27, the nonqualified area for hardship distributions seems to be wide and flexible, particularly when compared with the 401(k) rules.

A Comparison of Financial Analysis Software for Use in Financial Planning for Small Businesses,"While there is a plethora of tools, methods, and alternatives for financial planning for individuals, there is a minimal variety of tools or methods available to help small business owners with their planning. Of course there is abundant information that relates to successor planning, but there is virtually nothing designed to help small business owners evaluate the efficiency of their businesses or seek areas for improvement to help in the evaluation process for loans, sale, or perpetuation. Separating small business owners from their business is nearly impossible, so planners should offer assistance in valuation and improving the salability or financial position when the owner seeks to either borrow funds to expand or sell the business. To that end, the authors have reviewed a variety of software packages designed to help evaluate and improve the ratios and efficiency of small businesses for both the valuation for sale and funding of succession planning by a comparison of the ratios addressed by lending institutions as measures of efficiency and return.

Partial Roth Conversions in Early Retirement: An Effective Strategy for Extending Portfolio Longevity,"Roth conversions are beneficial to middle-class Americans with substantial tax-deferred accounts and modest taxable incomes. Those approaching retirement or in retirement perhaps best fit this description. A conversion strategy not only extends the life of a portfolio, it also protects against substantial future tax expenditures through the transfer of funds to a tax-free Roth IRA account in early retirement. The analysis conducted demonstrates that a dual-earning couple with combined annual income of $200,000 would be astute to fund a traditional 401(k) over a Roth 401(k) and then, at retirement, initiate partial Roth conversions.

"Should Retirees Play the Social Security Lottery? An Analysis of the ""Reset"" Strategy","This paper analyzes the recently discovered reset strategy that allows retirees to repay the SSA all benefits received and, having done so, to reapply for benefits at a higher level. This strategy is relevant to retirees who claimed retirement benefits early and later realized that they could have received higher benefits had they delayed claiming. Many articles in the printed media and in financial blogs recommend the reset strategy enthusiastically. None of the published articles consider the consequences of the reset strategy for risk-averse retirees who wish to leave bequests. This paper shows that the reset strategy is a risky bet with high probability of ruin and, therefore, represents an unattractive investment for risk-averse retirees. However, for another class of retirees--those who do not wish to leave bequests and are concerned only with their own consumption level during their lifetimes--the reset strategy represents an opportunity to buy an annuity at a very attractive price.

The analysis demonstrates that traditional SWPs are unsafe at any practical speed and expose retirees to unacceptable depletion risk. In addition, there is also a significant risk that such programs will fall to preserve a reasonable legacy for heirs. The paper suggests alternative solutions that address these shortcomings.

The Influence of Financial Sophistication and Financial Planners on Roth IRA Ownership,"Using the Survey of Consumer Finances, this paper studies the influence of financial sophistication and financial planners on the likelihood of owning a Roth IRA. Both descriptive and regression analysis confirm the hypothesis that households with greater access to financial sophistication, either through someone within the household or through a financial planner, are more likely to hold a Roth IRA. Households with financial sophistication are more likely to take advantage of Roth IRAs when the benefits are the greatest, i.e., when they are young or during lower tax rate periods. Results from this paper highlight the key role and value financial planners can play in helping households make complicated financial decisions.

Should I Stay or Should I Go? Deciding What to Do with Money in a Former Employer's Retirement Plan,"One of the toughest decisions a client who participates in an employer-sponsored retirement plan faces is what to do with the balance in the retirement plan once he or she is no longer employed by the plan sponsor. The client may view the money as a newly discovered resource available to be used any way the client wants. Doing so can result in significant income tax consequences (possibly including a 10% penalty) for the client. In addition, it can significantly impact a client's retirement resources. Numerous factors should be considered in evaluating the client's options. Those factors are explored in this column, along with how the author evaluated them when faced with exactly this situation.

Useful Financial Planning Concepts from Academic Research,"Academic research is sometimes obtuse or inapplicable to the real world of financial services. Further, because of the nature of the primary market for academic journals, even relevant and helpful articles are inaccessible to most financial service professionals.

The topics include investment planning, retirement planning, and estate planning, all of which are part of the Certified Financial Planner topic list.

Alternatives to Long-Term Care Insurance,"The cost of long-term care for America's senior citizens continues to increase and, along with it, the need to determine a satisfactory method of paying for these expenses. This paper examines first, the need for long-term care, and then traditional and nontraditional planning mechanisms to meet this need. It begins first with a review of traditional long-term care insurance and then moves on to viable alternatives to such insurance, including the use of life insurance or annuity-based products, reverse mortgages, self-insurance, and Medicaid planning. Whereas the Medicaid alternative continues to be a controversial, and even ethical, issue, the paper concludes with the statement that the Medicaid alternative is a primary funding mechanism for a majority of American families today who have failed to plan properly. This is not expected to change in the future as the difficulty in qualifying for traditional long-term care insurance policy coverage increases, with the number of companies offering such coverage continuing to decline.

The Affordable Care Act after the Supreme Court Decision,"The Supreme Court decision reinforced some of the goals of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). By upholding the individual mandate, the court secured one of the key provisions of the ACA that is intended to reduce the number of uninsured Americans. However, the decision about the Medicaid expansion will likely reduce the number of currently uninsured individuals who would have been covered in the future. The decision about the Medicaid expansion also reduces the number of newly insured patients who will have coverage for their care in hospitals and for their prescription medications.

In the baseline, workers save for 30 years to replace 50% of their preretirement net income with subsequent inflation adjustments over a 30-year retirement. Public pension benefits would be added to this. The worst-case scenario saving rates ranged across the countries from 16.3% to 74.3%.

Beneficiary Defective Trusts: The Better Insurance Trust?,"The beneficiary defective trust (BDT) is a trust typically established by a parent for the benefit of a child. The child is usually treated as the owner of the trust under Sec. 678 of the Internal Revenue Code, but the trust is not includible in the taxable estate of the child. The BDT can be used to own business investments that the child might otherwise own personally. If the BDT is structured properly, the business interests it owns will not be included in the taxable estate of the child, but the child will nonetheless, as a beneficiary of the BDT, enjoy the income and other economic benefits of the business interest. The BDT can also own life insurance on the life of the child. When so used, the BDT, especially one funded with income-producing assets, can avoid some of the disadvantages associated with the typical irrevocable life insurance trust. These disadvantages include the need to use Crummey withdrawal powers to shield insurance premium payments from gift tax.

The Imperfect Match between Long-Term Care Risk and Long-Term Care Insurance,"Long-term care insurance (LTCI) has low acceptance by consumers due to cost, failure by consumers to face this risk, and deficiencies in the product. Part of the problem is that insureds want coverage against their long-term care expenses, but must bear the risks of predicting the number of years of long-term care coverage needs and future costs of long-term care itself, as well as rising premiums to keep the policy in force at the coverage level sought. This means a good share of the future long-term care risk is still borne by the insured, even after buying LTCI. Unlike property and liability, disability, and life insurance, where some portion of the pool incurs a loss in the current year, LTCI creates a pool where the losses shift to, and increase in, future years. This presents an imperfect match between risk shifting and risk financing. Hybrid products that combine long-term care benefits with annuities or universal life insurance in a well-integrated format may be more attractive combinations than stand-alone LTCI to meet the multiple finance and estate needs, income constraints, and risk allocations of many consumers.

Life insurance money also is an effective way to address emerging social and economic realities. It protects financially dependent persons of all ages. It funds educational opportunities and other competitive advantages. Life insurance cash sustains family caregivers. It facilitates long-term care and eases end-of-life experiences.

Numerous personal and financial factors should be examined and consideration should be given to maintaining the highest possible standard of living and quality of life during the retirement years as a result of the decision. While numerous factors should be considered by each individual prior to making the decision to retire, the analysis in this article indicates that postponing Social Security retirement beyond age 62 to age 66 or to age 70 produces higher returns on the Social Security taxes paid during an individual's working years based upon expected future benefits and life expectancy. However, starting benefits at age 62, if financially feasible in the individual's overall retirement plan, is the best course of action based upon the negative or very low rates of return received by retirees when delaying Social Security retirement benefits beyond age 62.

Disability Buyout Considerations,"Buy-sell agreements typically address measures to be followed if a business owner dies, as well as a host of possible lifetime ""triggering events"" that may lead to a sale of the owner's business interest. Not enough attention is typically paid to the prospect that an owner may become disabled. A proper buy-sell agreement should consider the following: (1) disability buyout versus disability income, (2) the definition of disability, and (3) valuation -- not just how much, but when. Alternatively, clients should consider disability buyout insurance.

Assessing Client Stress and Why It Matters to Financial Advisors,This paper describes why it is important for financial service advisors to understand how client stress impacts the client-financial advisor relationship. A key finding is that few clients are able to accurately evaluate their level of financial stress.

This means that only about 20% of prospective clients are cognitively receptive to receiving and implementing financial recommendations.

However, many clients are reluctant to do more legal work than they perceive is absolutely necessary, even though a review of all aspects of one's estate plan in the event of divorce is not just a good idea, it is an imperative.

The Senior Citizen Marriage Tax Penalty/Bonus,"Differences in federal income tax burdens between married and unmarried couples are insignificant in most cases; however, as unmarried senior couples' incomes diverge from a 50/50 split, increases in income significantly increase their tax burdens. When incomes include Social Security benefits and are close to a 50/50 split, the unmarried couples' tax burden is significantly lower at moderate to higher income levels than that of married couples. These differences in tax burdens could have a significant impact on the marriage/divorce decision. The tables in this article show tax differences between married and unmarried couples' tax burdens at various levels of income, Social Security benefits, and income splits. Although retirement planners will not usually deal with marriage/divorce advice, they should be aware of the potential tax traps or benefits to their senior citizen clients who are considering either.

The Role of Long-Term Care in Planning for Retirement,"Advisors need to alter the perspective that many clients may be able to ""self-insure"" if they have accumulated some magical dollar amount of assets. The focus should shift to income requirements, not assets, to meet long-term care costs. If a portfolio is designed to generate a retirement income goal without regard to a potential extended care event requiring additional income, it will fail to perform successfully.

Advisor-Boomer Client Relationships: Raising Financial Literacy and Retirement Well-Being,"Evidence has been accumulating across the behavioral sciences that good financial decision making involves both cognitive and emotional effort. Although financial professionals know this intuitively, most have yet to master the art and science of educating midlife and older clients to navigate the complex cultural influences and decision dynamics that exist for everyone. As baby boomers swell the numbers of preretirees and the already retired, successful financial professionals increasingly will become the ""go to"" educators who help midlife and older clients (and also members of their communities) make the knowledgeable and deliberative financial decisions that can improve their retirement well-being. A framework is presented that illustrates and explains the social influences and psychological dynamics of consumer financial decision making.

Understanding the Impact of the Digital Age on Estate Settlement,"The Internet has profoundly impacted the way clients and planners think about and prepare for retirement. As baby boomers seriously think about their own deaths, it is apparent that the digital wave is having a profound impact on how estates are settled. Our lives can be accessed via digital devices but clients know very little about how this process works, and our elected officials -- both nationally and on a state level -- have done little to update the legal systems to accommodate this cultural change.

"""Suitability"" in the Sale of Fixed Insurance Products: A Look at Some of the Murkier Issues","The question of ""suitability,"" as it relates to recommendations about insurance or investment products, has always been a difficult one. There are two ""standards of care:"" the suitability standard and the fiduciary standard. The former always applies to any insurance agent or financial advisor, and, depending upon the advisor's licensure, credentials, and behavior, the latter may also apply. One of the most troublesome and unclear issues is whether an insurance agent not registered to sell securities or provide investment advice may sell a fixed insurance product if the product recommended will be purchased with dollars taken from a securities account. This article examines existing regulations and some state regulatory actions dealing with that issue, and one state regulatory bulletin that offers useful guidelines for agents.

The Role of Insurance in Retirement Planning,"Many things can prevent a retirement plan from working as planned. Part of the planning process should include an assessment of the risks the plan and client face and how to help protect the plan against those risks. Insurance is available to help minimize the impact of some risks. Health insurance, disability income insurance, long-term care insurance, life insurance, and property and casualty insurance should all be considered in a client's retirement planning.

The Capital Gains Timing Decision,"Prior to expiration of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, investors were faced with an important tax-timing decision. Should they realize current long-term capital gains at the existing 15% rate, or defer the realization of capital gains to a later tax year, but at a likely higher tax rate? Although advice on this topic was widely available in the financial media, there was little consensus as to the optimal tax-timing decision and few details were given in support of most recommendations. Given that investors are faced with a variety of similar capital gains timing choices, this paper develops a quantitative model that defines the relevant issues and assists the investor in making optimal tax-timing decisions.

Deferred Income Annuities: Reducing Longevity Risk in Retirement Planning,"Longevity is one of the greatest risks in retirement income planning, and one of the hardest risks to address. Individuals are living longer, which means building a retirement plan based on an arbitrary end date gathered from life expectancy tables is not sufficient planning to address this risk. Saving enough capital and withdrawing a certain percent every year is not an effective plan for retirement income either. Without a guaranteed income stream, individuals will be left open to the risk of outliving their assets. The purpose of this paper is to propose the use of a deferred income annuity as a potential solution to hedge against this risk. A case study is used to illustrate how a financial advisor can use a deferred income annuity to provide his or her client with a product that offers a potential solution to the longevity risk problem.

"Taxes ""Jump"" for Trusts-Is Distributing the Answer?","The income tax burden on trusts has risen substantially. However, there is a strong argument against just blindly distributing income outright to beneficiaries. It may save some tax, yet possibly squander the assets or defeat the overarching purpose of the trust. Clear examples include when the assets are generation-skipping tax exempt, when the beneficiary is a spendthrift or has asset protection issues, and when the assets would serve to increase the beneficiary's taxable estate. Without a doubt, a fiduciary must consider the impact of taxes on the trust, but also must consider all relevant factors in determining the prudent course of action.

Managing Health Care Costs with Health Reimbursement Arrangements and Health Savings Accounts,"Generous insurance benefits with low deductibles and out-of-pocket limits have created a situation in which the health care consumer often has little ""skin in the game"" and therefore ignores the cost of care, which drives up health care costs. Account-based plans, such as Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), are parts of what is often referred to as consumer-driven health plans (CDHPs). One of the goals of CDHPs is to make patients more aware of the actual costs of medical services and therefore become good consumers. HRAs and HSAs can be effective tools to help convert plan participants into good consumers of health care. The rules associated with HRAs and HSAs are complex and care needs to be taken in implementing these account-based plans.

The Managerial Power Theory of Executive Compensation,"As a consequence of the disconnect between executive compensation and the financial meltdown that battered the economy as a whole, the academic community is developing a new theory of executive compensation, which is referred to as the managerial power theory of executive compensation. The proponents of this theory argue that the current system of corporate governance unavoidably creates incentives and psychological and social forces that distort executive compensation. These proponents make several recommendations to provide executives with well designed and cost-effective compensation programs that will generate shareholder value. Planners should be knowledgeable about these coming changes because they could very well be considered ""best practices"" in the near future, and as such could establish the standard by which the executive compensation programs for nonpublicly held companies will be measured.

State Health Insurance Exchanges,"Although many people view the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) as a radical change in the way we finance health care in the U.S., in fact it is a continuation of the multifaceted system we've had for some time. The ACA includes a mix of public and private financing, with most Americans receiving insurance through their places of employment, while others will purchase private insurance as individuals. Some of these employers and individuals will purchase insurance through health exchanges. The ACA also retains roles for both state and federal governments. States will continue to participate in the Medicaid program, some with expanded eligibility. And most states will either develop state-run exchanges or partner with the federal government to do so. The health insurance exchange concept is a crucial component of the new multifaceted approach to financing health care.

Tax Haven versus Safe Haven: Where Is the U.S. Taxpayer/Investor to Go?,"Traditionally, investors would select a particular tax haven for purposes such as low taxation; however, a host of other factors may prove far more essential: confidentiality, banking, currency control, communications, and treaty networks. Before selecting a particular tax haven, taxpayers and investors need to cautiously examine the economic and political stability of the nation, its geographic accessibility to worldwide markets, the availability of labor, the risk of nationalization of assets, and government cooperation. Planners need to keep in mind that the privacy and confidentiality once promised with these planning tools have eroded. Despite these shortcomings with offshore businesses and investing, the need for international tax planning has not diminished.

Electronic Participant Fee Disclosures: A Review of Electronic Disclosures as a Cost-Efficient Delivery Alternative,"In an effort to improve the transparency of fees and expenses associated with retirement plans, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has increased fee disclosure regulations during the past year. While this goal is a noble one, it ignores the significant costs of distribution, which are often passed on to participants. Electronic delivery could significantly reduce such costs, but the DOL's current interim requirements for electronic delivery are extremely burdensome, with the greatest barrier being the default opt-in rule. This article discusses strategies for satisfying the current requirements, while arguing that the DOL should adopt a default opt-out rule when implementing its final rule on electronic delivery. Beyond cost savings, electronic disclosures provide many benefits that increase access to and improve participants' understanding of the disclosures. This article discusses those benefits and argues that electronic disclosures may better serve the DOL's goal of greater transparency. The focus is on electronic 404a-5 disclosures, but many of these requirements and benefits are applicable to other disclosures, as well.

Advising Couples: More Art Than Science,"Due to the rise in women's economic power and their increasingly present roles in managing family finances and in vestments, a successful couples advisor needs to learn how to balance the needs of both members of a couple. This requires a different skill set and knowledge base than working with an individual client, or catering to only one member of the partnership. To effectively counsel couples, an advisor needs a solid understanding of couple dynamics and key gender differences relative to communication, interpersonal preferences, and wealth. The professional needs to be part mediator, part facilitator, and part objective observer--making advising couples more an than science. To date, there is very little written for financial service professionals on how to effectively advise couples. This is surprising given the reality that most of the clients seen by financial advisors and planners are couples. This article discusses how couple dynamics play out in advising meetings and offers five strategies for maximizing the advisor's effectiveness in working with couples.

Will Baby Boomers Phase into Retirement?,"Baby boomers have modified every institution they have touched and changed the landscapes of education, housing, investing, and many social establishments. Why would retirement be any different? After all, employees face a well documented shortfall of the funds needed for retirement. Employers are confronted with a brain drain and the loss of skilled labor when the boomer cohort adds candles to its annual cake. There is a need for adaptive retirement strategies--on the parts of both employees and employers. There is no longer one standard retirement approach, and given the ever-changing employment environment, it is crucial for both employees and employers to stay innovative when it comes to retirement solutions. One such innovation is phased retirement. Phased retirement can be thought of as a broad variety of employment arrangements allowing retirees to continue working at reduced workloads while gradually shifting from full-time work to full-time retirement. This article looks at the characteristics of phased retirement, different approaches to phased retirement, and why it can be beneficial for both employees and employers, as well as the challenges phased retirement presents. It is concluded that the baby boom generation will make retirement phasing the next step in its game-changing march through time.

The Alternative Minimum Tax and Its Impact on the Middle Class-Part 1,"The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was originally designed to combat aggressive tax planning used to eliminate or substantially eliminate the taxable income of high-income taxpayers. In 2012 the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT is expected to explode by 661%, from 4.1 million in 2010 to 31.2 million. The AMT is no longer a tax imposed only on high-income individuals; it has descended to the ranks of middle-income taxpayers.

Debt Begets Debt: Examining Negative Credit Card Behaviors and Other Forms of Consumer Debt,"The effect of negative credit card behaviors is examined for association with other forms of consumer debt (automobile debt, installment debt, and personal loan debt). Data were collected using a combination of random digit dialing and convenience sampling from two cities. Respondents' median age is 48 years old, ranging from 20-87. Results indicate that despite controlling for income, not paying off the monthly balance and reaching the maximum limit on credit cards are associated with a variety of other debts. Although consumers can increase lifetime utility by borrowing, less educated consumers are more vulnerable to less favorable sources of credit. Negative credit card behaviors can be easily identifiable signals of larger lurking issues related to consumer behavior or lack of financial literacy. Controlling for income, younger adults accrue significantly more installment debt, possibly suggesting that younger generations perceive a larger number of required appliances and electronics as being necessary to run the household than previous generations.

Repercussions of a Sustained Low-Interest-Rate Environment on Life Insurance Products,"Interest rates have a direct and an indirect impact on life insurance companies, their new product offerings, and existing policies. Interest rates have been declining for decades, and there is little expectation of a short-term turnaround. The yield erosion has impacted all permanent life insurance policies due to the inherent reliance of earnings in the products and is also shaping new products available for sale. The article explores how the declining yields manifest differently across product types and premium funding patterns. In addition, the article explores how carrier investment portfolio structures and spread compression may delay or mute reflection in policies of a rising interest rate environment. Products are too complex for the layperson to self-manage. It is critical for life insurance professionals to make clients aware of the impact of the rate environment on their life insurance policies, help them set reasonable expectations going forward, and guide them in developing appropriate courses of action for their unique situations.

Why Tax Minimization Is Overrated in Estate Planning,"Advisors and clients sometimes confuse estate planning with tax minimization. Tax minimization plans can go awry for two separate reasons. First, the plan may fall to deliver the anticipated tax savings. The plan may be fine when designed, but it may produce an unexpected and unwelcome result because tax law, financial conditions, or family dynamics have changed by the time the plan operates. The second reason plans fall is that although the plan minimizes taxes, the estate plan causes resentment and splits the family apart. Estate plan failures can result from communication problems--either among family members or between the client and the estate planner. Planners' preference for number-crunching and reluctance to deal with messy emotional family issues can lead to an inappropriate estate plan. Estate plans can also create serious ethical problems for both planners and executors. Planners need to consider family conflicts, sibling rivalries, substance abuse, and the marital and financial status of heirs, as well as assets and liabilities. An estate plan that minimizes tax can also be a failure if it increases family hostility. Handing the next generation a time bomb does them no favors. Successful estate planning requires dealing not only with financial issues but family issues as well. Advisors and clients shouldn't confuse estate planning with tax minimization.

Financing Health Care in Retirement,Changes in both the private health insurance market and in the Medicare program will profoundly affect retirement planning. The creation of health insurance exchanges will increase access to health insurance coverage for individuals retiring before they are Medicare eligible. Supplemental coverage to Medicare may become more expensive and/or less comprehensive for future retirees. Changes to the payment methodology for Medicare Advantage plans may reduce the number of plans marketed and increase both the premiums and enrollee cost sharing. And changes in the organization and delivery of care under Medicare may restrict beneficiary choice of providers and reduce out-of-pocket costs.

Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Taxation-What Have We Learned and What Should We Do?,"Corporate-Owned Life Insurance (COLI) proceeds paid on the lives of highly compensated employees or highly compensated individuals are subject to income taxation to the extent they exceed policy basis unless prior to policy issue each insured is given written notice of the employer's intention to own and be the beneficiary of coverage on his or her life, not to exceed a certain amount. In an attempt to correct certain unacceptable practices in the marketplace, Congress has thrown a net so broad that it has created and will continue to create unwanted consequences for the uninformed or inattentive.

Tax Diversification in Retirement Planning,"The concept of tax diversification is a relatively new approach to planning for retirement income and is now becoming an essential component of planning. The conventional wisdom in saving for retirement has been to defer paying taxes as long as possible. That strategy may have served many retirees well in the past with most depending on a defined benefit to live on in retirement; however, it may not be a viable strategy today. Reasons for this transformation point to the current level of tax rates, which are historically low; companies shifting from funding defined-benefit pension plans to funding defined-contribution plans; and finally, the changing government policies that can have a significant impact on a retiree's standard of living. The objectives of this paper are to look at why tax diversification is increasingly more important today, examine the different tax treatment of certain accounts, and finally, analyze various spend down strategies that reduce the tax burden placed upon retirees.

Is Risk Tolerance Stable? The Role of Projection Bias,"Financial advisors would be well directed to measure their clients' tolerance for risk on an ongoing basis. This is particularly true whenever market conditions change significantly from the original client data-gathering-process environment.

Strategy Compilation for a Successful Retirement Income Plan,"A balancing act must take place when selecting retirement income strategies. Planners must find the proper equilibrium that will effectively negate a variety of postretirement risks while leaving the client with enough assets to maximize his or her standard of living. Finding the right combination of products, strategies, and investments (strategy compilation) can enhance the client's chances for both a secure retirement and the greatest possible spending power. The puzzle needs to fit together without any holes and with as little overlap as possible. One facet of strategy compilation centers on testing combinations of strategies to discern the most cost-effective way to handle a risk. Another facet of strategy compilation is finding efficiencies by allowing one or more strategies to serve as a hedge against multiple risks. This facet does not shut down all risks. It does, however, address the age-old financial planning conundrum of allocating limited resources to multiple priorities by allowing clients to find trade-offs with which they are willing to live.

Tipping the Scales with the Wait-and-See Life Exchange,"The wait-and-see life exchange technique is based upon recently published Revenue Ruling 2011-28, which provides that a grantor's retention of power, exercisable in a nonfiduciary capacity, to acquire a life insurance policy held in trust by substituting other assets of equivalent value won't, by itself, cause the value of the insurance policy to be includible in the grantor's gross estate, assuming certain conditions are met. This article explores the benefits and considerations of this technique and its applicability to the modern client.

Assessing the Risk Attitudes of Private Investors Using the Implicit Association Test,"The new European regulation on financial markets requires consultants to assess clients' risk attitudes before advising them on financial products.

The results of 66 IAT participants are compared with their answers from a risk tolerance questionnaire used by practitioners. Low correlation coefficients show that implicit attitude, and therefore unconscious and uncontrolled thinking, can differ from conscious processes (explicit attitude).","Fehr, Robert R, MSc;Hari, Juerg J, PhD", Feature,Nov,2014,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Studies , Regulation , Correlation analysis , Risk assessment , Attitudes , Financial planners , Europe",ProQuest One Academic

Parents Subject to Alternative Minimum Tax: Waiving the Dependency Deduction for the Children Who Incurred Qualified Education Expenses,"The provisions of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) can result in a ""curse"" beyond the additional tax caused by the AMT itself. Taxpayers subject to the AMT will find that claiming their dependent children does not lower their overall tax liabilities. Furthermore, most taxpayers subject to AMT will likely have modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) beyond the limit permitted to claim education expense credits for their dependent children. This is the AMT curse -- no tax savings from claiming a dependent child and no tax benefit for education expenses because of excess MAGI. In this article a real-life case is used to apply the provisions of Reg. § 1.25A-1(f)(1) to partially mitigate the AMT curse. This regulation allows the AMT taxpayer-parent to waive claiming the student-child as a dependent, which then permits the ""dependent"" child to claim a qualifying education expense credit (assuming the student-child has sufficient tax liability) even though the student-child is prohibited from claiming a personal exemption. This results in a tax saving to the dependent child that otherwise would be lost, but does not increase the overall tax liability of the AMT taxpayer-parent who waives the dependency exemption.","Hargadon, Joseph, PhD, CPA, CMA;Marley, Megan, MST;Shea, Theresa, MST, CPA", Feature,Nov,2014,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Studies , Education expenses , Alternative minimum tax , Tax benefits , Taxpayers , Dependents , Children & youth , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Stocks and Bonds: What to Put In and What to Leave Out of Individual Retirement Accounts and Qualified Plans,"When funding an individual retirement account or qualified plan (herein referred to as qualified accounts), an individual might face the issue of how best to allocate stock and bond investments between qualified accounts versus making investments outside such vehicles through taxable in vestments. Accordingly, this article develops a framework for deciding whether an individual is better off investing in stocks through qualified accounts while investing in bonds through outside accounts (stocks-in/bonds-out) versus investing in bonds through qualified accounts while investing in stocks through outside accounts (bonds-in/stocks-out) The best allocation depends on factors such as rates of return, tax rates, and the investment horizon.","Anderson, Kenneth E, PhD, CPA;Murphy, Daniel P, PhD, CPA", Feature,Sep,2014,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Studies , Bonds , Stocks , Qualified pension plans , Asset allocation , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

When Is the Roth Conversion Optimal?,"Planning for retirement can be a complex and stressful task. One of the most common dilemmas many face is whether to use a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The Roth IRA has always been the more enticing of the two since the words ""tax free"" can be so inviting. For some the choice is easy since they are disallowed from making contributions based on the government's income limitations. With the passing of a recent law allowing anyone to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, the availability is now across the board. However, should everyone convert? There are serious tax ramifications and other issues that need to be considered before that is answered. This article examines various situations and strategies to help outline who should convert and who should not.","Cellucci, Robert, CFP", Feature,Sep,2014,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Selection , Conversion , Tax free , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Retirement planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Decanting: Give New Life to an Irrevocable Trust,"Decanting, the process of transferring trust assets from one irrevocable trust to another, provides practitioners and clients alike with the unique opportunity to rewrite an irrevocable trust.

A Review and Assessment of Using Grantor-Retained Annuity Trusts to Affect Tax-Free inter Vivos Wealth Transfers,"Grantor-retained annuity trusts (GRATs) are both a popular and oftentimes controversial means of achieving intergenerational wealth transfers. The adoption of Chapter 14 of the Internal Revenue Code made the use of short-term GRATs more practical and effective for tax planners. This article explains and presents a variation on the design and use of short-term GRATs to maximize wealth transfers. Unlike previous studies, the article compares the effectiveness of alternative GRAT strategies over a 20-year planning period using actual returns and Section 7520 rates rather than historical averages. The authors identify and examine the drivers of short-term GRAT success to affect intergenerational wealth transfers: GRAT term length, investment risk, and portfolio composition. Unlike previous studies of this issue, GRAT strategies are simulated and assessed for a specific planning period extending from 1993 to 2012. The results show that the use of 2-year, layered, zero-out GRATs is a superior means of affecting wealth transfers over more traditional, longer term GRATs.

Reversing the Decline in Life Insurance Ownership,"The explosion of new insurance products, new distribution methods and channels, and research that indicates consumers want more life insurance have not produced the sales gains that would normally be expected in such a climate. In fact, sales have plummeted over the past 40 to 50 years. To be sure, regulatory demands, increased compliance requirements, and consumer demands have made life insurance sales more complicated.

Retirement Account Options When Beginning a Career,"When college graduates begin their careers, they face a number of financial choices and obligations. Their choices typically include one or more retirement account options. The options generally include individual retirement accounts (IRAs) (Roth and/or traditional), 401(k) plans (Roth and/or traditional), and, possibly, 401(k) contributions matched by the employers. In this article, a decision-making hierarchy is provided. The hierarchy ranks all of the retirement account alternatives in order to facilitate choices that are tax efficient and maximize wealth. A simplified version of the ranking is as follows: (1) Roth 401(k) with matching employer contributions; (2) traditional 401(k) with matching employer contributions; (3) Roth IRA; (4) Roth 401(k); and (5) traditional 401(k).

Helping Clients Initiate Their Personally Chosen End-of-Life Strategies,"Families now routinely make advance directive-type decisions for relatives, many of whom are cognitively impaired, elderly, or nearing death. These decisions are often required under severe emotional distress and are often followed by guilt and self-doubt that could probably have been ameliorated and certainly better anticipated with competent advance directive guidance from a caring financial planner. The financial planner is often best situated to initiate a process-oriented advance directive exit strategy developed from knowledge of the family gathered over the years. This article also analyzes important, unsettled issues, such as the role advance directives should play in conditions other than terminal illness and permanent unconsciousness, and whether a client's decision-making capacity should be considered variable, depending upon the specific treatment choice being addressed in the client's personally chosen exit strategy. In helping families honor the wishes of decision-impaired loved ones, the financial planner should help the client shift focus from specific therapies to documented discussions of general preferences and values, intended to place the client's family in the best position to make in-the-moment decisions when needed.

"The Case for Survivor Purchase Options in Estates of the ""Mid-Wealthy""","History shows us that the law regarding federal transfer tax is ever changing. The economic fortunes of clients can be ever changing as well.

The purchase of Survivor Purchase Option riders, especially for the ""mid-wealthy,"" is then analyzed, as a flexible alternative to survivorship life insurance which, when owned by an irrevocable trust, is a trapped asset unavailable to the surviving spouse who may face tough choices when his or her mate dies.

Federal Insurance Office Issues Long-Anticipated Insurance Regulation Report,"In late December 2013, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Federal Insurance Office (FIO) submitted to Congress and released a report on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States.

The report also concluded that states continue to be individually involved.

Long-Term Care Financing Reform: Leveraging Existing Tax Incentives for Employer-Sponsored Plans,"Long-term care expenditures are among the main reasons an individual's retirement plan might fail to meet his or her full retirement needs. However, many advisors are not making their clients feel any more secure about being able to deal with long-term care expenditures in retirement. As such, new strategies need to be examined for improving long-term care security in retirement. One potential strategy is for advisors to work directly with employers to increase participation in group long-term care insurance programs.

Section 79 Plans-Benefits beyond Permanent Life Insurance Needs,"One of the jobs of the accountant, attorney, and financial planner is to help clients implement strategies to reduce their tax liabilities while still meeting their lifetime financial goals and protecting their heirs. The challenge to completing these strategies is the intrusion of income taxes -- best illustrated in qualified plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and Roth IRAs. Whether qualified plan or IRA, the issue is preventing a client's low-tax money going in from becoming highly taxed money going out, when there is also a need for the death benefit that life insurance provides. For this purpose, it may be useful to review the often overlooked Section 79 plan. This article seeks neither to promote nor dispatch Section 79 strategies, but to determine whether the unique advantages and disadvantages of this type of plan may assist or disadvantage a client.

"Closing the Retirement Expectations ""Gap:"" Variations in Demographics, Sources of Information, and the Implications of a ""Bad Guess""","This article utilizes survey information to provide a measurement of the gap between what workers believe they need to live comfortably throughout their retirement years and what is likely to actually be required. It then examines how these perception gaps vary with income, type of employer-sponsored plan coverage, and expected retirement age. A simulation model is then used to determine which sources of information appear to provide workers with the most accurate assessment of their retirement needs. Finally, the implications of inaccurate retirement needs assessments for employers, workers, and public policy are discussed.

Greatly Reduced Life Expectancy: How Should It Affect a Couple's Social Security Claiming Strategy?,"Suppose a male has been diagnosed with an illness that reduces his life expectancy to two years. How should this reality affect his decision and, if applicable, his wife's decision, for claiming Social Security benefits? If he is younger than Full Retirement Age (FRA) and qualifies for Social Security disability benefits then he should begin those benefits today. If he is 1) at least FRA or 2) does not qualify for disability benefits then their best strategy usually depends on whether the surviving spouse can grow her retirement benefits at 70 to exceed her survivor benefits. If the answer is yes, then he generally should begin his Social Security retirement benefits today, while she should delay her retirement benefits until age 70. If the answer is no then he should not begin his retirement benefits, while she should begin her retirement benefits today (if not already begun).

Estate Plans Reconsidered with New Tax Rates,"When avoiding estate taxation was the primary objective of the trust, the trustee with discretionary control over income might not distribute income to a beneficiary if the income was unlikely to be spent. Making distributions to a beneficiary who would keep the income would defeat the purpose of the trust to shelter funds from estate taxation. That dynamic may be altogether changed by the expanded estate tax exemption and higher income tax rates. Now it's often better to distribute income to the trust beneficiary to avoid the greater tax costs incurred when the highest tax bracket applies to the trust.

The Lifetime Sequence of Returns-A Retirement Planning Conundrum,"Individual investors are extremely vulnerable to the sequence of market returns experienced over their investing lifetimes. Individuals who behave exactly the same over their careers, saving the same percentage of the same salary for the same number of years, can otherwise experience very different outcomes based solely upon the specific sequence of investment returns that accompanies their careers and retirements. The vulnerability reaches its peak at the retirement date, as this is the point at which a return to employment becomes increasingly difficult and a postretirement market drop can be devastating. Actual wealth accumulations and sustainable withdrawal rates will vary substantially for different retirees, as these outcomes depend disproportionately on the shorter sequence of returns just before and after the retirement date. This article quantifies the nature of this vulnerability and outlines some potential ways in which advisors can help protect clients from the sequence of returns risk.

Understanding Alternative Options to Abandoning Unnecessary Life Insurance Policies in Retirement,"As individuals age, many factors such as changing needs, rising premiums, medical expenses, financial troubles, divorce, cash need, and changing costs of insurance may drive them to seek other insurance options or abandon their existing insurance policies altogether. Often, individuals feel that their only options are to let the policy lapse or surrender it, but there are several options available that may be more attractive. Section 1035 exchanges to annuities or long-term care policies will allow the policyholder to access the cash value for lifetime income or use the cash value to fund a long-term care policy. Life settlements may provide a benefit that is significantly greater than simply surrendering a policy and often provide a profitable exit strategy that addresses the policyholder's goals and objectives.

It can be difficult to obtain designated beneficiary status for a trust which has multiple purposes and multiple subtrusts, such as a revocable living trust.

412(e)(3) Defined-Benefit Plans: A Second Chance at Retirement Savings?,"According to 2010 U.S. census data, there are 10.1 million self-employed individuals and 10.3 million independent contractors in the United States. A recent study shows the most pressing financial challenge facing small-business owners today is developing a retirement plan and exit strategy. In fact, 55 percent of small-business owners are not confident they will have enough savings to retire comfortably. Most have the majority of their wealth tied up in their businesses and have not taken seriously the need to be saving for their looming retirement. A 412(e)(3) plan can offer the second chance at saving for retirement that so many small-business owners need. As an alternative to traditional defined-benefit plans, 412(e) (3) plans create large income tax deductions while funding a large tax-advantaged source of income at retirement, all over an accelerated time period and without a mandatory funding requirement or investment risk.

Another Look at Lump-Sum versus Dollar-Cost Averaging,"Debate regarding the efficiency of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) has persisted over the years. In this column we are going to add to the debate by showing that depending on the market and investor, DCA can sometimes be a smart investing tactic and occasionally an inefficient allocation approach. An investor who strongly believes that a bull market is about to begin, or one who is making an investment during the early stages of a bull market, should use a lump-sum strategy. Obviously, making such a prediction is no easy task. it turns out then that making a lump-sum investment requires a relatively high level of risk tolerance (low risk aversion). When working with clients who have less tolerance for financial risk, a DCA strategy provides a way to outperform if a bear market, rather than a bull market, emerges. Even if a cyclical bull market occurs, the opportunity cost is not that large. In the final analysis, the advantages of a DCA approach match well with the needs of average investors.","Grable, John E, PhD;Chatterjee, Swarn, PhD", Journal Article,Sep,2015,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Investment , Investors , Lump sum , Risk aversion , Bull markets",ProQuest One Academic

IRS Issues a New Interpretation of Section 409A,"For an employer who prior to the vesting of amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred-compensation plan discovers that the plan has an operational or form failure under Section 409A, there are three lessons that can be taken away from an IRS Chief Counsel Memorandum. First the correction of a failure to comply with the requirements of Section 409A is not effective to correct that noncompliant deferred-compensation plan in time to escape the resulting adverse tax consequences to the employee to the extent that the deferred amounts become vest- ed at or before the end of the taxable year in which the correction is made. Second, nothing in the Memorandum precludes the correction of a noncompliant nonqualified deferred-compensation plan in a taxable year prior to the taxable year in which the deferred amounts vest. Third, to the extent that a noncompliant deferred-compensation plan contains vested amounts, whatever correction mechanism that may be available to the employer to undo the noncompliance is set forth in the correction procedures established in IRS Notices 2008-113 and 2010-6.","Schneider, Paul J, JD, LLM", Journal Article,Sep,2015,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Notices , Memoranda , Nonqualified pension plans , Internal Revenue Code , Compensation plans , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The purpose of the research described in this paper was to determine whether collectible U.S. postage stamps have a place in an investor's portfolio or whether stamps primarily share characteristics with other noninvestment collectibles. Results indicate that, in general, collectible stamps do a relatively good job hedging inflation and declines in gold prices.

Many quality insurers can adequately address these exposures, especially when the insurance is crafted to the exposures; a few insurers market exclusively to this sector.

"The ""Rollover as Business Start-Up"" Strategy-Should Your Client Use Retirement Rollover Funds to Finance a Business?","Planning for the small-business owner requires a financial planner to wear many hats. Financial planners perform a variety of tasks to ensure that the business runs smoothly and has the proper benefits in place, and to guarantee that the business continues after an owner's death. However, before planners get to help out with current and future operations of the small business, they may be called upon to help create the business in the first place. A unique method currently being used to create small businesses is using a qualified retirement plan rollover to start the new business. The ""rollover as business start-up"" strategy (commonly referred to as ROBS) poses some challenging financial planning issues. Some believe ROBS are misused rollovers destined to wreck retirement (and potentially an abusive tax practice) and others believe ROBS may be the fuel needed to help the client reach his or her dream of business ownership.

Emerging Issues in Deferred Compensation:: Can an Employer Be Liable for a Participant's FICA Taxes?,"In an earlier column we examined the manner in which deferred compensation is subject to FICA taxes, including the special timing rule and the related nonduplication of wages rule.

This observation was based on an unpublished 2013 decision in Davidson v. Henkel Corporation. The plaintiffs in that case recently won that litigation on a motion for summary judgement. This issue's column examines the Davidson decision in greater depth and determines how that decision may be applied to future litigation involving the application of FICA taxes to deferred compensation. It also analyzes what the implications of that decision will be for both the employers who maintain deferred-compensation plans and the employees who are participants, and addresses how the result in Davidson can be avoided through proper drafting.

When to Stretch and When Not to Stretch an Inherited IRA: The Special Case of the Special Needs Trust,"Use of the stretch strategy for an inherited IRA offers many attractive features for estate planning. In the area of special needs trusts (SNTs), many advisors also favor the stretch strategy to fund or help fund the SNT. Nevertheless, this article suggests there are at least three scenarios facing SNT planning where the stretch strategy may not be prudent: (1)where the IRA is the sole source of funding for the SNT and required minimum distributions are insufficient to meet the present needs of the beneficiary; (2) where the life expectancy of the beneficiary is projected to be short and other end-of-life issues and expense favor greater funding of present needs over future needs; and (3) where a contingent beneficiary becomes disabled after the creation of the SNT, the trustee is empowered to create a new third-party trust to support the newly disabled beneficiary, and the IRA is the sole source of funding for the new trust. This article reviews these issues in the context of a growing market for special needs planning, a review of the conventional planning wisdom on the stretch strategy, why special needs planning requires special care, and why scenarios where the stretch is not prudent create special implications for financial planners.","Hershey, Lewis, PhD, MA;Abbey, Boris, PhD, JD, MBA;Stanaland, Terence B, JD, ChFC, CPA;Owens, Terry L, CFP, CLU, ChFC, CRPC, CMFC, LU", Feature,Mar,2015,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Studies , Disability pensions , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Beneficiaries , Estate planning , Funding , Planning , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Equity-Based Compensation for Partnerships: Tax Court Breaks New Ground,"A recent Tax Court decision with respect to the tax treatment of the grant, ownership, vesting, and forfeiture of a compensatory capital interest in a partnership has brought further clarification to this area of the tax law. Based on the tax principles articulated in this decision, it is important that financial service professionals differentiate between a profits interest and a capital interest. Even if a compensatory capital interest is granted, the recognition of income is deferred until the interest becomes vested unless the recipient makes a Section 83(b) election. Until a capital interest is vested, no undistributed income will be allocated to the holder of the interest. And finally, from a planning perspective, a partnership should make sure that it is granting a profits interest to a service provider unless there is a clear intent to provide a capital interest.","Schneider, Paul J, JD, LLM", Feature,Jan,2015,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Vested benefits , Tax court decisions , Executive compensation , Partnerships , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Financing the Medical Expense Deduction for Families with SDecial Needs Children I,"The number of children diagnosed with autism, Asperger's syndrome, and other intellectual disorders continues to skyrocket. A previous column (Brinker, Journal of Financial Service Professionals 65, No. 5 (2011): 16-18) highlighted that parents with special needs children are often unaware of the substantial tax benefits available to them and often forgo hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars of potential tax deductions. Although the focus in the 2011 column was on the expanded definition of medical care as a deduction for families, another reality inevitably surfaces: finding the wherewithal to finance these expenditures. Parents of special needs children quickly discover that medical care expenditures for a special needs child can prove astronomical. As a result, parents and their financial advisors need to become familiar with some unusual IRC provisions that may assist and/or hinder their process. This article focuses on two common resources often utilized in financing medical care: home equity loans and retirement plan and individual retirement account distributions.

However, in recognition of a historical tax status that predated the enactment of IRC Sec. 409A, that section does provide an exemption for certain forms of stock rights.

Beyond the Department of Labor: Is a Life Insurance Agent a Fiduciary?,"A used car salesperson sells an automobile to someone who walks onto the car lot. Most would agree that the relationship between the salesperson and buyer does not rise to that of a fiduciary. In contrast, consider the duty a trustee owes to a minor beneficiary. The trustee is expected to provide knowledgeable advice, display loyalty, and avoid any conflicts of interest. The trustee is clearly a fiduciary. Now imagine something in the middle. What kind of relationship exists between a life insurance agent and a client who purchases a life insurance policy or annuity? Does this involve buying a product or receiving advice--or both?

Financial Literacy Overconfidence and Financial Advice Seeking,"This study examines potential effects of overconfidence on financial advice usage. Financial literacy overconfidence is defined as the gap between consumers' subjective and objective financial knowledge. Using a representative national survey, the result shows that over 11 percent of respondents display financial literacy overconfidence: They score higher than the average on perceived financial knowledge but are unable to answer three or more financial literacy questions correctly. These overconfident consumers are less likely to seek professional financial advice in saving/investment and mortgage but more likely to exhibit demand for advice related to debt counseling and tax planning.","Pocto, Nilton, PhD;Xiao, Jing Jian, PhD", Feature,Jul,2016,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial literacy , Tax planning , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Collecting Social Security versus Spending Retirement Savings,"Although the Social Security claiming decision (when to first claim benefits) reflects a wide range of personal factors, this paper examines only the case of an individual who will retire (or has already retired) at age 62 and has sufficient resources to meet desired after-tax spending without relying on early claiming of Social Security benefits. The analysis in this paper finds much of the previous literature is biased against early claiming of benefits because it uses inappropriately low discount or earnings rates. Treating the claiming decision as an investment (present value) decision, with proper consideration of historical market returns, inflation, and current mortality rates, men should generally begin to collect what benefits they can, subject to the earnings test, as soon as they can. At higher market return expectations, women are also better off claiming benefits as soon as possible, but at normal or lower returns they are better off waiting to claim at full retirement age.","Gilkeson, James H, PhD, CFA", Feature,Jul,2016,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Retirement plans , Social security , Earnings , Present value , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Challenges Immigrants Face as They Plan for Retirement,"Unfortunately, the majority of immigrants who settle in the United States do not plan for retirement because of the many financial and cultural challenges they face. These challenges include a language barrier and adapting to a new economic system and culture. In addition, because the majority of immigrants have low levels of education, they are forced to work in low-paying jobs that do not offer any form of retirement benefits in which they can participate. However, several studies have shown that immigrants are able to plan and save for retirement.

Recent Church Plan Litigation Could Affect Deferred-Compensation Plans,"Since the enactment of the Employee Retirement income Security Act of 1974, church plans have been excluded from the requirements of that statute. However, the recent Third Circuit decision in Kaplan v. Saint Peter's Healthcare System has judicially narrowed the class of qualified retirement plans that qualify for this exclusion and this, in turn, potentially threatens the status of nonqualified deferred-compensation plans maintained by affiliated church agencies, such as hospitals and schools. The church plan litigation de- scribed in this column is still in its relatively early stages and it is too soon to determine who the winners and losers may be. Clients who are plan sponsors of church agency non-qualified deferred-compensation plans and clients who are participants in such plans, particularly those church plan clients who are located in the Third Circuit, should be advised of the implications of the Kaplan decision. Those church plan clients who are plan sponsors should begin to think about ways in which the risks associated with the Kaplan decision can be mitigated. Those church plan clients who are participants also should think about what, if any, action they may want to take in order to protect their benefits under the affected plans.","Schneider, Paul J, JD, LLM", Feature,May,2016,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Federal court decisions , Religious organizations , Retirement plans , ERISA , Compensation plans , Deferred compensation , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The behavioral side of retirement has become extremely important to incorporate into planning discussions with clients, because without addressing it, even the best laid financial plan could get derailed. Drawing in part on proprietary research, this column looks at shifting attitudes towards retirement and the impact of retirement on an individual's personal identity and relationships, as well as addresses some of the challenges that can lie ahead, including diminishing mental acuity.

Even though these entrepreneurs have decades of work experience, they do not have decades of experience owning and running their own businesses. Accordingly, they will have some significant knowledge gaps about the financial realities of running a startup business and how that affects their families' finances.

Sequence of Returns Risk before Retirement,"Financial advisors are well aware that starting retirement during a bear market can significantly increase the likelihood of a retiree outliving his or her assets. At the outset of a bear market a retiree must withdraw more principal, compared to capital. While the notion of sequence of returns risk is generally well known among retirement advisors, it is important to recognize this risk also exists for those accumulating assets. The problem is clearly apparent in the context of a typical retirement financial planning case scenario.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP;Chatterjee, Swarn, PhD", Journal Article,Jan,2016,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial planning , Assets , Risk assessment , Advisors , Bear markets , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

First, while income tax planning is important, we should be careful not to allow the tax implications of a planning scenario to cloud the client's actual underlying intention. We need to always remain focused on the planning goal and try to implement that goal in a tax-efficient manner. Second, some planning ideas can be reversed in the event of a tax law shift that would affect their attractiveness.

Basis of Property-When the Estate and Beneficiary Do Not Agree,"The basis of property is crucial, since gain or loss is determined by subtracting the basis from the sales price--the higher the basis, the lower the gain. Thus, for federal income tax purposes, sellers prefer to have a higher basis, reducing their future gain. However, where property passes from the estate of the decedent, the basis of property flowing to a beneficiary is normally determined to be the fair market value of the property in question on the date of the death of the decedent. The property of the decedent is normally included in the assets of the decedent to determine any estate tax that may be owed. The result is that the beneficiary favors a position where the basis of property flowing to the beneficiary has a higher fair market value. The estate favors a lower fair market value to lower the estate tax, if applicable. These conflicting positions have been recently addressed by the government in an IRS Notice that will require--in some circumstances--that both the beneficiary and the estate use the same fair market value.

Helping Repartnered Widows Navigate Romance and Finance: The Role of Financial Advice,"This paper reports the findings from an international study designed to assess the financial satisfaction and life well-being of repartnered widows (those who are now remarried or in a long-term relationship). Based on an Internet survey that was disseminated widely among widowed support groups from around the world, findings suggest that repartnered widows who work with a financial professional before remarrying or entering a long-term relationship are more satisfied today with how they handle their finances than those who do not. Highest satisfaction was noted among repartnered widows when financial advisors talked to them about their new relationships and the related financial issues.

A Case for Incorporating Financial Wellness into Your Retirement Planning Practice,"For most American workers, being able to retire with an adequate source of guaranteed income for life is their top financial priority. Yet, the reality is that nearly 50 percent of American workers have less than $10,000 saved for retirement. In response to this savings crisis, employers have implemented financial education initiatives aimed at increasing retirement plan participation rates. Still, only 32 percent of workers report having a good understanding of their workplace retirement savings plan, and many are not taking full advantage of it. Evidence is mounting that financial education alone is not going to get people ready for retirement. What is needed to accomplish this goal is a more holistic approach, one that goes beyond retirement planning and incorporates budgeting, debt management, and the importance of having an emergency fund. Here we will examine how advisors can add value and differentiate their practice by leveraging the growing demand for financial wellness programs.","MacKenzie, Kristen, MBA, CFP, CRPC", Journal Article,May,2017,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Debt management , Workers , Demand , Wellness programs , Retirement planning , Savings plans , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Health Savings Account Strategy,"Health savings accounts (HSAs) are frequently used by clients to pay for current medical expenses. This may be a mistake.

The ability to make before-tax contributions, experience tax-free growth, and receive tax- free distributions make the HSA the most effective way to save for retirement and pay for retirement expenses. By thinking of the HSA as a financial planning tool and using money that would have been used for retirement savings to pay current medical bills, clients can maximize their assets for retirement and take full advantage of asset location to provide for tax diversification of retirement withdrawals.","Tacchino, Kenn Beam, JD, LLM, RICP", Journal Article,May,2017,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Health care expenditures , Financial planning , Tax free , Health savings accounts , Medical savings accounts , Retirement , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

A different set of issues arises for estate planners who are not well versed in life insurance and who need to know more about the product itself: where it can help, tax minefields to avoid, and how to leverage the concept in planning. In light of the uncertain planning environment created by the recent federal elections, the need for estate planners to understand life insurance is even more acute.","Parrish, Steve, JD, CLU, ChFC, RHU", Feature,Mar,2017,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Life insurance , Estate planning , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
The Worst Investment Mistake and a Simple Solution,"When clients transfer their focus to the dividend stream instead of the daily changes in total portfolio value, they will trade much less and by doing so, do much better. This is because they will be letting investment returns stem from the long-term portfolio growth of the underlying investments' value as opposed to short-term valuation and subsequent trading decisions. Dividend investing can provide clients with a ""noise filter"" that rightly steers clients away from the daily headlines. It is a commitment device that keeps investors from selling prematurely. And it offers stability: Dividend payments are a less-volatile stream of returns compared to capital gains.","Myers, Daniel, CFA, CFP", Feature,Mar,2017,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Dividends , Portfolio investments , Capital gains , Rates of return , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

These are: (1) age of disability, (2) increased likelihood of do-it-yourself account management, (3) predatory practices, (4) inheritance limitations, and (5) recapture under Medicaid estate recovery law. Aspects of how the ABLE Act is structured create openings for the emergence of scenarios that might harm the very persons ABLE accounts are meant to help, though such outcomes are not inevitable.

"Fiduciary Responsibility, 1974 to 2017","As of the writing of this paper, much of the conflict-of-interest rule promulgated by the Department of Labor (DOL) will become effective on April 10, 2017; it will be fully implemented January 1, 2018. Despite much published opposition and the talk of a rollback of regulations under the new administration, for now (and in this author's opinion, for the near future) advisors will be operating under the new rule. The adoption of the DOL's conflict-of-interest rules has sparked a renewed interest in the meaning of the terms ""client best interest,"" ""reasonable compensation,"" ""fiduciary,"" and ""impartial conduct standards."" Understanding an advisor's fiduciary responsibility is a complex, multifaceted, and, most importantly, evolving endeavor.

New Proposed Regulations Clarify and Add Flexibility to IRC Section 409A Regulations,"For the most part, the changes brought about by the new Section 409A proposed regulations are fairly technical in nature and are unlikely to have a material impact on the administration of most deferred-compensation plans.

This will be especially true in circumstances involving payments to beneficiaries; the extension of the short-term deferral rule payment period so as to avoid violating federal securities laws; the grant of stock options or stock appreciation rights (SARs) to prospective employees; a reimbursement of legal fees in connection with a litigated employment matter; the ability to repurchase stock options and SARs in the event of a termination for cause, or on account of a violation of a noncompetition or nondisclosure agreement, at a price that is less than fair market value; and the change in status from employee to independent contractor.","Schneider, Paul J, JD, LLM", Feature,Jan,2017,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Federal regulation , Stock options , Internal Revenue Code , Compensation plans , Deferred compensation , Stock rights , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Arguably, these new rules have the greatest impact on IRAs and IRA rollovers. Although compliance with the new rules obligates Society of Financial Service Professionals (Society of FSP) members to increase the paperwork associated with their representation, asking the Society of FSP advisor to act in the best interest of his or her clients should not be viewed as a new requirement.

An Assessment of Wealth Accumulation Tasks and Behaviors,"The publication of The Millionaire Next Door in 1996 by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko had a dramatic influence on the way the media and some in the financial services community came to view wealth accumulation over the life cycle. An important aspect of the book was the documentation of certain tasks and behaviors that wealth accumulators -- as defined by Stanley and Danko -- engage in on a frequent basis. Many of these activities have morphed into generally accepted standards for wealth accumulation, but few have been tested empirically. Using data from a sample designed to overrepresent high-net-worth households (n = 271), this study tested over 250 household financial management tasks and behaviors culled from The Millionaire Next Door and other related sources to determine which are effective in differentiating between those who are and are not wealth accumulators. Findings suggest that there does appear to be a core set of tasks and behaviors that helps shape wealth accumulation. Wealth accumulators tend to more frequently develop and adhere to a budget, they tend to save money on a regular basis, and they report being more likely to create plans for the future.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP;Kruger, Michelle;Fallaw, Sarah Stanley, PhD", Feature,Jan,2017,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Studies , Personality traits , Books , High income , Wealth management , Affluence , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Unethical Behavioral Finance: Why Good People Do Bad Things,"Just as people at times make bad (i.e., irrational) financial decisions, they also make bad ethical decisions. However, it is important to note that this acting badly or unethically is not always explainable simply in terms of sheer greed or blatant selfishness. Just as it is fruitful to look at the irrationalities governing financial investing, it is similarly fruitful to look at irrationalities that prompt people to behave unethically. Since sound ethical analysis requires good reasons for acting in the right way, good ethics should be a rational enterprise. However, just as we often act irrationally in making financial decisions, irrational elements can creep in to corrupt our ethical judgments and behavior. Behavioral ethics asks the question, ""Why do good people make bad decisions?"" We look at six factors: (1) weakness of will, (2) ignorance, (3) slippery slopes, (4) arrogance, (5) rationalization, and (6) docility.","Duska, Ronald F, PhD", Feature,Jan,2017,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Studies , Behavioral decision theory , Financial planning , Ethics",ProQuest One Academic

As a financial planner, you may be frustrated by the number of arguments you have likely encountered for starting benefits at age 62 despite having shown your clients the benefits of waiting. Research in behavioral economics points to the strong influence of the ""framing effect"" on claiming age.

The results of a 4-year study of over 1,500 buy-sell agreements reveal a wide range of best practices and practical recommendations.

Social Security Coverage for State and Local Government Employees,"Many government employees working in noncovered employment have no idea of the special rules that may affect their future Social Security benefits. As a result, these employees may expect to receive significantly more retirement income than will actually be paid. Contributing to this problem is the fact that Social Security Administration (SSA) itself does not know who is affected by the government pension offset or the windfall elimination provisions until the individuals apply for benefits and disclose that they are receiving pensions based on noncovered employment. Until then, the personalized earnings and benefit estimate statements that SSA provides upon request will overstate potential future benefits.

Social Security Taxation,"When the Social Security Act of 1935 was executed and a funding system was born for eligible individuals, there was no tax provision for the income that would be received. Initially, the Treasury’s underlying rationale for not taxing Social Security was around the definition of what type of income it was considered. Benefits under the act were considered “gratuities” and at that time, gifts and gratuities were generally not taxable. Social Security benefits come from three contribution sources: the employee’s payroll tax, the employer’s matching contribution, and the interest earned. Since none of the three components that make up the funding had ever been taxed, it was odd that the Social Security benefit was not eligible for taxation.","Cortese, Christopher, CFP", Journal Article,Nov,2018,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Studies , Eligibility , Taxation , Social security , Social security taxes , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Financial Planning Considerations for Americans Working Abroad,The global economy frequently provides opportunities for employees of U.S. organizations to live and work overseas. Providing financial and tax planning services to clients becomes complicated when U.S. citizens reside outside the United States.

An Update on Stable Value Funds Performance through 2017,"In defined-contribution savings programs, the two major classes of financially engineered products are target date funds and stable value funds, each with upwards of $800 billion assets under management. Recent changes in the capital markets have caused a disruption in some traditional asset allocations, including stable value funds. The term premium that has generally prevailed between intermediate-term and short-term fixed income yields has shrunken substantially over the past 2 years, and the typical yield spreads between high-grade and low-grade bonds have also narrowed. This article updates recent research to include the past 2 years of data and shows some interesting and important new results that raise crucial questions to plan sponsors. The authors examine the performance of stable value funds since their inception in 1973 and compare this with the performance of oth-erfundamental asset classes.

Intergenerational Split Dollar…The Beat Goes On,"Intergenerational split dollar has been a controversial topic, at least for the past few years. In simplified form, it consists of an older-generation person purchasing a life insurance policy on a younger-generation person.

Financial Planning Self-Efficacy: A Framework for Research and Practical Application,"The psychological nature of the financial planner-client relationship has emerged as an integral component of the value of financial advising. For the last 30 years, behavioral finance has added dramatically to the understanding of the cognitive and emotional biases that lead persons to make financially destructive decisions when faced with risk. But decision making under risk is not the only manner in which financial planners should understand the psychological behavior of their clients. This paper introduces psychologist Albert Bandura's self-efficacy and social learning theory to financial planners, offering an additional and complementary perspective to behavioral finance within the scopes of client behavior and decision making. Self-efficacy theory is not part of the Certified Financial Planner® (CFP®) education, so the concept of self-efficacy is likely to be unknown to most financial planners and there has been very little research devoted to financial planning self-efficacy. In this foundation paper, the definition, influences, and value of self-efficacy will be explained within the framework of financial planning and additional areas of needed exploration identified. It is important to recognize that, just as there are no systematic applications of behavioral finance for financial planners, this paper intends simply to introduce the importance of understanding self-efficacy to financial planners and offer suggestions for future research.","Haman, David C, MST, CFP;Laker, Dennis R, PhD", Journal Article,Sep,2018,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial planning , Learning , Studies , Client relationships , Behavior , Decision making , Behavioral economics , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

Defined-Benefit Plans Remain a Planning Opportunity,"Tax planning is changing, but with most of the recent attention focused squarely on the newly passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJAI [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, PL 115-97 (2017)] and the resulting tax reductions at the federal level, planning opportunities at the state level and with retirement plans have been a bit neglected. Most state governments in the United States also collect state sales, income, and property tax (being as high as 13.3 percent), which is different and separate from what must be filed with the federal income tax. While many clients will benefit from a reduction of taxes due to the TCJA, many will be losing valuable deductions, which could actually result in a tax increase. For business owners using a pass-through entity, continued planning with an employer-sponsored retirement plan could help offset the tax burden of some lost deductions. The good news is there were no major changes to the general structure of qualified plans, including de-fined-benefit plans. As such, small-business owners operating an existing plan should feel safe in the continued value of utilizing these retirement savings vehicles. But the recent tax changes have heightened the value of adopting employer-sponsored retirement plans for some small-business employers.

Extending the 60-Day Rollover Period,"With the release of Revenue Procedure 2016-47 in April of 2016, clients now have a new way of avoiding the complications of a missed 60-day rollover period. Clients can now self-certify their eligibility for an extension if certain requirements are met, eliminating the need for IRS preapproval. Therefore, planners need to explain to clients the events that could trigger the self-certification process and, perhaps more importantly, identify specific requirements that could arise under each option for self-certification. This paper examines private letter rulings regarding 60-day waivers to clarify how IRS thinking will apply to a client's specific situation. After studying the various circumstances under which waivers were granted (and perhaps more importantly, denied), a clear pattern begins to emerge. By applying these historical trends to a client's current situation, planners can help their clients identify situations in which they may receive a waiver for the 60-day rollover rule.","Tacchino, Kevin", Journal Article,May,2018,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Waivers , Eligibility , Roll over , Revenue procedures & rulings , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The Optimal Time for Claiming Social Security Benefits: A Methodological Note,"The decisions about the optimal age for starting Social Security benefits are subjects of a number of recent papers. It is generally agreed that initiating or postponing benefits may have significant consequences, but there is less agreement on how to model the problem or measure its financial implications. By law, benefits are paid only to live beneficiaries. Thus, the anticipated future benefits should be weighted by the recipient's survival probability -- the probability that the recipient is alive when the benefits will actually be received. Many published papers assume that benefits will be received ""on average"" throughout the recipient's expected remaining lifetime and estimate the present value of Social Security benefits by discounting the cash flow through life expectancy. This paper will show the preferred approach is to estimate the actuarial present value (APV), which weights each future payment by the probability that it will be received. Based on survival probabilities and life expectancy tables that are compiled by the Centers for Disease Control, the paper demonstrates that the present value through life expectancy approach overstates the APV by approximately 10 percent. Therefore, timing decisions that are not based on the APV are probably suboptimal.","Friedman, Joseph, PhD", Journal Article,May,2018,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Probability , Studies , Social security , Present value , Life expectancy , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The authors conclude that a 50-state review of ABLE Act rollouts dictates that professional planners should consider six key questions when deciding which state ABLE program best serves a client's needs: 1) Will program fees for maintenance, disbursement, print, rollovers, administration, or other services unduly burden or otherwise inconvenience the client? 2) What are the state account balance limits? 3) Is the client eligible for a state income tax credit for ABLE account use? 4) Is the client best served by a program that offers a debit or purchasing card to use ABLE account funds? 5) Does this state offer the degree of investment risk that most benefits the client? and 6) How will the investment-related fees for this particular state program impact the client? Best practices for due diligence as well as professional standards of care require that specialists be familiar with the core differences between active state ABLE account programs and then tailor their guidance accordingly.","Kelly, Annemarie, JD, LLM;Hershey, Lewis, PhD, MA", Journal Article,Mar,2018,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Professional standards , Due diligence , Financial planners , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Strategy: Using an IRA Trust for Asset Protection and Wealth Preservation,"It is often in the IRA owner's best interest to name a trust as the beneficiary of the IRA.

Should Annuities Be Purchased from Tax-Sheltered Assets?,"Retirees who purchase an annuity may assume that retirement savings accounts are ideal for funding retirement income. Annuities, however, are a tax-favored investment. The authors investigate the relative benefits of purchasing an annuity from tax-deferred and taxable accounts for various payout levels, tax rates, asset tax efficiency, and assumed portfolio rates of return. Considerable evidence is found that investors are better off using nonqualified accounts to purchase annuities, although the benefits vary significantly by investor characteristics and the tax efficiency of investments held in nonqualified savings. In some cases, selecting the right account increases the after-tax income of an immediate annuity by over 10 percent. A 15-year deferred annuity purchased from nonqualified versus qualified bonds earning 4 percent provides over 30 percent more after-tax income for a 65-year-old with a 40 percent marginal tax rate.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP;Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP", Journal Article,Nov,2019,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Investment income , Tax legislation , Tax rates , Annuities , Retirement , Retirement income",ProQuest One Academic

401(k) Plans Are Changing Investors' Experiences,"Over the past four decades, the 401(k) plan has evolved and grown to be the most common defined-contribution (DC) plan. This article explores how plan sponsors' decisions with respect to plan design and investment offerings impact the financial experience of 401(k) plan participants over time. Millions of Americans are first introduced to investing through their 401(k) plans, and changes in 401(k) plan design impact the financial experience of 401(k) participants. Given that many households with rollover individual retirement accounts (IRAs) seek the assistance of financial advisors, the changes in 401(k) plan investors' engagement with their accounts' investments may change the financial background of these new advisory clients.

Planning for Capital Gains and Losses,"All financial planning strategies involve purchasing assets and holding them for a period of time before either selling them or gifting them to another individual or entity.

U.S. Supreme Court to Review the Issue of Taxation of Trust Beneficiaries Based on their Residency,"In recent years, a popular and quickly growing technique involves a grantor in a high-income-tax state setting up an irrevocable trust in a state without a state income tax. These trusts are sometimes referred to as incomplete grantor trusts (ING) trusts. The idea is that by placing assets in an irrevocable, non-grantor trust, in a state without an income tax, the income on the assets is not taxed, thus avoiding the state income tax. If the assets were not placed in trust, the resident state where the grantor lives would tax the income return on those assets. It is important to note that a nongrantor trust means that the trust itself is a taxable entity. Under older law theories, only the state where the trust is located, its situs, can impose an income tax on the assets. A number of states have enacted tax laws to collect income taxes on these out-of-state trusts. The issue is going before the U.S. Supreme Court.","Commito, Thomas F, JD, LLM, CLU, ChFC, AEP", Journal Article,Jul,2019,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Supreme Court decisions , Irrevocable trusts , Situs , Tax legislation , Grantor trusts , Income taxes , Trusts , State court decisions , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

The relationship between expenses and performance is much stronger than the relationship between tracking difference and performance.

Is a 401(k) Loan in the Client's Best Interest?,"There are at least 18 factors that need to be considered when deciding whether a client should take a 401(k) loan. Financial planners must carefully consider each of these issues in light of the client's unique circumstances. This article introduces a method for planners to use when approaching the plan-loan question. Any examination of the inquiry of which loan best suits the client's needs is aided by first understanding the rules governing plan loans. The considerations that compel a choice to use the 401(k) plan to provide the loan are investigated. Reasons a commercial loan may be advantageous are then considered. Finally, a deeper dive is taken to analyze the opportunity cost of having retirement funds ""out of the market"" when high returns occur; how the planner can avoid the repayment of a loan by reducing plan contributions and retirement readiness; and whether there is a double tax on loan repayments. The provided checklists can be used to guide planners through the decision process.","Tacchino, Kenn Beam, JD, LLM;Wendling, Kathleen", Journal Article,Jul,2019,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial planning , Commercial credit , Deferred compensation , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

These strategies do not require traditional preferred provider organization networks and, thus, take leverage away from network purveyors. The three trends discussed in this article are: (1) technology-enabled health benefits; (2) direct contracting between employers and providers; and (3) reference-based pricing.

Based on several different scenarios, the authors conclude that the value of the tax savings from premium conversion outweighs the loss of Social Security retirement benefits, but the loss of Social Security survivor benefits and Social Security disability benefits outweighs the value of the tax savings for an employee and family members who would qualify for them.","Avila, Stephen M, PhD, CPCU;Athavale, Manoj, PhD;Gatzlaff, Kevin, PhD", Journal Article,Mar,2019,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Disability , Employee benefits , Social security , Tax exempt , Insurance premiums , Retirement",ProQuest One Academic

Using Roth Conversions of Legacy Retirement Plans to Fund Special Needs Planning,"Financial planners who engage in special needs planning (SNP) must be careful not to overlook legacy retirement plans (i.e., plans from previous employers) as possible sources of funding. While some research exists on the best practices for using Roth individual retirement account (IRA) conversions for general estate planning and wealth transfers, there is little guidance available on how to use Roth conversions of legacy retirement plans to fund SNP tools, such as special needs trusts (SNTs) and Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE or 529A) accounts. This article exam- ines the strategy and reasoning for using Roth conversions of legacy retirement plans and suggests there are at least seven advantages of this strategy for clients with SNP issues: 1) access to funds at age 59 1/2, rather than 70 1/2; 2) no required minimum distribution (RMDs) in the lifetime of the account owner; 3) no future taxes; 4) reduced risk; 5) wealth transfer in perpetuity; 6) generally not subject to Medicaid recapture if properly structured (subject to certain conditions); and 7) no limitation on the amount of money that can be converted.","Hershey, Lewis, PhD, MA;Kelly, Annemarie, JD, LLM", Journal Article,Mar,2019,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial planning , Retirement plans , Roth 401k plans , Retirement planning , Planning",ProQuest One Academic
Removing the Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust as the Default in Estate Planning,"Life insurance in estate planning needs a fresh look.

The Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Small Businesses,"In December 2017 Congress passed the first major tax reform since 1986, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill introduced by President Trump and the Republican party promised to simplify the tax code and tax filing process as well as bring lower taxes to nearly all Americans. The primary accomplishment of the bill is the lowering of the corporate tax rate to a flat 21 percent.

Planning for Hobby Loss,"As most planners are aware, clients who own their own business are entitled to deduct any losses incurred as a result of running the business (IRC Sec. 162(a) and IRC Sec. 212(a)(1)-(2)). However, if clients misclas-sify their operations as a business, when the IRS would classify them as a hobby, they could be on the hook for back taxes, as the IRS will disallow their loss deductions (IRC Sec. 183(a)). Within the IRS regulations, there are nine factors which, when applied to a client's situation, will point in the direction of either a business or a hobby. Planners can create value for their clients by implementing strategies around these nine factors to help prove a clear, intentional profit motive if a client's business is ever under review. This paper seeks to explain the purpose and use of each factor, as well as highlight planning opportunities that each factor presents.","Tacchino, Kevin, MSTFP;Wandling, Stephanie, CPA, MSTFP", Journal Article,Jan,2019,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial planning , Hobbies , Investment advisors",ProQuest One Academic

Twenty-Five Examples Illustrating How 529 Plans Can Benefit Clients,"A basic discussion of 529 plans might seem unwarranted since qualified tuition programs have been around since 1996 and many financial service professionals already help clients establish these plans. However, law changes have been made in two successive years so a refresher may be useful. In addition, planners new to the profession or expanding their practice to include education planning might benefit from a review of the current state of the 529 plan strategy. To this end, we will look at the tax benefits provided under the plan, a variety of new and old alternative uses for funds accrued in the plan, the two fundamental types of 529 plans, plan investment options and related considerations, the rules for changing beneficiaries in order to avoid unwanted tax consequences, and some potential drawbacks to implementing this popular education planning strategy.","Tacchino, Kenn Beam, JD, LLM", Journal Article,Jul,2020,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Qualified tuition programs , Tax benefits , Financial planners",ProQuest One Academic

This also shifts the risk of premium increases to the employee. In addition, employers can offer another form of HRA that is allowed to purchase excepted benefits.

In preparing for retirement, many U.S. workers, because of the weak social safety net and their small amounts of savings, need to use defined-contribution pensions, such as 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts, as piggy banks when facing liquidity problems.","Turner, John A, PhD;Klein, Bruce W, PhD", Journal Article,Nov,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Studies , Mental health care , Mental health , Retirement planning , Pension plans , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic
Taking the High Ground on Financial Literacy,"A recent partnership among some of the largest corporations in the country puts a new spotlight on an old issue-financial literacy. This latest effort to expand corporate and national attention to this issue is no modest goal but can benefit from already existing programs and resources that have been addressing this challenge for decades. Focusing beyond age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status, this issue already has many advocates and resources whose efforts have been generally successful but the knowledge base, although improving, remains much lower than desirable. Research has identified adult populations including preretirees, women, and low- to middle-income families who can substantially benefit from financial literacy programs, as well as the financial institutions who engage in programs, products, and services relevant to their needs.","Migliaccio, John N, PhD, RFG, FGSA, MEd", Journal Article,Nov,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Funding , Literacy , Socioeconomic factors , Studies , Financial literacy",ProQuest One Academic
Buy-Sell Basis Primer: Step Up Your Knowledge of the Basics,"Every few years or so, with this year being no exception, there is talk in Washington of eliminating or reducing one of the greatest real or perceived tax benefits out there for the wealthy, the so-called stepped-up basis for property passed on at death. The concept of basis itself, and its impact on income and capital-gains taxation, is an often-overlooked aspect of estate and business planning as some advisors may choose to instead focus on transfer (estate, gift, or generation-skipping) taxes. In the context of a closely held business, the step-up is there for the survivors, often the estate who may immediately sell the interest, but it also may be of particular benefit to those who stay involved with the business although anticipate some future lifetime sale.","McLennon, Mark, JD, CPA/PFS, CFP, CLU, ChFC", Journal Article,Nov,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Real estate , Studies , Taxation , Tax legislation , Income taxes , Capital gains",ProQuest One Academic

Considering Life Insurance in a Qualified Plan: A Fiduciary Guide,"The fiduciary of an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) trust has responsibilities and must follow certain duties. A person is a fiduciary if they exercise any discretionary authority or control over the management or disposition of the plan's assets, render investment advice or have any authority or responsibility to do so for a fee or other compensation, or have any discretionary authority or responsibility in the administration of the plan. The fiduciary must discharge those duties as a prudent person would, with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence of a person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters. ERISA Sections 404(a)(1)(A) and (B) require plan fiduciaries to act prudently and solely in the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries. This article outlines several areas to consider and guides a fiduciary through the consideration of purchasing life insurance as a means of providing a preretirement death benefit in a plan.","Guerriero, Ernest, CLU, ChFC, CEBS, CPCU, CPC, CMS, AIF, RICP, CPFA", Journal Article,Nov,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Investment , Studies , ERISA , Insurance policies , Life insurance , Fiduciary responsibility , Fiduciaries",ProQuest One Academic

How Are Social Security Benefits Taxed?,"It is surprisingly complicated to ascertain the amount of Social Security benefits that your clients must include in their taxable income. The good news is that at least 15 percent of Social Security retirement benefits are excluded from tax, and in some cases, Social Security benefits are totally exempt. In addition, clients who are able to lower their adjusted gross income (e.g., by taking tax-free Roth or health savings account (HSA) distributions instead of taxable retirement distributions) may decrease or eliminate the amount of their Social Security income that is subject to taxation. The bad news is that tax-exempt bonds and harvested capital gains lose some of their luster if the taxation of Social Security benefits is a concern for your client.","Tacchino, Kenn Beam, JD LLM", Journal Article,Sep,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Tax legislation , Tax benefits , Social security , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic

Nevertheless, self-employed individuals and independent contractors still can deduct their business expenses, including those related to home offices. Employees working from home for an employer whose office is in another state may be subject to some surprising and complex state income tax issues.","Schneider, Paul J, JD LLM", Journal Article,Sep,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Work at home , Tax legislation , Financial services , Taxpayers , Income taxes",ProQuest One Academic

The Value of Delayed Social Security Claiming for Higher-Earning Women,"This study estimates the expected benefit from delayed Social Security claiming for higher-earning, healthier women who can expect to receive more future income payments than other Americans. The expected net present value of Social Security payments from delayed claiming for healthy women is $179,999, or more than twice the value of delayed claiming for a male of average health. The benefit from delayed claiming ranges from a low of $16,548 per year to $29,395 per year for healthy women. Even women of average health gain at least $132,202 in Social Security wealth by waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security income benefits. Significant gains to women who delay claiming are robust even considering a possible 2 percent increase in real discount rates and a 21 percent reduction in income that could occur if the Social Security trust fund depletes in 2026. The added benefits from reduced longevity and inflation risk suggest that the failure to delay claiming results in a significant loss in both retirement wealth and expected welfare.","Duffy, Sophia, JD CPA;Finke, Michael, PhD CFP;Blanchett, David, PhD CFA CFP", Journal Article,Sep,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Women , Womens health , High income , Social security",ProQuest One Academic

The Effectiveness of Financial Education on Emerging Adults,"The effectiveness of financial education is controversial and calls have been made to change its delivery methods. Still, more recent studies show benefits of financial education for consumer financial capability and well-being. This study takes advantage of new information available from the 2018 FINRA Foundation's National Financial Capability Study to examine how financial education attributes, such as requirement, hours, and quality, can enhance the financial capability of emerging adults aged 18-25. Financial capability is defined as the ability to apply financial knowledge and perform desirable financial behavior for achieving financial well-being and measured by both objective and subjective factors. Results suggest that different financial education attributes may have different impacts on financial capability factors. When financial education is required and more hours of instruction are received, the financial knowledge of emerging adults could be improved. Further, as the quality of the financial education improves, emerging adults could gain more confidence in their financial knowledge, perform more desirable financial behaviors, and feel more capable to handle their own finances. The findings emphasize the importance of financial education quality in improving financial capability of emerging adults.","Porto, Nilton, MBA PhD;Xiao, Jing Jian, PhD", Journal Article,Sep,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Adults , Financial planning , Financial literacy",ProQuest One Academic

Criminals Targeting Retirement Accounts Create a New Use for Crime Insurance,"Participants in 401(k) plans are protected by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) against malfeasance and procedural errors of the ERISA fiduciaries for those retirement and other benefit programs. ERISA imposes fiduciary duties and liability for their breach, but ERISA does not impose strict liability for losses that are outside of the fiduciary's control. This means criminal theft of money from those accounts is not covered by ERISA fiduciaries. Other financial laws protect consumers against theft from banks, such as the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA), and against insolvency, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). These do not apply to 401(k) plans. As criminal attacks on 401(k) plans increase, some ERISA fiduciaries have declined to reimburse for criminal losses. If this is a trend, participants and IRA investors should consider a crime insurance policy until a regulatory solution fills the gap in protection.","Weston, Harold, JD, CPCU", Journal Article,Jul,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," ERISA , Crime insurance , Roth 401k plans , Insurance policies , Fiduciary responsibility , Fiduciaries , Deferred compensation",ProQuest One Academic

On the Way to Financial Freedom When Beginning a Career,"This article provides a rank ordering of the most tax-efficient financial moves an employee should make when beginning a career. Ideally, the first two moves should be made together: put the maximum into a health savings account if the employee has high-deductible health insurance and put enough into a 401(k) account to obtain the maximum employer match. The next step is to pay down and ultimately pay off all high-interest-rate debts. The fourth step is to contribute to a Roth IRA annually since the contributions can be used for emergency spending needs tax free.","Geisler, Greg, PhD, CPA", Journal Article,Mar,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Employee benefits , Individual retirement accounts--IRA , Human resource management , Deferred compensation , Medical savings accounts",ProQuest One Academic

Consumer-Directed Health Plans,"Although consumer-directed health plans (CDHPs) (also called high-deductible health plans) have affected health care utilization, they have had limited success in altering enrollees' behavior as consumers.

The experience over the last 15 years has been to increase lower claims by either attracting lower-risk enrollees or by reducing the purchase of health care services. To be effective insurers, employers and other plan sponsors need to develop strategies to enhance enrollees' engagement and effectiveness as consumers.","Custer, William S, PhD", Journal Article,Jan,2021,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Health care expenditures , Primary care , Cost analysis , Consumer behavior , Consumers , Consumer-driven health plans , Health insurance",ProQuest One Academic

The five fundamental cost components of any life insurance policy (six, if investment management costs are separated from administrative costs) are: sales, claims, administration, premium taxes, and capital charges. Policies with investment components require additional disclosures (i.e., returns, portfolio characteristics, etc.) and an explanation of their tax privileges' ramifications. Additional disclosure-related aspects are discussed.

Step-Up in Basis in a Distribution from an Irrevocable Grantor Trust,"For many planners, being able to achieve a step-up in basis at the death of a client is the most important tax planning goal in developing the plan. In many instances, this supersedes the goal of minimizing estate taxes. The reason for this is that, with the currently large exemption, for many clients the estate tax is minimal or nonexistent. Most planners are familiar with the basic step-up rule of Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 1014, namely, that if property is includible in the estate, the assets receive the step-up. However, IRC Sec. 1014 is more complex than that. The highest planning result, obviously, would be in having assets being estate tax free and still getting the step-up. As a result, a number of tax professionals are revisiting what at the time was a little-noticed Private Letter Ruling from 2012. In this ruling, a grantor irrevocable trust received a stepup in basis when the assets were distributed at the death of the grantor. This renewed interest has con-currently spurred Congressional calls for repealing the ability to get this seemingly double tax benefit. This article describes in detail the operation of IRC Sec. 1014 and how the IRS reached the positive decision in 2012. It examines the basis for the decision, as well as some of the current counter arguments. In addition, it examines some other arguments supporting the 2012 decision.","Commito, Thomas F, JD, LLM, CLU, ChFC, AEP", Journal Article,Nov,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Real estate , Irrevocable trusts , Taxation , Tax legislation , Taxpayers",ProQuest One Academic

Financial Health Assessments by People with Disabilities and Their Families during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Opportunities and Obstacles for Financial Planners,"The current article presents the findings of a quantitative study of 3,886 adults with disabilities and family members of people with disabilities to examine their financial health during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020–March 2021). This study provides hard data to highlight how the first year of the pandemic has exacerbated long-standing obstacles in servicing potential planning clients with disabilities. Participants assessed their overall financial well-being by completing a web-based survey to provide information about the state of their individual or family incomes and financial planning behaviors. Two key findings are germane to financial service planners and the special needs planning (SNP) industry: (1) three quarters of individuals reported that their incomes were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; and (2) nearly a third of people with disabilities and their family members have no financial literacy education or training in SNP matters. Collectively, these findings identify both a knowledge gap and a means gap that must be addressed to provide financial planning services to a larger portion of the disabilities market. The vast majority of individuals with disabilities desire, intend to obtain, or are already obtaining some form of financial literacy education or financial planning resources.","Kelly, Annemarie M, JD, LLM;Gilden, Cory, PhD;Bailey, Caitlin, PhD;Hershey, Lewis B, PhD, MA;Sticinski, E Virginia", Journal Article,Sep,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," COVID-19 , Financial planning , Financial literacy , Coronaviruses , Pandemics , PSYCHOLOGY",ProQuest One Academic

In other words, the retirement plan provides numerous benefits and a business that does not take advantage of these will lose out on a valuable opportunity.","Tacchino, Kenn Beam, JD, LLM", Journal Article,Jul,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Small business , Taxation , Revenue , Tax shelters , Retirement planning",ProQuest One Academic
Financial Satisfaction Postwidowhood: The Role of Resilience,"The death of a spouse or partner is a significant, and potentially devastating, form of adversity. Widowhood can result in numerous negative outcomes for the surviving spouse or partner. However, it is possible for someone who experiences widowhood to transform the experience into a higher level of functioning. It is thought that resiliency-a personal attribute that allows someone to manage adversity and transform negative life events into positive outcomes-is one factor that corresponds to better postwidowhood outcomes. The purpose of this study is to estimate the degree to which postwidowhood financial satisfaction, experiencing financial challenges, and disagreeing about money issues among remarried and repartnered widows and widowers are associated with resiliency. Based on the results from three regression models, it was determined that higher levels of resiliency are associated with greater financial satisfaction, fewer financial challenges, and fewer money disagreements after remarriage or repartnering among widows and widowers. Results from this study have practical implications for those who provide financial advice to others. Financial service professionals are in a unique position to help clients who experience widowhood improve self-efficacy by promoting a sense of worth and purpose in the context of household finances and life functioning among clientele.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP;Mattia, Laura, PhD, CFP;West, Carrie L, PhD;Leitz, Linda Y, PhD, CFP;Rehl, Kathleen M, PhD, CFP, CeFT", Journal Article,Jul,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Widows & widowers , Financial planning , Deaths , Income , Financial management",ProQuest One Academic
Social Security Differences by Gender,"While Social Security law is now completely gender-blind and has been for close to 40 years, the effects of Social Security's various provisions on each gender vary quite a lot. Some of the differences in outcomes by gender appear to be exogenous and not amenable to any legislative solution. They highlight the fact that financial planning for retirement at advanced ages is even more important for women than it is for men, because women are much more likely to survive to the oldest ages, while having the least financial resources available.","Schobel, Bruce D, FSA, MAAA, CLU, CEBS", Journal Article,Jul,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Legislation , Financial planning , Social security , Gender equity",ProQuest One Academic

The preamble to the 2020 PTE includes an interpretation that alters longstanding guidance on how the DOL will determine whether a person is a fiduciary by reason of making a recommendation to rollover plan assets to an IRA.

Emotional Attachment and Decision by Family-Business Owners to Seek Help from a Succession Planner,"Many family-business owners (FBOs) desire to pass the business on to future generations, yet few transitions are successful. Studies point to irrational emotional attachment as the primary cause. Succession planners could help, but few FBOs seem to seek their services. This article studied FBOs' irrational emotional attachment to their firms (and other psychological factors) and the impact this has on their decision to seek help from a succession planner. The study found that FBOs with a low level of emotional attachment sought help from a succession planner, while those with an irrationally higher emotional attachment did not. Psychological factors were also associated with the decision to seek help. These findings can help financial planners avoid wasting time and resources by avoiding FBOs that are highly emotionally attached and instead focus on prospects with lower emotional attachment.","Hiebert, Daniel, PhD, CFP", Journal Article,May,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Decision making , Emotions , Family owned businesses , Succession planning",ProQuest One Academic

Gold Bullion versus Gold Miners: Does Volatility Make a Difference?,"This article examines adding gold to a portfolio either through a gold bullion (GLD) exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a gold miner ETF (GDX). Bullion funds track the price of gold extremely well and tend to be far less volatile than gold miner funds. Jonathan Clements, the former Wall Street Journal reporter and founder of the ""HumbleDollar"" blog, indicated that he prefers gold miner funds because of potential better rebalancing opportunities.

Social Security Coordination to Create a Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Strategy,"Many financial advisors consider tax brackets when recommending a withdrawal strategy for their retired clients. However, they should look at marginal tax rates. Due to the taxation of Social Security benefits and income-based Medicare premiums, the marginal tax rate for most retirees on a wide range of their income is substantially higher than their tax bracket. This study shows that, by focusing on marginal tax rates, an advisor can add significant value to clients' financial accounts by recommending a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy that outperforms withdrawal strategies that only focus on tax brackets.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA;Meyer, William", Journal Article,Mar,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Withdrawals , Tax rates , Social security taxes",ProQuest One Academic

Before financial counseling, there was great disparity in financial knowledge among subgroups, and after financial counseling, this disparity mostly disappeared. Financial counseling seems to create balance in financial knowledge among subgroups, as significant differences in financial knowledge among subgroups largely vanish after counseling.","Gallardo, Juan E, MBA;Moore, Christoper M, MBA, CFP;Scott, Andrew, MBA", Journal Article,Mar,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Financial counseling , Financial planning , Financial literacy",ProQuest One Academic

For the community of life insurance carriers and producers, perhaps the most harmful paradigm in the design and sale of universal life insurance is the expectation that policies intended to last a lifetime can be purchased with minimal deposits of money and assumed constantly projected high interest rates or subaccount returns or index increases-which can be counted on for the next 50-70 years.","Weber, Richard M, MBA, CLU, AEP", Journal Article,Mar,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Interest rates , Insurance policies , Life insurance , United States--US",ProQuest One Academic

Love and Legacy: Are Children's Affections Related to Parents' Bequest Intentions?,"This study investigated whether positive and negative affection shown by children towards their parents was associated with their parents' bequest intentions. In a final sample of 1,534 adults aged 50 and older, a positive relationship was found between positive affection and bequest intentions. Surprisingly, no relationship was found between negative affection and bequest intentions. These results suggest that in cases of a distant or strained relationship, parents are reluctant to disinherit their children. Based upon these findings, financial service professionals should not assume that challenged parent-child relationships warrant the need for alternative beneficiaries. Instead, given the clients' potential lack of strong emotional bonds with their children, financial service professionals are encouraged to help clients consider other opportunities to maximize emotional well-being and overall life satisfaction.","Sommer, Matthew, PhD CFA CFP;Lim, HanNa, PhD CFP", Journal Article,Jan,2022,Journal of Financial Service Professionals," Parents & parenting , Children & youth , Financial services , Bequests",ProQuest One Academic
