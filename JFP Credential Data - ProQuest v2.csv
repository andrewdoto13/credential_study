JFP,Seeking Nirvana Amidst Chaos,"Buddhism teaches that the only constant in life is change. The last year is a testament to that. Despite how well some people felt they had everything in order, the pandemic showed us that you need to always be ready for disruptions. That alone has changed the entire nature of work for many, including financial planners. There are many challenges, and opportunities, that financial planners will face going forward, and embracing technology will play a central role. A demographic shift is coming as Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, are rapidly becoming the generation to focus on. Today, Millennials range from ages 25 to 40. There has been a sharp rise of fee-only advisers, and for good reason. There is a poignant distrust of the financial industry as Millennials have lived through two ""once-in-a-lifetime"" recessions.","Cummings, Bridger",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Dec,2021

JFP,Establishing Financial Self-efficacy Among African American Students,"A financial literacy gap exists between African American students and their White peers. According to Huston (2010), financial literacy comprises three components: objective financial knowledge (knowledge of financial facts), financial management (experience), and financial self-efficacy (confidence). This study looked at the interaction of these three components to better understand how financial literacy develops for African American college students in comparison to their peers. The findings suggest that for African American students, objective financial knowledge is not directly or indirectly associated with financial self-efficacy; only financial management is effective to establish financial self-efficacy. For their non-African American peers, both financial knowledge and financial management play a role in developing self-efficacy. Financial practitioners and educators can use these findings to create culturally responsive financial education programs to help increase financial self-efficacy and close the financial literacy gap between African American college students and their peers. Current and future financial education curricula should focus not only on how individuals perform financial management behaviors but also how to help increase a person's financial self-efficacy.

JFP,Using Scaffolding Learning Theory as a Framework to Enhance Financial Education with Financial Planning Clients,"Financial professionals face client resistance to professional recommendations that can result in long-term effects on the outcomes of financial plans. Scaffolding Learning Theory is an effective method of teaching in various educational settings, from elementary school through college. However, financial professionals have rarely applied this theory to financial planning and literacy education. This article presents the principles of Scaffolding Learning Theory and, through a case vignette, provides an illustration of its application in both working with clients to assist in financial education, and in promoting a collaborative relationship with financial planning clients. Moreover, the case vignette elucidates differences between what clients can do with and without help, and provides a robust discussion of the benefits to financial professionals when implementing the Zone of Proximal Development concept when working with clients.","Sterbenz, Elizabeth, LMFT;Ross, Dylan L, CFP® AFC;Melton, Raylee;Smith, Jed;McCoy, Megan, PhD LMFT CFT-I;Pearson, Blain, PhD CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Dec,2021

These advisers didn't want a networking opportunity or a referral relationship with one another--those are simple one-offs. Instead, they sought a deeper, more meaningful exchange where helping clients was the common goal.

Clients are coming to planners with preconceived notions about whose interests they're serving and how they're compensated. Planners are developing innovative business models that let them build the practices they want. This thoughtful approach helps with big-picture planning, but finding the capacity to do everything they want to is a challenge many advisers face in their careers.

JFP,"To Reduce the Risk of Retirement Portfolio Exhaustion, Include Home Equity as a Non-Correlated Asset in the Portfolio","Financial planners have long regarded diversification and asset allocation as essential tools for reducing portfolio risk for their clients. This is especially true for retired clients who regularly draw on their portfolios for income. Another essential tool for risk reduction, but one not adequately recognized by financial planners, is the inclusion of home equity in the retirement portfolio, as an asset along with, and similar to, investment securities. An essential aspect of the inclusion of home equity in the portfolio is a withdrawal strategy that, in a disciplined way, uses that asset. The inclusion of home equity as an asset in the portfolio is notional; the equity serves as a source of retirement income just like the other assets in the portfolio, according to the algorithm described herein; but there is no transfer of ownership, control, or management of the home. This paper consolidates the results of several previously presented research papers and recasts them into a novel approach to the meaning of ""risk"" for certain retirees. These retirees are those whose primary source of retirement income is a securities portfolio; typically, but not necessarily, a 401(k) account or a rollover IRA. This paper is primarily an instructional vehicle, both to help financial service professionals better understand this vital concept of risk reduction and to help them better educate their colleagues and their clients about the concept. Financial planners who have clients approaching, or having recently entered, retirement, should revise their understanding of how to view the volatility of securities portfolios. For clients who are mid-career and are building wealth (i.e., not distributing from their portfolios), short-term volatility generally does not present a significant risk. By contrast, for clients who are retired and are distributing primarily from a securities portfolio for their normal living expenses, short-term volatility is risk. The adverse effects of regularly distributing from a volatile portfolio can be substantially diminished by distributions from the home equity instead of the other portfolio assets whenever determined by the algorithm described. The term ""risk"" is only meaningful if expressed in terms of a chance, a probability, of a specific event adverse to the interests or well-being of the person bearing the risk. Risk, in the context of retirement, means the probability of cash flow exhaustion or the probability of a required significant reduction in lifestyle or spending level. The probability of such an event is the measure of the risk about which this paper is concerned. Examples are presented to Illustrate the use of home equity as a component of the portfolio to Increase the percentage of Initial distribution from the securities In the portfolio to a level substantially above the traditional 4 percent and still retain an acceptably low risk of cash flow exhaustion. Financial planners who act In a fiduciary capacity should recognize the utility of the added diversification resulting from the inclusion of home equity In retirees' portfolios, and should Include this asset In fulfillment of their fiduciary duty of diversification of Investments In order to reduce risk.","Walker, Philip;Sacks, Barry H, PhD JD;Sacks, Stephen R, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Dec,2021

To be clear, this article does not aim to develop an optimal withdrawal strategy.

Trudy has several tips that she discussed with other financial planners, as well as a ""secret recipe"" of five C's that she incorporates into all her networking efforts. One of her general tidbits of advice is to try to seek out one-on-one engagements.

Personal income taxes are a significant source of revenue to the states. For example, the Oregon personal income tax is estimated to account for 87 percent of the state's entire general fund revenue. Currently, 42 states in the US impose a personal income tax, with one of them (New Hampshire) only taxing dividend and interest income. Of the taxing states, 10 have a single-rate tax, while 32 states and Washington DC have graduated rate income taxes. Hawaii, with 12, has the most graduated brackets in the country. The impact of state tax liability is not to be underestimated. For example, California has a top marginal rate of 13.2 percent--the highest of any state--and no capital gains rate. The largest combined local and state tax rate in the nation, paid by the highest income earners in New York City, is currently 14.8 percent under recent legislation.

Yet there's something in those words of praise that advisers should also hear: a warning. If something unexpected happens to you, who would take care of your clients? It's not a rhetorical question. At Commonwealth, they've seen a lot of bad things happen to good advisers: an adviser who was hit by a bus and was in the hospital for months; sudden illness and heart attacks; and wildfires that consumed an adviser's office and forced her to evacuate.

Whether you're looking to hire an administrative assistant, chief operating officer, or even an associate planner, one thing is for certain--hiring is expensive. New hires cost your firm a significant amount of money in salary and benefits. They also ""cost"" your firm time, energy, and resources to find candidates, train them, and ensure that they'll be a valuable fit on your team. Once you hire, you also run the risk of having your new employee leave shortly after hiring. Worse yet, they might not be a fit for your practice--leaving you with the unpleasant task of letting them go. The truth is that hiring can be a pain.

Here, Lubinski sets the definition of ""mass affluent."" Equifax defines mass affluent as individuals with $100,000--$1 million of investible assets, while Nielsen defines this group as having income-producing assets between $250,000--$1 million. It has been his experience that most advisers' clients fall into the mass affluent category.

When examining each emerging market country, their contributions to these figures vary dramatically relative to each other. Yet as emerging markets collectively continue to gain prominence on the global stage relative to developed countries, they expect investors to be rewarded over time--not for increased growth, but rather increased risk. Many investors, however, are less likely to share our enthusiasm. Emerging markets generated 4 percent annually in total return during the 2010s, the asset class's worst decade for investment performance, according to MSCI. As a result, many investors are assessing their clients' allocation to emerging markets; either conceding to concerns for the decade-long breakdown in risk and reward, or embracing the opportunity for potential outperformance given each client's objectives and expectations.","Marotta, Ryann, CFA CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Oct,2021

Almost all of them were related to outdated technology and communications operations. Clients and tax professionals who are trying to meet their obligations are being stymied by the agency's own infrastructure. Collins noted in her report that IRS employees answered less than 24 percent of the phone calls they received.

JFP,O.C.E.A.N.: How Does Personality Predict Financial Success?,"Purpose: Research across fields suggests that the Big Five personality traits (O.C.E.A.N.) predict individual behaviors including various financial outcomes. However, O.C.E.A.N. as a measuring tool has not caught on in the academic or applied financial planning field as extensively as it has in other disciplines. The purpose of this paper is to be the first to examine the relationship between the Big Five personality traits (O.C.E.A.N.) and four regularly collected financial outcomes-financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, income, and net worth-using a single data set. The correlational format shows the potential predictive ability of personality on various financial behaviors that is succinct and easy to understand. Hypothesis: The research hypothesis is that O.C.E.A.N is a significant predictor of financial outcomes. Specifically, 14 out of a possible 20 correlations between O.C.E.A.N. and financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, income, and net worth will be significant. Methods: Personality, financial literacy, income, and net worth were collected using a significantly powered current MTurk sample (n=412) representing the U.S. population. Correlations and OLS regressions were run controlling for age, gender, and education to test the relationship between the variables. Findings: 16 out of a possible 20 correlations between O.C.E.A.N. and financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, income, and net worth were significant, though some were different than hypothesized. Specifically, this study was the first to find that extraversion correlated positively with financial risk-taking and income but negatively with financial literacy. There was no significant relationship with net worth. Conscientiousness correlated positively with financial literacy, income, and net worth, but negatively with financial risk tolerance. Neuroticism correlated negatively with financial literacy, income, and net worth. These findings contribute to the financial planning field by demonstrating that O.C.E.A.N. can be simply and systematically collected from individuals-much like risk tolerance-which adds insight into specific financial behaviors. Possible Research Directions: Much like the systematic adoption of risk tolerance, the academic field of financial planning can be advanced by collecting robust personality data using the O.C.E.A.N. framework. This will allow for the generalization of findings from other fields over to financial planning. To assist researchers, the University of Michigan should consider adding robust measures of financial risk tolerance and personality to its valuable Health and Retirement Study. In addition, practicing financial professionals should consider collecting O.C.E.A.N. data on clients to gain additional insights into clients' behaviors over and above standalone risk tolerance.","Exley, Jim, CFP;Doyle, Patrick, PhD;Snell, Michael;Campbell, W Keith, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Oct,2021

What is the underlying concept of the DJIA? The word is in the title: average. It relates to the average stock price of the 30 stocks in the DJIA. That is, add all 30 stock prices and divide by a divisor. Why should anyone care about the average price of a group of stocks?

Today, some CRM systems integrate with major social media platforms, so you can glean key personal information while staying compliant with data aggregation guidelines. While this capability is still in its early stages, it could yield significant business-building opportunities down the line. This can also assist in managing connections outside of the direct network. A CRM is a powerful but frequently underutilized and mistrusted tool.

There is an opportunity available for many such retirees to either completely avoid or significantly reduce this additional cost at the start of their retirement. This opportunity can save some single retirees on Medicare anywhere from approximately $1,700 to $9,500. This opportunity can save some married retirees, if both are on Medicare and file one joint income tax return, anywhere from approximately $3,400 to $19,000.

Their reasons may be complex or even unclear, and uncovering these truths is an important step in getting clients to positive outcomes.

JFP,Minimizing the Damage of the Tax Torpedo,"By coordinating a Social Security (SS) claiming strategy with a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy, financial planners can add substantial value to many clients' accounts by helping them reduce their lifetime income taxes. The case below illustrates how a planner can add substantial value to a mass-affluent client with $1 million of savings by helping them minimize the adverse effects of the ""tax torpedo."" The tax torpedo refers to the income range wherein each dollar of additional income causes another $0.50 or $0.85 of SS benefits to be taxable. Thus, taxable income increases by $1.50 or $1.85. So, the marginal tax rate (MTR) is 150% or 185% of the tax bracket, where MTR denotes the additional taxes paid on the next dollar of income. Here, Reichenstein explains how financial planners can help many clients avoid, or at least minimize, the adverse effects of this tax torpedo.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA",1,1,10,1,11,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Sep,2021

That's why he founded his firm, Illumint, to help the underserved millennial market learn how to build the life they want with the money they have. Like many new planners, Mahoney began by offering comprehensive advising services, but he found he was getting approached by a lot of millennials. Offering issue-based packages felt like a natural fit for Mahoney's clients, but it went against the grain of what he had learned in his CFP® program, where providing good financial advice meant being holistic and covering all the essential areas of financial well-being.

JFP,The Importance of Managing Life - Stage Risks for an Aging Population,"When financial advice professionals talk about ""risk,"" they are usually referring to the risks associated with a portfolio of investments. Advisers typically view the preservation of wealth through successful portfolio risk management as their number one job, and in most cases, their compensation is tied directly to the performance of client investments. Today, that is no longer the case. Longer lifespans have dramatically changed the nature and severity of the financial risks faced by most clients, especially older adults. Life expectancy was 58 years for a man born in 1930 and about 61 for a woman. Today, a typical 60-year-old man can expect to live another 23 years; a woman, 25 more years. When longevity risk is applied to individuals, it refers to the chance that a person will outlive their savings. Moreover, running out of money is not the only financial risk confronting older adults.","Heye, Chris, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Sep,2021

Suitability and the assessment of risk when investing are important functions of a financial planner's planning and investment management process. Without an accurate assessment of a client's risk tolerance, a planner might be surprised when a client is underwhelmed by their portfolio's performance or when the client is upset at short-term investment losses. Regardless of the motivation, accurately assessing risk tolerance is more difficult than many would like to admit. Most assessments of risk tolerance rely upon a single mode of assessment, either a stated preference or a revealed preference. Ultimately, both come with significant limitations. Many assessments attempt to quantify something that may not be fully measured in a numeric form.","Yerger, Daniel, CFP®, ChFC, AIF, CDFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,21-Sep,2021

JFP,The Role of Personal Financial Salience,"The concept of Personal Financial Salience (PFS) can help explain the varying ranges of sensory responses individuals give regarding their personal financial situation. Sensory responses are operationalized by the level to which individuals allocate attentional, perceptual, and cognitive resources to their personal financial situation. Individuals who frequently use app-based and web-based financial planning products are allocat ing attentional resources to their financial situation; thus, financial planning product usage serves as a proxy to measure study participants' PFS. Data collected from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study (N = 18,231) show that 2,610 (14.3 percent), 5,861 (32.15 percent), and 9,760 (53.54 percent) of participants frequently, sometimes, or never use financial planning products, respectively. The findings from multivariate analyses highlight that when compared to individuals who never use financial planning products, those who sometimes and those who frequently use financial planning products are more likely to find it easier to cover their bills, have an emergency fund, have a plan for their children's college education, and have a plan for retirement. Financial planners can effectively utilize the concept of PFS in their practices. Creating an organizational hierarchy of financial task assignments and respective completion dates instills PFS. Furthermore, coordinating task assignments with salient reminders can further strengthen PFS and healthy financial behaviors.","Pearson, Blain, PhD CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Aug,2021

In reviewing situations to consider, CFP Board's Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct (www.cfp.net/ethics/code-of-ethics-and-standards-of-conduct) will provide the ethical frame of reference. At this point, a CFP® professional should review the requirements from CFP Board's Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct before accepting an engagement with a potential client with whom the financial planner has a COI.

JFP,"How to Estimate ""The End"" of Retirement","Client-specific information can and should result in significantly different forecasted retirement periods. After a review of assumptions used in 31,211 financial plans in Canada, retirement end age assumptions do not appear to be very personalized, given the prevalence of certain end ages, especially those that are a multiple of five (for example, approximately 70 percent of plans used age 90, and 20 percent of plans used age 95). Assumptions used by financial advisers also did not appear to incorporate the additional ""tail risk"" associated with the longer potential retirement period for a married couple. The length of retirement in a financial plan should be determined considering the shortfall aversion metric (for example, probability of success) to ensure recommendations are not overly conservative. Adding five years to projected life expectancy for a single household and eight years to the longest life expectancy of either member of a joint household (or to each member if separate end ages are used), at retirement, is an appropriate retirement end age assumption if the outcome variable is the probability of success (using a Monte Carlo model) and only fixed periods can be modeled (mortality rates are not directly incorporated). This approach suggests a retirement period of 30 years (to age 95) is a reasonable assumption for the average 65-yearold male/female couple retiring today. Retirement period assumptions should be revisited regularly to ensure they are timely, similar to other key assumptions in a financial plan.","Blanchett, David M, PhD CFP® CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8,1,9,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Aug,2021

JFP,The Four Behavioral Horsemen of Finance,"Some clients trust themselves to identify stellar stocks too much. A lot of investors who are found to be overconfident tend to trade too frequently, often at the cost of future gains, according to PIMCO. Many studies have shown that clients who made frequent trades made less money, as cited in several journals including the Journal of Finance. People hate being wrong. That extends to buying stocks. Sherman Wealth Management says that people will sometimes hold onto a stock that is going down in value because they don't want to face the truth that they have lost money. Everyone has a limit to the amount of attention they can give to any one topic.

JFP,The Reimagination of Conventional Retirement Savings Wisdom,"On Mar 11, 2021, newly elected Pres Joe Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package designed to lift the US economy out of recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The act primarily centers on rebate checks, credits, subsidies, and exclusions, but that is not what has everyone talking. Instead, it is Biden's proposed tax plan--which primarily focuses on America's high-income and wealthy individuals. Conventional planning wisdom tells us two things. First, you should start saving early and often so you can enjoy the miracles of compound interest. Second, tax avoidance (not evasion) is perfectly acceptable and encouraged, and you should only pay what you owe. As such, the choice of retirement saving vehicles becomes a critical decision toward long-term financial success. Generally speaking, lower marginal taxpayers will benefit more from post-tax accounts such as Roth 401(k)s and IRAs because their marginal rate will likely be higher in future years.","Johnson, Dan, CFP®, EA",0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Aug,2021

On Creating Rational and Impactful Goals,"Ryan Murphy, PhD, and Samantha Lamas work in an area of the profession where human nature and market science intersect. In their latest project, a nationwide study that won the 2020 Montgomery- Warschauer Award, they tackled a complex question: Why do investors say they want one thing but pursue other courses of action? Their team's initial search led them to the literature on cognitive blind spots, the ways that people become blind to mistakes they are making. As they researched further, they discovered that these well-established patterns in behavior science were wreaking havoc in financial planning conversations. Along with their teammate Ray Sin, PhD, Ryan and Sam developed and tested a three-step technique to help investors become more aware of their true financial goals. The experimental approach was centered on a simple checklist that helped clients slow down and consider the full range of possibilities, then choose investment objectives that were truly compelling and personally meaningful.","Moore, Hannah, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Jul,2021

This could include experience with a prior employer, prior employer type, or prior profession. Prior experience in these areas provide an automatic niche of expertise, and your name is already known to former colleagues as an internal expert. If you're a career changer, you are coming at the financial planning profession in a non-traditional way. That may mean finding part-time work on nights and weekends while you persist in the prior profession to keep your income up, especially if you have a family to support. Specializing in one or a small handful of similar, large companies will give the career changer an automatic niche of expertise and allow them to leverage prior experiences.

In 2019, the American Public Education Foundation found that 34 states earned grades of ""C"" or less for financial literacy instruction in their schools, and just 16 states earned grades of ""A"" or ""B."" This is where financial advisers as a profession need to organize efforts nationally and locally to drive financial literacy education in every community. There is clearly a gap.

JFP,Moments of Transition: Exploring Retirement Communities with Clients,"As our clients move from pre-retirement years to early retirement years to later years, many things will shift--from risk levels, to income, to daily responsibilities. In light of that, many clients will begin to have major discussions around healthcare options and costs, around transitioning their home life, and possibly including migrating to a continuing care retirement community. Each of these conversations can be a turning point for both their personal and financial life, and as financial planners, it's important we are well-versed in the nuances of these decisions. Following are some points to equip financial planners in three specific areas: Medicare premiums and life changes, selling a primary residence, and considerations for transitioning to a retirement home. It's likely most clients will experience decision-making around one or more of these as they work with a financial planner.","Stephenson, Angie M, CFP®, CPA/PFS",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,1,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Jul,2021

But these are also important points that financial advisers can discuss with their clients to help guide them toward a healthy and effective retirement.

They can't imagine, or don't want to imagine, a time when life is far different from today. The intent of this paper is to help financial professionals overcome this objection by providing them with the most recent data concerning LTC and caregiving, and suggesting positioning strategies (which are called ""Points of Engagement"" in the paper) to facilitate the discussion. This dialogue will open the door to additional discussions about investments, wealth transfer, financial planning, and product options.

We know that today's consumers interact with money in a stream of transactions and decisions each day.

JFP,The RISK That Households Take: A Behavioral Variable Worth Watching,"Over the past several decades, behavioral economics has brought to light numerous systematic investor violations of rational behavior. These results will come as little surprise to financial advisers who counsel clients every day, and they underscore that aggregate markets may behave in such a way as to reflect these systematic investment biases. It is the aggregation of these behavioral tendencies, and the predictability that they impart on asset markets, that motivated the development of the cyclically adjusted PE ratio (CAPE) as a predictor of US and international equity markets. RISK is easily built from publicly available data and can be demonstrated to forecast long-term aggregate equity market returns with an effectiveness similar to CAPE. Perhaps more importantly, RISK appears to have greater forecasting effectiveness than CAPE at the one-year return horizon, which is particularly useful for financial planners.","Fink, Jason D, PhD;Fink, Kristin E, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Jul,2021

JFP,Future Investment Returns on Housing Are Stark,"Early life experiences shape your lens of money throughout your life. If you grew up in the Great Depression, you thought of the stock market as risky. It's the opposite for baby boomers. Boomers--who profited from the bull market of the 80s and 90s--had a relatively positive experience with stock market investing. Millennials have their own distinct lens. They witnessed their boomer parents do well by real estate--at least for the most part. For many millennials, the investment returns on a personal residence are guaranteed (with the occasional bubble thrown in to keep you on your toes). Here, Luskin recently thought of this millennial real estate investing paradigm when chatting with an old friend. They were talking about personal finance. His friend was convinced that maxing out his 401(k) was completely unnecessary. That's because he was planning to cash out on his personal residence in retirement, using the proceeds to fund his golden years.

JFP,The Time for ESG Investing Is Now,"In the realm of ESG investing, people know two things to be true: investor demand is increasing, and the supply of investment product is vast and bewildering. In 2020 alone, over $50 billion was added to ESG investment funds--more than double that of the previous year. Although opportunity abounds for those who stand ready to navigate the ESG waters, many financial advisers are still wary of properly researching and implementing ESG investment strategies for clients. ESG stands for environmental, social, and governance, and is best thought of as a Venn diagram highlighting sustainability factors for a given company. Asset managers source data from companies to measure and analyze these factors, allowing them to create investment products favoring companies that compare relatively well. ESG investing is by no means a passing trend. In fact, the concept of impact investing predates modern financial markets with references in early religious texts that continue to guide investment philosophies today. Now known as socially responsible investing (SRI), this form of impact investing uses negative screens to exclude stocks in certain industries that do not align with an investor's values.","Marotta, Ryann, CFA CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Jun,2021

In blog posts that McManus wrote for FPA in 2020, she stressed how vital it was for advisers to reach out to clients regularly so you could still connect personally, even if you couldn't meet in person. Clients needed to know you were still invested in looking after them. And then, in June 2020, J.D. Power made a shocking reveal: almost 33 percent of clients had not heard from their adviser in the first three months of COVID-19. During a period that included a pandemic, schools transitioning to remote learning, businesses reimagined or shuttered, social unrest, and the largest one-day, one-week, and first-quarter market drops in history, clients would have benefited enormously from guidance. Communication is a key driver to creating client loyalty, and those advisers who were silent during 2020 may be facing the consequences. According to a recent Fidelity Investor Insights study, 20 percent of clients changed financial advisers in 2020.

The positive association between income and retirement preparation was partially explained by financial self-efficacy. · Results suggest that the relationship between confidence in achieving a financial goal and retirement preparation is negative and significant. The more confident respondents appear to be about their ability to accomplish a financial goal, the less likely they are to be actively contributing to a retirement account. · These results can guide financial advisers to target individuals who might stick to a retirement plan and encourage these working investors to actively contribute to their retirement plans. · Financial advisers can also guard their clients against becoming overconfident in their ability to achieve financial goals as this may be a deterrent to contributing to a retirement plan.","Sturr, Tim, CFP®;Lynn, Christina, CFP®, CDFA®, AFC®;Lawson, Derek R, Ph D, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8,1,9,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Jun,2021

Also, 49 percent of respondents said their clients have asked about cryptocurrencies in the past six months. Of the respondents, 48 percent read the occasional news stories on cryptocurrencies and are somewhat comfortable conversing about the topic, 33 percent actively educate themselves on cryptocurrencies and are comfortable conversing about the topic, and 4 percent say they don't know anything about cryptocurrencies and don't talk about them with their clients.

JFP,Student Loan Planning in Response to COVID-19 and Recent Legislation,"If you speak with any financial, tax, or legal professional, the consensus is usually the same--there has been an overwhelming amount of legislation passed in recent years. In 2017, there was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), arguably the largest tax reform within the past two decades. Two years later, Congress passed the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act (SECURE Act), bringing substantial changes to the employee benefit and retirement space. Then in 2020, the world came to a standstill due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To avoid a crippling and prolonged recession, the US Congress passed three stimulus packages. Altogether, each of the five bills impacts taxpayers in slightly different ways, but they share a high degree of correlation. This includes tax bracket and marginal rate adjustments, revised credits, stimulus checks, and employee benefit and retirement options. Yet despite the numerous legislative changes, there is one area that has gone relatively untouched: student loans.","Johnson, Dan, CFP® EA",0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Jun,2021
JFP,"Learn, Listen, and Lead on Cryptoassets","Ross gets many calls from financial advisers ranging from excitement to rage. Many times, these calls come after advisers have conducted a meeting and learned that their client holds a meaningful position in crypto. Another common occurrence is an adviser learning a client has multimillions in a Coinbase account. In the worst cases, the adviser learns a position accrued massive capital gains, but the client was also being remunerated in a particular crypto. For an unsuspecting adviser who may have been hoping to avoid this ""speculative mania,"" this finding is the rude awakening that crypto is here to stay. Your clients own some, believe it. In fact, the 2021 Trends in Investing Survey, conducted by the Journal of Financial Planning and FPA, and supported by Onramp Invest, found that 15 percent of advisers surveyed currently use or recommend cryptocurrencies with their clients, which is up from less than 1 percent in the 2020 survey. Twenty-six percent of advisers said they plan to increase their use or recommendation of cryptocurrencies in the next year.

But the association also works to educate policymakers and the public on the importance of financial planning through its advocacy work. Here, she admits that she sat down with Patrick and FPA Board President Skip Schweiss to chat about the future of financial planning, how trade associations can influence public policy and why new financial planners should care about advocacy.

JFP,"Understanding the Intersection Between Style Exposure, Sector Rotation, and the Business Cycle","Financial planners and Investors generally tend to evaluate their equity allocation either through the lens of sector exposure or through the lens of style exposure. In reality, these two dimensions are highly related. Using holdings-based style analysis, this research shows that the average funds in the Morningstar large-cap growth and large-cap value categories tend to overweight or underweight certain sectors relative to the broad stock market, while SPDR sector ETFs vary greatly in their exposure to growth and value stocks. Returns-based style analysis based on the Fama-French Three-Factor Model confirms that certain sectors exhibit strong and consistent style biases. Specifically, the technology sector has historically exhibited the strongest growth bias, while the financial sector exhibited the strongest value bias. After introducing a relatively simple definition of the business cycle, authors proceed to analyze the performance of sectors through the different phases of the cycle and demonstrate that certain groups of sectors tend to consistently perform better in specific phases of the cycle. Authors demonstrate how a relatively simple investment strategy that actively rotates between sectors-based on changes in the business cycle-would have consistently and significantly outperformed the broad stock market. Authors then analyze the style characteristics of such a strategy. This paper concludes by showing that the aforementioned strategy, when implemented as a 15 percent satellite to an otherwise passive and broadly diversified portfolio, would significantly improve the risk/return characteristics of the portfolio.","Noble, Carl, CFA;Dillon, Sean, CMT CFTe;Locatelli, Sauro, CFA FRM SCR™;Mento, Dan, CFA;Solow, Ken, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-May,2021
JFP,Transitioning Current Clients to a New Service Model,"As the financial advice industry continues to evolve, Spiller is seeing a steady increase in the different types of services that financial planners offer to their clients. From a business perspective, this allows planners to tailor their services to their unique clientele or offer services that better meet their personal needs and lifestyle goals as a business owner. From a client's perspective, the wide variety of services means they can find a planner who offers exactly what they need. In other words, this change is a ""win"" for firm owners and consumers alike. The biggest shift she's seeing in the financial planning profession is planners pivoting toward a service model that prioritizes their expertise, not tangible deliverables.

JFP,Social Security Claiming Strategies for Singles and Their Implications for Couples,"Here, Reichenstein and Meyer present important insights related to the optimal Social Security claiming age for a single individual. The first section demonstrates that in order to maximize expected real (inflation-adjusted) lifetime Social Security benefits, it is seldom optimal for a single retiree to claim benefits in any month near either of two dates. The first date is 36 months prior to the full retirement age (FRA), while the second date is the FRA. The second section discusses four other factors that the single retiree should consider when selecting their claiming age. Each of these factors should encourage single individuals to delay claiming Social Security beyond this lifetime maximizing age. The report then explains when the lessons from the first section related to maximizing a single retiree's expected real lifetime benefits also apply to the claiming strategy for each partner of a married couple.","Reichenstein, William, PhD CFA;Meyer, William",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-May,2021
JFP,3 Guidelines for a Successful Social Media Strategy,"Social media and its use for financial planning practices are fairly new and it is becoming a must for the field. The newer generation of financial planners seems to be more inclined to adopt social media as a part of their practice. Sprung would argue that every adviser needs to consider adding this component to their firm, whether they are brand new or a 40-year veteran. Social media can be an excellent tool to build relationships and your brand, share your story and essentially drive new business. Traditionally, a firm would look to advertise, produce mailings and conduct seminars--and there are a host of other marketing options available. Social media allows you to cast a wide or narrow net depending on what you are looking to accomplish, while getting immediate results to see how your campaign is performing. Here, Sprung presents 3 guidelines for a successful social media strategy.","Sprung, Lawrence",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-May,2021
JFP,Use Leadership Skills That Apply to Behavioral Economics to Avoid the Sunk Cost Fallacy,"Coach Vince Lombardi exhorted his players, telling them, ""Winners never quit, and quitters never win."" Following this advice in a financial planning practice can lead to costly problems because, sometimes, quitting a project is the best option. Not quitting could result in throwing good money after bad. Practice leaders need to be aware of this possibility and use their leadership skills to avoid this dysfunction or lead their team to the correct change of course. Four elements of behavioral economics--loss aversion, commitment, status quo bias, and people mentally accounting for costs and benefits in silos rather than the aggregate--combine into a powerful force against making the right decision by supporting the attraction of the sunk cost fallacy. While loss aversion is generally about objective investments like money, commitment refers to the decision-maker's perception of how others would view their quitting.","Smith, David F, PhD CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-May,2021

Rebalancing is the act of returning a portfolio to its ""target"" allocation to keep portfolios near an expressed risk preference. Rebalancing is necessary because portfolios drift from targets over time. As an example, an investor who started a 60/40 portfolio in July 2008 and never rebalanced would have more than 75 percent in stocks just 10 years later. This would clearly represent a riskier portfolio than originally implemented. Here, Delorme looks at whether common rebalancing strategies helped portfolio performance and recovery in 2020.

Getting indirectly paid for advice by commissions from selling products has conflicts of interest. And tying fees to asset size by doing a percentage of AUM is illogical and arbitrary as asset size alone is a poor indicator of the time and resources necessary to properly serve clients.

On one such occasion, a dapper financial professional in a suit began soliciting him for business. A great privilege of working with food is that feedback is terse but abundant: if the food sucks, you'll know quickly. This isn't a pleasure enjoyed (often) by financial professionals. They pride themselves in intuiting clients. That said, they are not as good at mindreading as they might think they are or so says a team from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Los Angeles. So, starting a conversation on how clients are affected by an adviser's appearance makes sense. Subtle ways advisers conduct themselves truly matter.

Financial planners advise individuals, couples, families, business owners, and corporations to help them meet their long-term financial objectives. Mediators facilitate dialogue between two or more parties to help them reach an agreement. That is what financial planners and mediators do. But if you consider why clients hire each of these professionals--and also consider the skillset required by both in order to be successful--you will find striking similarities. Clients hire financial planners and mediators for the same reason: to help them identify their goals and design a path to achieve them. In order to best serve their clients, both professionals must fully understand their clients' needs, interests, fears, and priorities. Successful financial planners--just like successful mediators--are experts at connecting with clients and establishing rapport and trust. Here, three cornerstone mediation techniques financial planners can learn and use with clients are offered. Incorporating these powerful communication tools will strengthen your relationships with clients, deepen your insights about who your clients are as you analyze their financial options, and enable you to skillfully facilitate challenging conversations about money.

""This lets you gain energy and height, just like someone jumping on a trampoline."" The first step in becoming a good listener is to have a sense of self-awareness. The second step is to really be present when your clients are talking, and to seek to understand what they are saying. Don't type notes and don't look at your watch or your phone. If you're on Zoom, have them on the screen with your camera, so it doesn't appear as if you're looking at a separate screen and not paying attention. Don't talk when they are talking. Give them cues that you're listening--like nodding your head. Repeat what they've said back to them, so they can confirm you've understood. Ask clarifying questions.

It's no accident that the Financial Planning Association believes in ""elevating the profession that transforms lives through the power of financial planning"". Most clients aren't looking for a financial plan as much as they are looking to see a difference in their lives. The story should also resonate with the listener. As the story unfolds, he or she should feel like it describes them or someone they know. Perhaps they, too, are worried about their finances. Maybe they have a friend or family member that sounds just like the client you are describing. Finally, the story should demonstrate how your care and expertise was instrumental to the change.

JFP,Right-Sizing Retirement: Exploring the Retirement Consumption Gap in Early Retirement,"* Research suggests some households underspend in retirement, resulting in a ""retirement consumption gap."" This paper explores this effect, specifically during the first 10 years of retirement, and incorporates both household assets and preretirement spending using data from the Health and Retirement Study. * Only 18 percent of households have enough wealth to cover pre-retirement consumption when they retire, which suggests most households will not be able to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle in retirement-a finding consistent with other general estimates of the retirement readiness of Americans. * Real financial assets decline for 65 percent of households during the first 10 years of retirement, with a median real decline of 35 percent. * Real retiree spending declines for 75 percent of households during the first 10 years of retirement, with a median annual decline of approximately 2 percent per year. This suggests financial planners should consider changes in retirement spending that are less than inflation as part of a retirement plan. The percentage of households that can fund their retirement consumption increases dramatically during the first 10 years of retirement, from 18 percent to 48 percent, primarily due to reductions in spending. This suggests households ""right-size"" their spending early in retirement to better align with available resources. It is not clear, though, to what extent this behavior persists further into retirement (due to data limitations). Many well-funded households could increase consumption, but appear not to do so (i.e., exhibit a retirement consumption gap). Potential reasons include the desire to leave a bequest, uncertain medical expenses (especially late in retirement), uncertain life expectancy, etc. While this group is a minority of retiree households, understanding what drives this behavior is especially important to financial planners since this group tends to have the most accumulated wealth and are, therefore, more likely to seek the services of, or use, a financial planner.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP;Cormier, Warren",0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,19,1,22,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21-Feb,2021

Yet, human capital, rather than financial capital, is responsible for the bulk of the wealth for most individuals during most stages of their lives, especially during their younger years.

The taxable portion of Social Security benefits depends on a household's Provisional Income (PI). Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is used in several places in the tax code. However, the definition of MAGI varies with each use. For married couples filing jointly, no Social Security benefits are taxable if their PI is below $32,000.

And today, when so many are consumed with 24/7 access to information through various technological mediums, it is the more low-tech areas that can be tapped to help you on this journey. The beauty of our profession is that we see so many of the good and bad situations our clients face.

JFP,Safely Boosting Retirement Income by Harmonizing Drawdown Paths,"Building on Bengen's famous 4 percent rule (Bengen 1994), this paper introduces the DMSWR, a technique for calculating withdrawal rates and retirement income levels that are safe, steady, and adjusted for inflation. The DMSWR (named after the authors' initials, plus the acronym for safe withdrawal rate) addresses two commonly cited shortcomings of the 4 percent rule. First, it addresses the starting point paradox (Kitces 2008) by ensuring that initial retirement incomes are stable regardless of the precise retirement date and short-term fluctuations in the stock market. Second, the DMSWR significantly reduces the risk of unnecessarily low retirement income that leads to large, unspent portfolios at the end retirement. The DMSWR provides withdrawal rates that are often substantially higher, and never lower, than the 4 percent rule, which allows financial planners to recommend higher retirement incomes that are still safe. The core insight underpinning the DMSWR is that a retiree can safely follow the ""drawdown path"" of an earlier retiree who follows the 4 percent rule and planned for a longer retirement.","Marwood, David;Minnen, David, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Nov,2020
JFP,What Does the Decrease in Life Insurance Ownership Mean for Financial Planners?,"Life insurance is an important component of risk management and insurance planning, and is also important in other financial planning issues, including employee benefits, income tax planning, and estate planning. But the importance of life insurance seems to be decreasing in terms of ownership rates, and the relative number of life insurance agents. Also, in the list of principal knowledge topics for the CFP exam, the weight for risk management and insurance decreased from 14 percent to 12 percent. Logistic regression results of the likelihood of three different types of life insurance ownership from the 1992-2016 SCF dataset, controlling for various household characteristics, indicated there was a negative relationship between the survey year and the likelihood of life insurance ownership for any life insurance and cash value life insurance. However, the relationship was not significant for term life insurance ownership.","Kim, Kyoung Tae, PhD;Mountain, Travis P, PhD;Hanna, Sherman D, PhD;Kim, Namhoon, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Nov,2020

At 72 years of age, she's spry, she's fearless, she's the president of a multi-milliondollar family business and she's quietly becoming demented. The saga of the dementing leader is a real-life drama playing out with increasing regularity in executive offices around the country. In farms and finance, in manufacturing and medicine, business owners are living and working longer. As a result, the odds of a leader becoming mentally incapacitated while still 'in the saddle' are rising. This is particularly germane to CFP practitioners on two fronts: many work with business owners who will be experiencing cognitive decline; and many are business owners themselves who will be experiencing decline.

The financial planning profession as a whole has significant talent gaps that can be partially filled with racial, gender, and sexual orientation diversity, but not completely.

JFP,Utilizing What We Know About Tele-Mental Health in Tele- Financial Planning: A Systematic Literature Review,"The coronavirus pandemic expanded the adoption of virtual financial planning, or tele-financial planning practices, as it's referred to in this paper. Unfortunately, limited empirical research on telefinancial planning exists to guide planners through this transition. However, there are similarities between financial planning and counseling; therefore, a systematic literature review on tele-mental health interventions was conducted to provide guidance for financial planning practices and future research. Research suggests the efficacy of tele-mental health is comparable to face-to-face delivery while creating greater efficiency for the therapist and the patient. The breadth and severity of conditions treated suggest that this delivery method is a viable channel, not a convenient stopgap for extraordinary circumstances or lower-value engagements. These findings suggest financial planners might leverage a virtual delivery channel to provide effective recommendations while expanding their reach and providing an experience that is less stressful and more convenient. The operational efficiencies experienced in tele-mental health suggest that financial planners could also improve the efficiency of their practices. Planners should proactively ensure that all clients have the resources and knowledge to engage in a virtual capacity and review their data security measures. For the financial planning profession to advance, practitioners cannot solely rely on research and best practices from related disciplines. Thus, this paper serves as a call for further study on telefinancial planning.","Sensenig, Derek J, CFP®;Walsh, Brian, CFP®;Machiz, Ives, CFP®;Stanley, Nicolas, CFP®;Russell, Matthew;McCoy, Megan, PhD LMFT CFT-I™",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Sep,2020

To better understand how it's changing, let's look at the current state of the Canadian financial services landscape. Canada's population of 37.6 million is spread across 10 provinces and three territories, in the second largest (by landmass) country in the world. Canada has two official languages, English and French, and while most of the country is governed by common law, the province of Quebec follows the civil code. Financial industry regulation in Canada has largely fallen under the purview of the provinces (as they have constitutional jurisdiction over ""property"") and carried out in practice by a handful of inter-provincial selfregulating organizations. This piecemeal approach has meant fragmented securities regulations and has complicated efforts toward financial and securities market reform.","Pereira, Jason, CFP®;Macqueen, Alexandra, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Sep,2020

JFP,The Ripple Effect: Potential Consequences of a Conflict of Interest,"To understand the importance of a conflict of interest in professional practice, a financial planner should understand the potential consequences of a conflict of interest to the client and to the planner. A conflict of interest is an interest a financial planner has or is considering that is likely to interfere with the fiduciary duty the financial planner has to a client, to the extent that the fiduciary duty will not be enacted in the client's best interest. The consequences of a conflict of interest can be visualized through the metaphor of the ripple effect. To be fully understood and appreciated, each of these ripples should be carefully considered. As a result of the life insurance planning John provided for Bill, John recommended that Bill apply for a $5 million life insurance policy for Bill to provide for his family, in the event of an untimely death. John is a licensed life insurance agent and thus recommended to Bill that he complete and file the application.","Bearden, Frank C, PhD, CLU®, ChFC®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Sep,2020

It seems almost every wealth management firm, insurance company, and employee benefit provider is promising to deliver ""financial wellness"" to their respective clients. It is understandable in the new normal of COVID-19 that corporate marketing departments and industry consultants would adopt this language. The term ""financial wellness"" sounds ""healthy,"" and attaching it to a firm's products or services creates the perception that these offerings are endowed with special healing properties. Organizational wellness has both quantitative and qualitative components. It means not only that a person has a good handle on managing and tracking expenses, planning for a major expense, or has adequately prepared for retirement (quantitative component). But good financial management requires having plans in place for both the successful transition of financial decision-making authority in the case of illness or death, as well as the safe and secure transfer of wealth to the next generation.","Heye, Chris, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Sep,2020

JFP,6 Essentials for Building Successful Family Teams,"Kornegay discusses the essentials for building successful family teams. Increasingly, people hear from financial planners who are thinking about or taking initial steps toward bringing a family member into their practice. Some are looking to expand their team to meet the needs of their growing business; others may be more concerned about providing continuity for clients and an exit strategy for themselves. Not surprisingly, for some it's a win-win, but for others it can be a recipe for disaster. Over many years of working with family teams--six essentials for building and maintaining successful family teams are identified. It includes the universal framework for communication, a shared vision for the future, a transformational client experience, a marketing message that leverages the family's strengths, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and a well planned legacy strategy.","Kornegay, Adam;Ursiny, Zach",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Aug,2020
JFP,Understanding How to Make the Best of the Worst of Times,"Follett discusses the importance in understanding how to make the best of the worst of times. Markets rise and fall, but when they fall at an unprecedented rate and then rise just as quickly, it's difficult to make sense of what's going on. These circumstances are further compounded by the fact that many don't know how the drivers of the market--namely, the coronavirus crisis and resulting economic damage--will resolve. Timing the market requires two right decisions: when to leave and when to reenter. People see the cost of missing out on the rebound, but staying invested and disciplined during a historic market correction, global pandemic, and recession--all happening concurrently--is easier said than done. When the Dow posted its five largest daily point losses in history within the span of 10 days, many investors may have felt as if their portfolios were in free fall. The obvious solution was to pull the rip cord and open their parachute. The ensuing panic seemed to overshadow all notions of preparing a proper strategy in advance to achieve as soft a landing as possible, given the unpredictable nature of the market and the idea that what goes up must come down.","Follett, Nick",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Aug,2020
JFP,Navigating Client Relationships During COVID-19,"Brady et al discuss the navigation of client relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are vast, touching multiple areas of people's lives and finances. During volatile times, it is especially important for financial advisers to actively maintain their client relationships. While the pandemic is truly unprecedented, there may be lessons from a recent period of volatility, the financial crisis of 2007--2009, that the financial industry can apply to the current situation. During the upheaval of the crisis, many advisers were able to demonstrate their value and retain clients even as they lost wealth as a result of the downturn. The value of building trust with clients may be especially important for relationships with older clients. Older clients who personally trust their advisers may be more likely to retain their services through stressful life events. Right now, people of all ages are looking for trusted sources of advice to help figure out how to navigate the financial upheaval of the pandemic while still working toward their longer-term plans and goals. One important component of navigating communication and outreach is understanding that clients' life stages and responsibilities may shape the concerns they have related to COVID-19.","Brady, Samantha;Miller, Julie, PhD;Balmuth, Alexa",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Aug,2020

That said, times like these serve as a catalyst to check in, rebalance, and reallocate portfolios, so it is a good time to revisit the discussion on active versus passive, noting there is a broad spectrum of approaches that escape this simple bifurcation of investment ideologies.

JFP,Saving in Roth Accounts and Making Roth Conversions before Retirement in Today's Low Tax Rates,"There is a strong possibility that tax rates will rise in the next few years by more than the tax rate increases that are already scheduled to occur in 2026 according to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And, due to the taxation of Social Security benefits and income-based Medicare premiums, many retirees will have substantially higher marginal tax rates in retirement than their then-current tax brackets. Here, Reichenstein recommends advice financial advisers can provide this year and perhaps the next few years to help clients--especially pre-retirement-age clients--take advantage of what his colleagues and him believe are today's temporarily relatively low tax rates. In the next few years, while tax rates are relatively low, pre-retirement-age investors should consider: (1) saving in tax-exempt accounts like a Roth 401(k) instead of tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k); and (2) making Roth conversions to fill today's relatively low tax brackets.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA",1,1,11,1,12,1,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jul,2020

This research identified the alignment and discordance between what non-retired investors value, and what financial advisers think their clients value. These insights show opportunities for advisers to better articulate their value and, in doing so, improve attraction, retention, and promote client satisfaction. Using an online platform, investors were asked to rank a set of 15 adviser attributes from most important to least important. Advisers were asked to rank the same attributes, predicting what they thought investors valued. Results show that both groups recognized that reaching financial goals is a top priority, with notable disagreements on how to achieve this. Investors underestimated the importance of behavioral coaching in helping them stay on course. Advisers underestimated the importance of tax-efficient strategies to their clients.","Murphy, Ryan O, PhD;Lamas, Samantha;Sin, Ray, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jul,2020

A recent survey by CFP Board revealed that nearly 80% of surveyed CFP® professionals received more inquiries from current clients as the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, while another 34 percent reported an increase in inquiries from prospective clients. These CFP® professionals are filling a critical need by helping their clients to understand what is happening in our economy, avoid panic-driven decisions, and make sound financial choices for themselves and their families. We must be able to meet the demand for personal financial advice at any time, but it is even more crucial in times of crisis.","Keller, Kevin R, CAE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jul,2020
JFP,Combating Systemic Racism in Financial Planning,"June 1 marked the 99th anniversary of the destruction of Black Wall Street in Tulsa OK. With over 300 Black-owned businesses at the time, Tulsa embodied Black success following Reconstruction. The massacre and rioting that resulted in hundreds of deaths, 35 square blocks burned, and over 1,200 homes destroyed,1 was ignited by an elevator encounter between a 19-year-old Black man Dick Rowland and a 17-year-old White girl Sarah Page. Though Page never pressed charges, the rumor circulated that Rowland sexually assaulted her. Sadly, the stimulant that ignited the fire to Tulsa 99 years ago--systemic racism--continues to plague us nearly a century later. Combating systemic racism is not new to us. As a firm, we recognize creating an equitable society requires hard work and dedication. GRID 202 Partners is defined by an unwavering commitment to realize that vision. Supporting the Black community and addressing systemic racism has been, and will always be, a core tenet of GRID 202 Partners.","Beverly, Keith, CFA, CFP®;McDonnough, Kamila, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jul,2020

Cordell's mother, Fran, passed away 13 years ago, but he now realize how many financial planning lessons she taught him long before financial planning was a recognized profession. Mother was the first-born child of two Sicilian immigrants. Her father, Vito Sparacio, came to America by himself at age 19. He first performed manual labor on the railroad, then worked in a shoe shop, then on the production line for the Thomas Edison Co in New Jersey. His mother taught him the importance of saving and hard work to achieve financial goals. Not long after the stock market crash of 1929, his grandparents had saved enough money to buy a bleach bottling plant in Saint Louis. Vito and Millie sold the shop, packed up everything, including four little Sparacios, and motored west.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®, CLU®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jul,2020

The outbreak of COVID-19 has financially affected virtually every person, every company, and every organization across the globe. Even before the current crisis, we know from investor surveys that health- and longevity-related concerns dominate client fears around retirement. In a Merrill Lynch and AgeWave study of older adults, 49% of respondents cited ""a costly health issue"" as their top financial retirement worry. By contrast, only 13% mentioned ""poor stock market returns."" In a 2019 investor survey conducted by Franklin Templeton, health issues were the No. 1 retirement-related concern for adults over age 65. Surveys by Fidelity and other financial service firms showed similar results. Health-related fears always top the list. Now is the perfect time to get ahead of the curve and start talking to clients about preparing for the unavoidable health events that they and other family members will face.","Heye, By Chris, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jul,2020
JFP,Exploring the Financial Planning Decisions Related to Greater Access to Retirement Funds Via the CARES Act,"Tacchino explores the financial planning decisions related to greater access to retirement funds through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the US. In an effort to provide relief from the economic impact of the pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on Mar 27, 2020. The new law temporarily lifts strict rules pertaining to withdrawals from either an employer plan or an IRA, thus granting unprecedented access to these funds. The Act also temporarily opens the door to enhanced loans from an employer-provided retirement plan. Clients are given a window to make elections that may help pay bills that went wanting because of employment interruptions and help them to avoid high interest on credit card debt. Financial planners will be called on to assess the myriad implications that arise from the lenient distribution and loan rules. Here, numerous financial planning decisions that must be evaluated based on the temporary relaxation of the law are highlighted and suggests how planners can add value by steering clients through these issues.","Tacchino, Kenn, JD, LLM",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,20-Jun,2020

As financial professionals we want to do what's best for them and when our ""assumptions"" don't hold up, it's easy to beat ourselves up if the plan goes awry. This shock to the system the two of you have created can destroy even the best of financial plans and possibly damage your relationship with the client. Their confidence in you and your ability to handle the situation can have a negative impact on your continued engagement. A coach's role is to embrace what is and focus our attention on what we want to create. Our main focus is to establish a safe and supportive space for the client to have their full range of emotions and pause to decide how to respond.","Davis, Saundra, APFC FBS",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jun,2020

That statement triggered a slew of memories of some of my former coaches who had barked similar things to me and my teammates during my youth. I have echoed the thought myself as a leader, mentor, parent, and with my clients. I mention this not to relive my glory days (I didn't really have any), but because it is a statement worth referring to as we manage through a true crisis and a nasty market environment. These aspects matter because being prepared does not eliminate all pressure, and unaddressed pressures can lead to poor choices and bad, even devastating results. When I see that someone made a bad financial decision, I can usually trace the problem back to a lack of a plan, a bad plan, abandoning a good plan, implementing a sound plan poorly, or failing to revise a plan as needed.","Moisand, Dan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jun,2020

Not only are they concerned and caring for their own families, they are also concerned and caring for clients (sometimes hundreds of clients), as well as for their team members and their communities.

This rolling storm is not a single wave but several waves with each wave striking fear, loss, grief, and anxiety. These waves are hitting the shores of financial planning firms. The first wave was the coronavirus itself as a global pandemic but local disruptor, or what economists call an exogenous shock. Our challenge is to adapt to these exogenous shocks, acknowledging that the emotional response is greater than just COVID-19 as a global pandemic.

Yet, we tend to focus so much time on the numbers, on return on investment, ROI, when in reality, it is ROP or return on people that will fuel our ultimate outcomes.

Under the PSLF program, borrowers of eligible federal direct loans who have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan, while employed in a full-time public service job, may have the balance of the principal and interest due on the loans forgiven. The PSLF program requires borrowers to possess federal direct loans. These are loans issued under the William D.

The purpose of this research is to investigate whether parents' own student loan balances affect their decision to save for their child(ren)'s college education via tax-advantaged education saving vehicles and if their debt affects their decision to take out loans on behalf of their child(ren) for educational purposes. According to this study, parents who are paying off their own student loan debt are less likely to invest in tax-advantaged accounts for their children's education. For financial planners, this research highlights the importance of advising parents who may have their own student loan debt to start saving in taxadvantaged vehicles early.","Martin, Terrance K, Jr, PhD;Augustin, Lua A V, PhD, CFP®;Ricaldi, Laura C, PhD;Nunez, Jose",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jun,2020

Considering the extreme market volatility and economic uncertainty that dominated the first few months of 2020, it turned out to be a rather opportune period in which to be involved in this type of research. The survey's findings on asset allocation are especially telling: Overall, more than half (56.6 percent) of respondents said they typically reevaluate their asset allocation strategy based on the economy in general, while 51.7% do so based on market volatility. Amid extreme market turmoil, another helpful way to cut through the noise is to start at the beginning. The original target allocation set for an investor is what was determined to be that individual's optimal, long-term asset allocation. A portfolio drifted by market movement is, by definition, suboptimal, being underweight recent losers and overweight recent winners and adding, essentially, a momentum trade to the portfolio.","Hetts, Adam",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Jun,2020

He added that young planners are very good with technical skills, and they can help with social media and get things done. They discover things. They move quickly, and that's good.

In her effort to jumpstart her new career she sat at the feet (well, stood around the conference centers) with some of the top names in the profession and she observed a reoccurring theme. Despite the best efforts of the planner, there were many instances that the client didn't follow the plan. Sitting with a client as they face their financial missteps, shame, and limiting beliefs gives me a sense of purpose that surpasses any experience of finding ""their number."" It didn't take long to figure out that as much as she values comprehensive financial planning, her journey was going to be different.

Charitable giving, like many other industries, has unique jargon and overlapping titles and roles. This column will shed light on these titles so you can learn what various individuals at a charity do and what different kinds of gifting are called in order to best help your philanthropic clients.

JFP,Introducing a Workflow for Advising on College Savings,"As virtual financial planning gains market share, the likelihood planners will work with residents of more than one state will increase. As a result, the timing of Luke Delorme's research is prescient because the differing states' tax rates play a significant role in determining whether to recommend a 529 plan to a client over a taxable investment account. Net gain on investment should be a deciding factor when considering account type and structure for our clients. It seems clear (barring significant extenuating circumstances) that Indianans saving for a future college expense should select a 529 plan as the preferred vehicle because of the state's significant tax credit, which drives a 10-year tax alpha of 4.16% on annual contributions of $3,000.

Under adverse market conditions, the missed opportunity is $33 billion. Under normal market conditions, the primary benefit for most families from using a 529 plan is not its tax advantages; it is the fact that it encourages investing instead of using a savings account. Middle- and upper-middle-class families stand to benefit the most from increased adoption of 529 plans (and other investing vehicles). The average family saving for college would see a benefit of $4,044 per child. The focus of this paper is on the use of 529s for college savings--their intended purpose before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act broadened the allowable purposes of 529s to include K-12 education.

The SECURE Act killed the stretch IRA for beneficiaries (save for beneficiaries who are surviving spouses, chronically ill, or disabled), meaning they will have to withdraw all plan assets within 10 years of the date of the plan owner's death. Those heirs can withdraw the assets over the 10-year period or withdraw it all at 10 years. Previously, the stretch IRA permitted an heir to defer IRA contributions over long periods of time, deferring income tax.

Commitment moves our clients to follow our recommendations and take action, and to make the changes that lead to progress and financial improvements. As much as financial planners may love them, pie charts and Monte Carlo simulations are not a pathway to financial nirvana. The good news is that robo-advisers cannot do what personal financial planners can--that is, help clients connect their money and financial decisions with their unique life, their goals, and their values.

Hannah Moore, CFP®, of Guiding Wealth, recently tweeted, ""The absolute worst part about planners that try to use shame to get clients to change behavior is that a client disappears."" Because the woman in the story had a financial planner before who had shamed her, sending her right into the Zoom meeting with a new planner.

The survey also found that 71% of Americans think people are less confident in each other now than they were 20 years ago. Therefore, the ability to build and maintain high levels of trust in client relationships will be an even more important skill for financial planners over the next decade and beyond.

Culture is commonly defined as a way of life of groups of people, meaning the way they do things--their behaviors, beliefs, values, and symbols that they accept without even thinking about them, that are passed along by communication and imitation. In a commoditized industry, the challenge is not doing business with people who need what you have (that's obvious); rather, it's doing business with people who believe what you believe. Your team members, clients, prospects, and community must know your beliefs and principles; those principles are the foundation of your culture, not merely words with no actions.

They look beyond 401(k)s for a broader set of investment alternatives, and eventually they seek the help of a financial planner who can manage the complexity and scale of their financial needs. Financial planners can help clients and simultaneously protect assets under management by developing a strong relationship with an insurance professional who is experienced in working with financially successful clients and who has excellent relationships with insurers that specialize in high-net-worth clients. Annual risk assessments of new and ongoing exposures are critical, especially for wealthy clients.

JFP,Introducing the Longevity Portfolio,"Annuities with benefit payments linked to inflation (i.e., real annuities) have long been regarded as the optimal financial product for retirees because they provide income that is guaranteed for life and are linked to expected future changes in retiree spending, such as inflation. However, real annuities--as well as virtually all other types of annuities--remain relatively unpopular among retirees today, both in the US and globally, an effect commonly referred to as the ""annuity puzzle."" Funding retirement with a traditional portfolio creates an imperfect hedge, since it subjects the retiree to the possibility of outliving savings, commonly referred to as longevity risk. Investment approaches that explicitly consider the risk structure of a goal (i.e., the liability) are generally referred to as liability-driven investing (LDI). While LDI has become increasingly common among pension plans, it is not widely used when creating household retirement portfolios. One reason for this is that pension liabilities have relatively known payments, while individual expenses can vary significantly.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20-Mar,2020

JFP,The Difference a Day Can Make: Exploring Another Variable of Interest for EIAs,"Academics and practitioners have developed a robust literature examining the suitability and use of equity index annuities (EIAs). EIAs are complex structured products designed to allow investors to limit downside risk while simultaneously participating when equity markets rise, the characteristics of which are not always readily understood. As described by Collins, Lam, and Stampfli (2009), EIAs are ""fiendishly difficult to understand"". They come with myriad contract characteristics, many that can be changed at the behest of the issuer, making meaningful comparisons across products a challenge. As a result, determining the suitability of an EIA as part of an investment portfolio or retirement plan remains a complex task.

Even if someone gets back into the market at a lower price point after exiting, that success encourages further speculations of what the market may do next, resulting in additional bets for bigger and bigger sums of money until being wrong costs dearly. Safe withdrawal rate and portfolio sustainability studies typically assume that portfolios are rebalanced, usually annually, regardless of market behavior. For diversified portfolios, during a bear market, the conventional wisdom seems to be that selling is bad, holding is okay, and rebalancing is better.

When a client knows their adviser takes his or her professional obligations seriously and places ethical principles over personal gain, a good, working partnership can be formed-one that best serves the client's needs. Federal regulations, state laws, and employer policies set a baseline of accountability in personal financial planning. But the setting and enforcement of professional standards provides further client assurances that help grow the trust that exists between a client and their financial adviser.","Keller, Kevin R, CAE",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19-Nov,2019
JFP,College Savers: What Is the Expected Tax Alpha of 529 Plans?,"529 plans offer tax advantages, however they come with more complexity in account set-up, fewer investment options, potentially higher fees, and less flexibility than a taxable account. This research looks at whether the tax advantages provided by 529 plans are too good to pass up. The relative tax advantage of 529 plans also depends on the length of time the client has until college, whether the contributions will be gradual or in a lump sum, and the assumed rate of return on the investments. This analysis calculates a tax alpha on a state-by-state basis as a reference guide for planners who work across many states to help make an initial assessment of whether the 529 plan offers relatively large or small tax advantages versus a taxable account. This can allow a planner to quantify the relative tax benefit of a 529 plan versus a taxable account for college savings, depending on the home state of the client.","Delorme, Luke, CFP®",1,1,9,1,10,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19-Nov,2019

Unlike most professions, ours can actually point to a precise founding date: December 12, 1969, when Loren Dunton convened a group of financial services executives at a Chicago hotel to discuss the possibilities for a new way of delivering financial advice. Out of that gathering came the seeds of what would become FPA and CFP Board. After the Chicago confab, however, there was the possibility of talking to one adviser who could make recommendations that spanned all those silos, melded their possibilities, and offered integrated solutions. Financial planning has always been interdisciplinary and is now expanding to include coaching, facilitation, and financial therapy. Humanistic skills are required if you seek to counsel human beings.

While many seniors have the mental acuity to safeguard their assets, the combination of cognitive decline and accumulated wealth make some other seniors vulnerable to financial crimes. As a financial planner, how can you optimally guide your senior clients, who have diminished financial capacity and decisional abilities, on recognizing the warning signs? Finally, consider consolidating investment accounts, if possible, to make your elderly clients' finances more manageable.

JFP,Lay the Foundation for the Next Generation of Ownership,"Earlier this year, FP Transitions published the Trends in Transactions and Valuations Study, which reviewed valuation data and growth trends for independent financial advisers. One of the most important observations was that firms with a multi-generational ownership structure reported the highest year-over-year revenue growth rate compared to single-owner practices or businesses owned by peers. Firms with multi-generational ownership also showed more diverse client age demographics. In fact, the underlying data supported the conclusion that the single most important investment a growth-minded practice owner can make is to recruit and retain the next generation of advisers. A stepping stone to building a multigenerational business is to create an internship program. FP Transitions has worked with small firms, starting below $1 million in revenue, who used an annual internship as a successful feeder program into their entry-level positions.

JFP,40th Anniversary Highlight: The Question of Conscience,"Limon explores the state of flux when it comes to regulating financial planning. In a winter 1987 article in the Journal of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners, Harold W. Gourgues Jr. and Jeffrey R. Lauterbach wrote that regulation of financial services is in a state of flux. One issue associated with such state of flux has to do with defining financial planning and the second issue is determining whether financial planning is indeed a profession. Chief financial planner Charles G. Hughes argued in a 1988 article that it is neither a lack of definition for financial planning nor a lack of being considered a profession that posed a problem, rather it was a lack of financial planning having a conscience. Hughes defined a conscience as the knowledge or the feeling about right and wrong.","Limón, Ana Trujillo",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19-Sep,2019

JFP,Who Is Investing in ETFs? Exploring the Role of Investor Knowledge,"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are registered investment vehicles ranging in design from tracking an index, commodity, investment style, or non-US market to providing exposure to particular industries or investment vehicles. Investing in an ETF product rather than a mutual fund product offers a number of benefits; the most notable being lower capital gain tax payments, lower fees, and improved liquidity. ETF investors should expect to pay lower capital gain tax payments than mutual funds, given their trading structure. In addition, ETF investors should expect to pay lower fees since accounting costs are determined at the shareholder level, rather than fund level. ETFs do not have load fees, and ETFs do not have 12b-1 fees. And ETFs provide investors an additional liquidity benefit, because ETFs share prices allow for intraday values, whereas mutual funds are only priced once-per-day at their net asset value.

As the profession evolved, so did the Money and Soul column.

In a Sep 2004 Money and Soul column, Courtney Pullen, building on concepts first suggested by Wagner, introduced planners to ""integral finance"" by proposing that planners apply psychology expert Ken Wilber's ""theory of everything"" to the planning process.

JFP,Goals-Based Financial Planning: How Simple Lists Can Overcome Cognitive Blind Spots,"Identifying investment goals is a critical step in developing a sound financial plan that helps investors reach their objectives. Studies have found that using a goals-based framework in financial planning can lead to an increase in wealth for investors and has the potential to strengthen planner-client relationships. As such, more planning professionals are practicing goals-based or goals-centric financial planning. The success of goals-based planning hinges upon two important steps: eliciting goals that are most important to investors; and prioritizing those goals. Yet, behavioral biases may manifest and undermine the efficacy of goal-based financial planning.

It created a new deduction for taxpayers with qualified business income (QBI). Often, but not always, it grants a 20 percent deduction for such taxpayers. This new deduction, however, is phased out for specified service trades or businesses (SSTBs), generally professional service businesses, based on the individual owner's taxable income.

In fact, the total market capitalization of all cryptoassets as of April 2019 is only $180 billion, which makes the coverage that cryptos receive from the financial press overblown relative to other investment options financial planners might consider for client portfolios. Even at the height of crypto-mania in Jan 2018, when prices skyrocketed to all-time highs shortly after bitcoin futures trading began the month prior, the total market capitalization of all cryptoassets combined was still less than Apple's market cap.

This is a convenient way for financial planners to describe the investing experience to clients, and it's partially responsible for the belief that the best way to diversify an investment portfolio is to use an allocation split between stocks and bonds. However, labeling markets as either bull or bear may be an oversimplification of financial market realities.

Hundreds of mutual funds now carry some sort of SRI label, but many of these funds are socially conscious in name only. This study reveals the correlation between Morningstar's GLOBE-denoted sustainability rating and its star rating, which provides an estimation of the relative investment performance of these selections. Risk-adjusted return measures and sustainability metrics were found to be uncorrelated. Self-proclaimed socially responsible funds (SPSRFs) do not materially differ from non-SPSRFs in terms of their sustainability measures or return performance. Within the sustainability funds universe, it is possible to earn better returns by simply avoiding those funds with higher expense ratios. Investors should be aware that about 20 percent of SPSRFs don't live up to their self-proclamation. Furthermore, both SPSRFs and non-SPSRFs with lower expense ratios have higher Morningstar star ratings.

Indeed, a growing body of theoretical research has noted the potential value of financial advisers in a variety of domains; however empirical evidence on the topic is mixed and generally suggests households with financial advisers do no better (or even worse) than those without, especially in investment-related domains.

That doesn't mean, however, that they want or deserve unnecessary financial stress, exorbitant debt, or to default on their mortgage. No reasonable person, however saintly, wants that. Furthermore, student loans are just a piece of the financial anxiety puzzle for millennials working in public service.

Since the last severe economic recession in 2008-2009, the US economy has experienced an unprecedented period of growth. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 have more than quadrupled in value since 2009 lows, leading to the longest period of continuous market growth in US history.

In other words, on average they pay out less than the amount of the bet. How much less they're willing to pay out is dependent on competitive pressures, marketing, and advertising, like dancing fountains and flaming artificial volcanos.

Reverse mentoring is easy to implement. The concept is structured so that a senior and junior member (not necessarily from the same organizational group) meet regularly for a planned discussion. Each meeting has an agenda set by the junior member. If the pair is having a hard time coming up with discussion topics, they can adopt a business case to solve together.

JFP,Investigating the Role of Whole Life Insurance in a Lifetime Financial Plan,"Financial advisers with an investment emphasis may commonly suggest that pre-retirement life insurance needs are best met by using a ""buy term and invest the difference"" strategy that pays the smallest premiums for a temporary death benefit, allowing more assets to be invested. Investments, however, may not be ideally suited for managing the full range of post-retirement financial risks, including longevity risk, market volatility, and spending shocks. This study considers whole life insurance as an alternative to ""buy term and invest the difference"" as part of a lifetime financial plan. Three possible uses of whole life insurance in a lifetime financial plan for a hypothetical couple, both age 40, are investigated. The analyses suggest that integrating whole life insurance into a lifetime financial plan has the potential to allow a given asset base to support greater lifetime spending and greater legacy than ""buy term and invest the difference"" strategies.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19-Feb,2019

But when it comes to helping your clients maximize college financial aid for their children, it can be used to their advantage.

Unfortunately, at $25,000 per year for many in-state public institutions to $50,000 a year or more at private institutions, a four-year education can approximate that of a small starter house. Multiply that by two or three kids, and the cost approximates that of a very nice house.

JFP,FAFSA Facts,"A few important issues are frequently faced by financial planners who help their clients fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Most of these issues center on conflicts between tax and financial aid optimization of a family's finances. Examples include the treatment of divorced and separated parents, and the treatment of grandparent-owned 529 college savings plans. This article will explore these topics and provide financial planners tips for ensuring the FAFSA is completed correctly. When a dependent student's parents are divorced or separated, only one parent is responsible for completing the FAFSA. The FAFSA treats legal and informal separation the same as divorce. When married parents claim head of household status on their federal tax returns, it is almost always incorrect. The IRS might not enforce it, but college financial aid administrators will.","Kantrowitz, Mark",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19-Feb,2019

Given equity market behavior since then, this is prescient and offers an opportunity to review some key aspects of retirement income planning that now seem especially relevant. Any approach balancing the priorities of lifetime sustainability and maximum income generation must successfully navigate challenging market conditions at various times, likely both early and later in retirement. We all know this, of course, but I've learned that we can't remind clients of such things too often.

JFP,Retirement Income Literacy: A Key to Sustainable Retirement Planning,"In 2014, the first iteration of the RICP Retirement Income Literacy Survey was used to test the retirement income literacy of Americans nearing or already in retirement. The initial data found the mean respondent score was 17.12 correct out of 38 questions, or an average score of 45% (Hopkins and Littell 2016). In 2017, the survey was re-run with new respondents and yielded similar results: retirement-age Americans (ages 60-75) had the same low rate of retirement income literacy as they did three years prior. Some areas of knowledge showed slight improvement; however, only 26% of retirement-age Americans passed the literacy quiz with a score of 60% or higher, indicating a lack of retirement income planning knowledge. This paper takes the 2017 retirement income literacy data a step further by analyzing the impact that retirement income literacy has on retirement income planning decisions, measurements of financial security, and retirement satisfaction.","Hopkins, Jamie P, JD, LLM, RICP®, CFP®, ChFC®, CLU®;Pearce, John A, II, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,11,1,13,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,19-Jan,2019

First, for cash contributions, the prior-law 50% of adjusted gross income (AGI) limitation on deductible charitable contributions for the current year increased to 60 percent of AGI from 2018 through 2025. Although tax savings is not the primary reason many taxpayers make charitable contributions, changes made by the TCJA may still have an adverse effect on charitable giving. Generally, to receive a tax deduction for charitable giving, an individual must itemize deductions. From 2018 through 2025, the Tax Policy Center projects nine out of 10 individuals will claim the standard deduction, thanks to the new $12,000 standard deduction, the elimination of miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor, and the state and local tax deduction cap of $10,000.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP®;Brannon, John, CFP®, CTP",0,0,8,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,18-Dec,2018

As we begin our discussion of the brain is it applies to investing, I'd like you to remember three important truths about the brain by visualizing a tweed-clad septuagenarian in line at a steak buffet at 4 PM. Just like the person you've imagined, your brain is old, hungry, and impatient. Our brains have remained relatively stagnant over the last 150,000 years, but the complexity of the world in which they operate has exponentiated. Formal markets like our stock market are just about 400 years old. One consequence of our old equipment is that the brain can end up doing double duty, with primitive structures tasked with parsing risk and reward now charged with a job foreign to their design.","Crosby, Daniel, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Dec,2018

JFP,Future Trends: Generational Realities and the Growth of Our Profession,"Year 2018 marked 45 years since 35 men and women graduated as the first class from the College for Financial Planning. These pioneering Certified Financial Planners led the way, nurturing the growth of a now global profession. They were members of the traditionalist generation, born before 1946, or the baby boomer generation, born between 1946 and 1964. Of those who founded or joined practices in the 1970s and early 1980s, some have passed away, some are retired, and many are on the cusp of transition. As the ownership and employee base ages, succession and continuity planning are a ""front-of-mind"" imperative. Gen-Xers have been the successors, by and large, to boomer owners, and Gen Y is being groomed as successors to the successors. Older financial planners are urged to cultivate younger clients who are destined to grow into the wealthier clients of tomorrow. According to mature market marketing consultants, Immersion Active, there are roughly 74.9 million baby boomers in America.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP®, CRC®, CEPA®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,18-Dec,2018
JFP,Understanding Social Security Claiming Decisions Using Survey Evidence,"Although research shows that there are large gains in lifetime wealth from delaying Social Security claiming, most people claim at or before full retirement age. An original, nationally representative survey was fielded to gain insight into people's rationales for their Social Security claiming decisions, their satisfaction with their past claiming decisions, and how they financed any gap between retirement and claiming. Common rationales for claiming Social Security before full retirement age included stopping work, liquidity, poor health, and concerns about future benefit cuts due to policy changes. Claiming upon stopping work and claiming at full retirement age appeared to be viewed as social norms. Individuals who claimed at full retirement age were more satisfied with their claiming decisions than individuals who claimed early or delayed. There was little evidence that claiming decisions and rationales for claiming were correlated with financial literacy or knowledge of Social Security rules.","Shoven, John B, PhD;Slavov, Sita Nataraj, PhD;Wise, David A, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Nov,2018

JFP,A Road Map to Estate Planning after Tax Reform,"The Tax Cuts and Job Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, is complex and impacts numerous tax specializations, including individual, corporate, and international planning. Of course, estate planning has also been impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Although transfer tax changes made by tax reform are few, the doubling of the exclusion amount with a sunset will significantly affect estate planning for the next eight years. In 2026, the basic exclusion amount reverts to the 2017 amount of approximately $5.49 million, adjusted for inflation between now and then using the slower, newly enacted chained-CPI approach. In other words, the donor's holding period for and income tax basis in gifted property generally carry over to the donee, and the decedent's income tax basis in property passed to heirs steps up or down to the property's value on the date of death or the alternate valuation date six months later.

JFP,Why Every Planner Needs to Understand the New Tax Laws,"Signed into law within the last year, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is still hot off the presses, and the changes are seismic. Never has it been so important for financial planners to incorporate a review of their client's tax return into the planning process. Almost every recommendation made has the potential to swing tax results for better or worse; and being strategic is critical as the nuances of the TCJA become more familiar. Alimony is changing. Under the old laws, the payor of alimony could deduct payments from their income tax return. Recipients would in turn report that income on their tax return. This income was treated like earned income for the purpose of contributing to an IRA. Deductions for charitable donations may no longer benefit those not itemizing. Be aware that anyone receiving a required minimum distribution can divert all or a portion of that distribution directly to the charity.","Wenger, Julia Brufke, CFP®, ChFC®, EA",1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Nov,2018

JFP,Annuitized Income and Optimal Equity Allocation,Prior studies have confirmed that annuitized income such as Social Security or a pension increases the optimal stock allocation of a household's investment portfolio. Buying an income annuity should change the optimal allocation of the remaining investment portfolio. This analysis helps advisers understand how much the remaining equity allocation should change when an annuity is purchased. This paper used current annuity and bond prices to estimate the optimal equity allocation for retirees with varying levels of guaranteed income who have higher and lower preference for income stability and bequests. Results indicate that increasing annuitized income has a strong impact on optimal equity allocation in the remaining investment portfolio. Results suggest that advisers considering recommending the purchase of an income annuity should primarily draw from bond assets to maintain an appropriate risk level for the investor's total wealth.,"Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®;Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Nov,2018

Either as an employee or as a self-employed person, a home office can provide convenience, flexibility, and a lower overhead. In addition to skipping the daily commute, a tax deduction has been available for working from home in the way of the home office expense. However, the home office deduction is eliminated under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), because miscellaneous itemized deductions have been axed. To make up for significant cuts to deductions, the TCJA doubled the standard deduction available to individuals: $24,000 for married couples filing jointly; $12,000 for single filers; and $18,000 for those qualifying for head of household status in 2018. Generally, the only expenses you can deduct for your home are interest and real estate taxes.

JFP,Realizing the Essential Leadership Role of a Financial Life Planner,"Financial life planning is at its best and most effective when a planner facilitates a defined process on behalf of a motivated and fully engaged client. However, before the client reaches the level of trust and comfort needed for a high-quality engagement, he or she instinctually assumes, ascribes, and expects a certain set of traits and behaviors from the planner. Those client assumptions are based on a range of factors tied to the client's personal history and to the many potential roles that can be filled by a financial life planner. Based on that perspective and recent research1, recognizing the leadership role and its accompanying responsibilities is a major step toward creating better financial planners and more effective and impactful planning engagements. Understanding the leadership requirements inherent in a financial planning engagement provides a basis by which planners can personally benchmark their leadership capabilities. With that knowledge, planners can endeavor to improve their leadership capabilities and increase their effectiveness.","Brody, Stephen C, CFP®, ChFC®, RLP®, EdD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Nov,2018
JFP,How Can You Create a More Inclusive Profession?,"AS consumers demand for financial advice grows, it is imperative that the financial planning profession work toward expanding and diversifying the ranks of financial planning professionals who can meet the needs of increasingly diverse consumers. However, today fewer than 3.5% of the more than 82,000 CFP professionals in the US are Black or Latino, which is significantly less than the percentage of those groups in the total US population. The financial planning profession will not be relevant if it does not reflect the diversity of the public it will serve in the future. The summit started by acknowledging that the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the financial planning profession is a significant challenge we need to address. The findings highlighted in the thought leadership paper shed light on three opportunities to boost racial and ethnic diversity in the financial planning profession: increasing mentoring programs, introducing the profession to students earlier in the education path, and boosting awareness of the career.","Mohrman-Gillis, Marilyn",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Nov,2018
JFP,Expand Your Definition of Ownership,"In the last five years, hundreds of financial professionals have taken a different approach to advancing their careers and become minority owners in existing businesses. Despite this, founders and successors alike may hold biases that cause them to overlook suitable candidates and sound opportunities. How one defines ownership frames the assumptions they make when envisioning the path forward: some next-generation advisers are doggedly determined to relive the experience of the early founders in order to prove their mettle; others rule out ownership because they don't want the headache of running a business. Taking a limited view can block viable possibilities. Expanding your definition of ownership can open your path forward -- and be the key that solves the succession problem. At MiyeWire LLC, a boutique planning firm in Reston, VA, ownership means formalizing a shared goal and identity.

Females are, in short, an economic powerhouse. In the US alone, females exercise decision-making control over $11.2 trillion, and nearly half of that purse -- $5.1 trillion -- is managed solely by females. Females represent an untapped opportunity; 53% do not have a financial adviser, and 67% feel misunderstood by their financial adviser. Recognizing this gap, many financial services companies, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Prudential Financial, and TD Ameritrade, are studying the investment behavior of women in hopes of acquiring these important investors as new clients. Additionally, many industry organizations have launched efforts to attract more females into the adviser profession.

The alternative to DCA is lumpsum investing -- investing the entire amount in stocks today. Both logic and simulations indicate that investors are more likely to increase their wealth with lump-sum investing than with DCA, yet the practice of DCA persists. DCA is popular among investors, yet puzzling to justify within standard finance that describes investors as rational. The solution to the puzzle is in behavioral finance that describes investors as normal. The solution combines wants for utilitarian, expressive, and emotional benefits; the application of expected utility and prospect theories; the roles of cognitive and emotional shortcuts and errors; and tools for correcting errors.","Statman, Meir, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Oct,2018
JFP,Mining the Gold That Is Your Introvert Employee,"Ii is estimated that fully 50% of the working population in the US is somewhat to highly introverted. This means that it is possible that half of the valuable employees at a financial planning firm prefer to not be on committees, prefer to not go to conferences, prefer to work alone, prefer to think about ideas for quite a while, and prefer to avoid conflict, especially in groups. Introversion can be confused with shyness; it is not shyness. Introversion is a person's preferred style of working with ideas, people, and the world. Shyness is an anxiety challenge. It's likely that in planning firms you will find greater than 50% introverts, as the financial planning community naturally attracts people with these preferences. This presents leadership challenges. To improve group performance, leaders must focus on the one-on-one relationship with each team member.

Emotional intelligence in both leaders and in new hires is key in keeping the financial planning profession one of high-quality client-first service, especially in an age where technology will only become more prevalent.

In Israel, as in other countries with a strong Socialist tradition, higher education is heavily subsidized, and there is universal medical coverage demanding little financial outlay from individuals. Therefore, typical American upper-middle class parents, who usually don't get financial aid, are facing an education expense of $100,000 to $200,000 per child, while the Israeli parents' cost is nominal.","Goodman, Marina, CFP®, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Oct,2018

For example, we try to minimize taxes to save more money, then use that money to protect our clients with insurance and invest to get to retirement. Yet, it appears that some of us have been employing a strong link strategy.

JFP,"Steve Vernon on the Second Middle Age, Social Portfolio, and Retirement","In an interview, Steve Vernon, FSA, talked about second middle age, social portfolio, and retirement. According to Vernon, he has studied retirement all his professional life. At the beginning of his career, he was helping employers manage their retirement programs to comply with laws and regulations; he really didn't think of its effect on people's lives. But as he reached his 40s and 50s, he was more aware of the significance that retirement takes on for people and how it affects their lives, and he was getting older, so he started thinking about it personally. In my 40s and 50s and now 60s, he has been really interested in helping people with this transition out of the workforce and into retirement. He thinks the most challenging aspects of retirement are in decision-making -- how to help people make more effective decisions. Also, how people can blend working with retirement.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Oct,2018
JFP,Planning for Conflict in Client Relationships,"Professionals use conflict resolution techniques in a variety of contexts to define the issues that underlie disagreements, generate alternative solutions to those issues, and reach resolutions. This paper demonstrates how conflict resolution techniques are applicable to financial planning practice and how these techniques can help clients set meaningful goals and increase the chance of successful plan implementation. All clients (single or coupled) operate in a complex social system where financial conflict has potential to arise with their spouse, parents, children, siblings, friends, and/or coworkers. Financial planners are not currently required to procure a conflict resolution skill set even though addressing and resolving financial conflict is a necessary part of financial planning practice. Essential communication skills for conflict resolution include developing empathy, reframing, reflective listening, and assertive messaging. These skills can help the financial planner navigate common client responses to financial conflict.","Asebedo, Sarah D, PhD, CFP®;Purdon, Emily, CFP®, EA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Oct,2018

Such a period of care is often very stressful for clients and their families; that stress can impede planning and the ability to make good decisions.

And sabbaticals aren't just for academics anymore. Intel and Motley Fool are just two companies providing their employees with this much-needed benefit. McDonald's began its sabbatical program in 1977.

JFP,Revisiting the 15-Year Mortgage as an Investment,"When purchasing a home, 88% of homebuyers in the US finance the purchase with a mortgage, according to the National Association of Realtors. The choice on which loan is best for each buyer may be determined by a variety of factors, such as affordability, expected length of time in the home, expectations about future interest rates, and risk preferences. Given the 33.1% of expenditures spent on housing among homeowners with mortgages, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, mortgage choice matters for the long-run wealth of homebuyers. Currently, the most common mortgage is the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Prior research found that the 30-year mortgage is often better given a 30-year investment horizon, however this analysis found the opposite was true. This paper deviated from the prior work on investment horizon and strategy. This paper revisited the comparison between those two options, but also considered that most homebuyers do not remain in their homes with the same mortgage for the full 30 years.","Farrell, James, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Sep,2018

As just one example, CFP Board's Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct, effective Oct 1, 2019, under Duties Owed to Clients, has Section 5 dedicated to disclosing and managing conflicts of interest. To gain an understanding of this, we should start with consideration of a common conflict, the kind we experience every day, and then consider how a conflict of interest is different. This will help us understand why conflicts of interest are important and should be avoided in professional practice if possible. A common conflict is a personal interest that periodically distracts us from our focus when exercising professional judgment on behalf of a client. The second type of risk relates directly to the financial planner, when he compromises his professional integrity in failing to exercise his best professional judgment.","Bearden, Frank, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Sep,2018
JFP,Your Clients Won't Run Out of Money. Now What?,"There are only two amounts of money: less-than-you-need and more-than-you-need. Over the years, I've often used this statement as an introductory framing for various client conversations. Our financial planning profession is increasingly good at putting people on a path to the latter, and that's all the more likely the better you've been at comprehensive and holistic financial planning. Research by the Center for Retirement Research and, more recently, David Blanchett validates what common sense has always told us: spending for even moderately affluent retirees declines in real terms over time. And this real decrease can approach 30 percent for retirees spending $100,000 or more annually from their mid-1960s to their mid-1980s. Furthermore, when retirees hold off withdrawing Roth IRA assets and gradually transition unneeded IRA required minimum distributions to post-tax brokerage accounts (with their eventual basis step-up), the tax impact can turbocharge this cross-generational transfer.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Sep,2018
JFP,The Impact of Retirement Age Uncertainty on Retirement Outcomes,"A growing body of research notes that retirement age projections are inconsistent with actual retirement age decisions -- people tend to retire earlier than expected. Retiring early can have a significantly negative impact on a retiree's likelihood of meeting his or her retirement income goal by reducing the time for saving and investing, lowering the potential Social Security benefit, and potentially extending the retirement period (assuming the decision to retire early is independent from any kind of health shock). This paper explores the extent to which certain variables can help predict early (or late) retirement; it also explores the implications of early retirement on required savings levels. Few of the variables considered for the analysis have statistically significant coefficients, which suggests there is a significant amount of uncertainty (i.e., randomness) associated with the decision to retire early. One variable, though -- expected age of retirement -- drove the majority of the predictive effect of the model.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,7,1,9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Sep,2018

JFP,6 Steps to Harnessing the Power of Empathy,"Empathy is being aware of and sharing another person's emotions and experiences. Listening with empathy means caring more about what someone is saying and feeling than what you want them to hear. It's a critical skill for financial planners. Empathetic planners feel their client's pain and respond accordingly. Without empathy, it's difficult to establish the emotional connection necessary to build trust in advisory relationships. Those who understand the feelings behind their client's story do more than provide financial solutions; they build confidence. Empathy isn't built without listening. You can harness its power in advisory relationships by listening well. Here are six ways to do it: 1. Give your undivided attention. 2. Learn non-verbal cues. 3. Ask the right questions. 4. Make a connection. 5. Don't be afraid of silence. 6. Follow up soon.","Cheng, Marguerita, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Sep,2018

Perceptions of retirement were generally positive, and a sense of optimism was evident across different segments. Some demographic differences were found in thoughts on life after career. For example, people making less than $25,000 a year used fewer positive words and more negative words; younger adults' images were more likely to address financial well-being; and older adults and those with higher incomes provided more images related to travel.

This paper explains the ""tax torpedo,"" which refers to the sharp rise and then sharp fall in marginal tax rates caused by the taxation of Social Security benefits. For many middle-income households, this tax torpedo causes their marginal tax rate within a wide range of income to be 150% or 185% of their tax bracket. This paper also provides 2018 income ranges within which the tax torpedo likely will apply for both singles and married couples filing jointly.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA;Meyer, William",1,1,9,1,10,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Jul,2018

He believed that a good planner could help anyone at any time with any challenge, and he was energized by the variety of challenges he faced as a financial planner. Financial planners often ask if it would be better to position themselves as someone who does financial planning as a generalist or as someone who specializes in a specific area of financial planning. Many new planners begin their career as generalists, later developing areas of specialization based on the clients they tend to attract or their own background or area of interest. There are three key reasons for developing a niche market: 1. It provides you with a clear focus for your marketing efforts. 2. It gives you a sense of identity as a recognized expert in a specific area. 3.

Perhaps it goes without saying that having team members get better at what they do leads to excellence, but there is much more to ""improvement"" than job excellence. A leader who pays attention to the needs for improvement within their organization should also pay attention to the desires of the team members for self-improvement. Organizational development researchers call this ""improvement behavior,"" which strengthens the trust relationship between the leader and the team member. This relationship quality is called the ""leader-member exchange,"" or LMX, in academic literature. LMX is a crucial concept in understanding how leaders get things done through their team members. LMX develops one team member at a time with the leader.

Whatever the reason, I believe that the firms that can transition ownership to the next generation will thrive, empowering and engaging the future of our profession. At the time I joined RTD Financial, we had six owners, which in and of itself, signified opportunity.

To reduce the cost of medical care using HSAs, it's imperative to understand the rules around them. HSAs are similar to individual retirement accounts for medical expenses. Both individuals and employers can contribute to HSAs for eligible individuals. HSAs are funded with pre-tax dollars, and distributions are tax-exempt if used for qualifying medical expenses. Like an IRA, HSA funds do not have to be spent in a calendar year and can be carried over in the plan balance indefinitely. If a person is eligible, he or she can make deductible contributions to an HSA that is administered by a financial institution or insurance company. To be eligible for an HSA, a person must meet several conditions. First, he or she must be covered under a high-deductible health insurance plan.","Welch, Julie A, CPA, CFP®, PFP;Smith, Cara L, CPA, CFP®",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Jul,2018

The consumer relies on the expertise and professional judgment of a financial adviser when delegating these research activities. However, consumers may not be aware of the level of competence of their financial advisers. To make more informed decisions about the advisers they want to hire, consumers rely on signals that advisers provide, such as their financial designations. The question remains: do consumers value financial services received from credentialed advisers more than the services received from non-credentialed advisers? In this paper, the theoretical models of agency theory and signal theory were used to answer this question. Agency theory was used to test if consumers were willing to incur higher bonding costs in order to lower monitoring costs. Signal theory was tested to determine if there was weight to the signal (professional designation), and if consumers were willing to pay more for a credentialed adviser.","Raskie, Sterling, PhD, CFP®, EA;Martin, Jason, PhD;Lemoine, Craig, PhD, CFP®;Cummings, Benjamin F, PhD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Jun,2018

These historical scenarios, which reflect year-to-year changes in such factors as mortgage rates and investment returns, show that home ownership has not always been the best financial decision for a family.","Cox, Arthur, PhD;Foltowill, Richard, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-May,2018
JFP,Does Your Advice Stick?: Anticipate non-adherence and learn strategies for giving advice that clients will follow,"One of the challenges you face as a financial adviser is how to work with the financial equivalent of live electrical wires. Helping people do sensible things with their money is just as hard as getting people to do the right things their health. As a result, financial professionals can feel like the spoilsports at the party of life, urging prudence and moderation while the fun guys are rolling out the kegs of beer and trays of nachos. Commit to implementing one or more of the following strategies: 1. Educate your team about non-adherence. 2. Record every instance of non-adherence that you and your team encounter. 3. Strive to make your interviews and client materials as free of professional jargon as possible. 4. Aim for shorter meetings. 5. Do not assume clients have understood the critical aspects of what you discussed together; rather, ensure they have understood them. 6. Do not warmth audit of your team.","Somers, Moira, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-May,2018
JFP,Clients' Perceptions of Their Financial Futures Predict Choices,"This study examined the relationship between perceptions of financial future and intertemporal choice by using a new psychological framework -- the future self-continuity framework -- to investigate intertemporal choices. Intertemporal choice is largely based on the concept of temporal discounting. Some individuals can delay immediate gratification with their money for a better financial future. Others prefer immediate gratification, which comes at a cost to their future financial well-being. Regression results suggest that perceptions about financial future predict ability to delay gratification. In particular, perceptions about similarity to a person's financial future and positivity about the performance of the economy may dictate whether clients are willing to delay gratification and save for their future. Results also provide evidence that the ability to visualize their financial future and the details of financial goals influence individuals' willingness to delay gratification. Financial planners can use the results of this study to help clients feel connected with their financial future.","Zepp, Phillip P;Heckman, Stuart J, CFP® PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-May,2018

Less than a third report having a formal succession plan, according to the latest research from FPA and Janus Henderson. This is concerning for many reasons. A lack of a plan makes it less likely that advisers will achieve their retirement goals, causes stress for their teams, and may negatively impact clients. Advisers and the teams surveyed cited finding the right person as the most common barrier to creating a succession plan. In my experience with Janus Henderson Labs and by researching the industry and coaching thousands of advisers for the greater part of two decades, I understand why they'd falter at this stage: most have deep financial and emotional ties to their practices.","Futterman, Michael",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-May,2018

If you have a tracker like a Fitbit and its Aria smart scale, you can track your weight data on the Fitbit app. You observe weight trends, and your journal can inform you of what emotions trigger overeating. Tracking what you eat also informs you of which foods cause spikes in your weight and which foods are good for weight loss.

One would think that a plan so perfect, so on target, is sure to result in the client achieving their best life, unless it doesn't. Financial planners can use coaching skills to bridge the gap between the financial plan and the client's actions. I joined the financial planning profession in 2004 as a mid-life career changer from the non-profit sector. I found this profession life changing as I learned how money works and how creating a comprehensive plan could be life changing for clients.

In many cases, psychology alone is being mislabeled as behavioral economics, and as a result, there are a lot of new experts emerging who ignore the power of the economics toolkit. His only guidance is that in this fusion food they call behavioral economics, you need to look at the label and understand what you are eating of being fed; the economics part is important and essential, because it brings a level of rigor and precision, and that can be lost if you are only using psychology. Now, loss aversion will be taking this exact exercise, but instead of looking at it in the domain of gaining money, let's look at it in the domain of losing money.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-May,2018

The US Census expects minorities to become majorities, projecting they will comprise 57% of the population by 2060. Therefore, it is increasingly imperative for financial planning firms to hire and retain professionals who reflect this growing demographic. From a client perspective, many times talking with a financial planning professional who looks like you and who can relate to you, can make someone more likely to work with a planner.

The thrill of a bona fide deal is dampened by the realization that the seller now must navigate a bewildering array of divergent professional and personal agendas, transaction details and tax and non-tax consequences. A healthy income statement for a closely held business coupled with a robust industry sector and a competitive bidding process can significantly drive up the price of business interests in the 12 to 14 months prior to the ultimate sale.

In my 2017 book, Finance for Normal People, I presented the second generation of behavioral finance that describes investors, and people more generally, as ""normal"", and offers behavioral finance as unified structure that incorporates parts of standard finance, replaces others, and includes bridges between theory, evidence and practice.

JFP,The Financial Implications of Cohabitation Among Young Adults,"Cohabitation is a common path to marriage for many millennials, with two-thirds of couples living with a significant other at least once before marriage. By delaying or opting out of marriage in early years, couples may be less financially prepared for retirement in later years. Previous research has found that men and women who have consumer debt are more likely to begin cohabitating with their significant other, yet combining consumer debt is associated with a higher risk of relationship dissolution. In contrast, buying a home with one's partner was associated in this study with a higher likelihood of transitioning to marriage, likely because of the higher entry and exit costs of the purchase. This study's findings indicate that cohabiters have lower net worth and financial asset accumulation than married respondents, but repeat cohabiters and married respondents with previous cohabiting unions have no less non-financial assets than married respondents who have never cohabited. Younger clients who have cohabited many times may be less interested in long-term planning and more interested in current consumption in the form of non-financial assets; whereas clients who are not cohabiting or cohabiting for the first time with a long-term partner might be more future-oriented with their financial planning.","Britt-Lutter, Sonya, PhD, CFP®;Dorius, Cassandra, PhD;Lawson, Derek, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Apr,2018

Net worth, income, education, years of work experience, and the use of professional advisers were positively associated with business ownership. And among business owners, net worth and a financial sophistication factor were positively associated with incorporation.

Although you have your clients' best interests at heart, and clients want you to have their best interests at heart, sometimes emotions and mistakes get in the way. The Kiplinger article argued that computers -- like humans -- can make mistakes, but the human adviser coupled with a robo-adviser is the best solution.

In pursuit of learning more about how to intentionally bring about such a transformational experience, I interviewed 25 leading financial life planning experts and trainers about their experiences and perceptions of the role spirituality plays in the practice and profession of FLP.

For example, one rule of thumb is that the amount of life insurance needed is seven to 10 times annual income. Sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes it doesn't. Even when it works, it's a pretty lame way to approach an issue worthy of serious analysis. The point of having life insurance on an income-generating individual in a family situation is to replace the income. Many financial planners use Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the probability that a retirement fund balance will last for a specified period. Monte Carlo analysis provides a backdoor way to consider the relative need for life insurance. When you identify the fund amount that generates a 95% probability of success, simply subtract $1 million from that amount and the difference is the life insurance need.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Mar,2018

Financial planners' long-standing, often paper-based processes were quickly becoming archaic and cumbersome, and the robo-adviser was viewed as the competitor, but now technology is increasingly viewed as a planner's team member. As the fast-paced digital world continues to take shape, financial institutions and planners need to engage with technology through various levels. Planners can incorporate technology into their practices in different ways. Many use a single provider that addresses multiple technology needs, from onboarding to trading and reporting, in one consolidated platform. At the end of the day, we are all consumers of digital tools.

JFP,Using a Behavioral Approach to Mitigate Panic and Improve Investor Outcomes,"In standard practice for financial planning, at least two competing demands are placed on the asset allocation process: taking on risk to help clients reach their financial goals, and decreasing risk to keep clients from panicking and abandoning the plan. To manage these competing demands, financial planners can apply two approaches: a risk capacity approach that focuses on goals and generating the required returns; and/or a risk preference approach that seeks to avoid panic. In isolation or in combination, these two approaches may fail to help clients reach their goals and forestall panic. This paper presents a third approach to helping clients. This behavioral approach brings behavioral interventions into the investment process and can potentially relieve the burden of these competing demands on asset allocation. To understand the benefits and limitations of each approach, this paper presents results from a novel simulation model of investor behavior. The model demonstrated how investor panic resulted in a loss of between 8 percent and 15 percent of assets over a 10-year period, under standard risk capacity-based asset allocations and risk preference-adjusted glide paths. The results were robust to a range of model specifications and assumptions. In moving from a standard approach of risk preference, adjusting glide paths to the proposed behavioral approach, investors may receive a net increase of 17% to 23% in assets over 10 years.","Wendel, Stephen, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Feb,2018

Behavioral portfolio theory says you may not need to rebalance, but if you do, behavioral rebalancing is different from mean-variance rebalancing. Central features in behavioral portfolio theory rest on the observation that aspirations drive risk attitudes. We invest for a chance to reach our aspirations, and risk is payment for a chance to avoid falling short of our aspirations. Shortfall aversion takes the role of risk aversion in behavioral portfolio theory, whereas variance aversion and loss aversion take that role in mean-variance portfolio theory.

This paper highlights how a portfolio's life can be extended by managing withdrawals from taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt accounts for a wide variety of clients, with graphs that help planners visualize the effects throughout the portfolio's life. Cook, Meyer, and Reichenstein (2015) showed that decumulating taxable investments coupled with converting to Roth IRAs in the early years of retirement to fully use the 15 percent tax rate bracket, followed by decumulating tax-deferred accounts in the later years of retirement to fully use the 15 percent tax rate bracket coupled with withdrawals from Roth retirement accounts can improve tax efficiency. Their analysis was extended here to consider Social Security benefits and required minimum distributions. It compared their recommended strategy to both a strategy that equates taxable income every year and a strategy some call the conventional wisdom. This comparison was made for a variety of circumstances. Results indicate that two strategies (one that fully uses the 15 percent tax rate bracket, and one that equalizes tax brackets across years by equalizing taxable incomes across years) outperformed the conventional wisdom for the variety of circumstances.","Geisler, Greg, PhD;Hulse, David S, PhD",1,1,13,1,14,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Feb,2018

While most financial planners know that most families will need help, many do not explore long-term services and supports (LTSS) planning beyond an analysis of long-term care (LTC) insurance needs. Planners can guide clients requiring LTSS to make better financial decisions with a fiduciary process that includes appropriate communication, relationship management, and technical skills. The focus here is not LTC insurance or planning for the possibility of care in the future, but rather how financial planners can optimize income, investment, and tax planning during a period of care. When modeling LTSS scenarios with planning software, the planner may overlook significant value. The traditional liquidation sequence may lead to higher risk and taxes and less money for care.

Prior to the 1980s, almost all economists assumed that people were rational actors. The significance of Thaler's work stems from the idea that people are less rational than assumed, and that psychology may influence human behavior in predictable ways. What follows is an overview of some of Thaler's research findings and applications to the field of financial planning. One of the financial planning implications from this paper is that investors should evaluate their portfolios annually in order to maximize happiness. Myopic behavior has been shown to influence the allocation decisions of individuals. Research co-authored by Thaler found that students who were shown monthly returns allocated 59% of their hypothetical allocation to a bond fund and the remainder to a stock fund. Some academic research includes economic assumptions that are unrealistic and thus the findings may not be directly relatable to financial planning practitioners.","Evensky, Harold, CFP, AIF;Guillemette, Michael A, PhD, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,18-Jan,2018

Listen for non-rational motivations. 4. Listen to build and protect your business.","Sofia, Robert",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Jan,2018
JFP,2017 Personal Finance Year in Review,"For the past three years during December, I've presented a 90-minute webinar for financial educators and counselors that reviews key personal finance news stories that took place during the previous calendar year. It is one of just a few comprehensive annual reviews of personal finance research, events, legislation, trends, and educational resources in existence. The webinar is an eclectic collection of facts and figures on a wide variety of personal finance topics. Those facts and figures are presented here, in article form, and the online version available at FPAJournal.org includes embedded source links for additional information. Information is organized according to general topic area, beginning with empirical research findings and concluding with a review of 2018 annual limits related to financial planning. This article has described dozens of 2017 research findings, trends, and government policy changes related to personal finance and anticipated changes in 2018. As of this writing, much uncertainty remained about the status of the Affordable Care Act and current tax laws.","O'Neill, Barbara, PhD, CFP",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Jan,2018
JFP,Hybrid Advice: Blurring the Roles of Client and Adviser,"I would like to preface this column by pointing out one thing: it is difficult to elucidate a specific incident that will happen in 2018. Rather, my ""prediction"" will highlight the evolution that is already occurring: the role of the adviser and client will continue to blur, moving us further toward the world of ""hybrid advice."" Hybrid advice is relatively new terminology that has begun to permeate the market. It is an interesting area of advice, sandwiched between our two current advice delivery models. The first advice model is not a recent trend, but rather, the way things were: traditional advice delivery, typically to baby boomers. Traditional advice delivery is what we all know -- advisers or other financial professionals visiting with their clients episodically throughout the year, delivering hard copy financial plans. The other advice model -- what we are witnessing today -- is consumers who want very little interaction with advisers, either because they merely do not wish to engage or they do not have enough investable assets.","Stich, Anthony",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Jan,2018
JFP,The Fruitful 50s: 7 Planning Opportunities for the Decade Before Retirement,"Most retirement planning topics focus on decisions and issues important just before, right as, or shortly after an individual or couple retires. This seems true in both professional journals and financial services trade publications, as well as in the consumer press. But a number of planning steps and strategies arise in the decade or so before retirement -- that is, in one's 50s usually -- that can have a big impact before the start of a retirement transition. In this column, however, I want to explore seven planning opportunities that are potentially available in the years before these cash flow transitions begin. These are: 1. building the nest egg, 2. income, 3. housing expenses, 4. what's no longer needed, 5. what may be need now, 6. portfolio allocation and 7. it may not be so complicated anymore.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Jan,2018

That same New York Times article reported that family caregivers lose more than $300,000 in wages and benefits over their lifetime because of the interruption in employment they experience providing care. In addition, family caregivers are often unhealthier and experience more emotional stress than their noncaregiving counterparts.

Cognitive decline is becoming one of the most pressing challenges faced by families, Daniel Kern and Renee Kwok wrote in the recent Financial Planning magazine article, ""Cognitive Decline: The Boomer Issue that Families Aren't Discussing,"" which also reported that financial literacy scores decline by about 1% per year after age 60.",Anonymous,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Jan,2018

Organic marketing is free marketing with no barrier to entry. Before you throw money at AdWords or rush out to hire a professional to do all your marketing for you, take a step back and consider that the only thing you actually have to invest is time.

Nobody wants to face this. We don't want to think of our parents getting older and (shudder) even passing away, and our parents probably don't want to think about it either.

JFP,Understand the Behaviors of Leaders and Team Members to Improve Your Organization,"Research on effective leadership shows that applying five specific leadership behaviors when working with each team member will improve your organization. Research also shows that team members can behave in three ways at work that improve their own work life. These actions of leaders and members are learnable, action-oriented, and easy to apply. Every financial planning practice can benefit from learning about these behaviors. Leaders motivate others to do what needs to be done. Implicit in this discussion is that the leader knows what needs getting done: increase revenue, attain more clients, ensure a smooth-running staff, or any other goal. A leader actively and consciously can act in five specific ways to improve the one-on-one work relationship with their team members.","Smith, David F, PhD, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18-Jan,2018

Approximately 76 million baby boomers are steamrolling toward retirement, and among them 58% of women of retirement age are going to need long-term care someday, versus only 47% of men, according to Time magazine.

JFP,Enhancing Financial Confidence Among Widows: The Role of Financial Professionals,"A renewed effort among researchers over the past decade has focused on better understanding the value financial planners add to their clients' well-being. Rather than focus on the benefits of financial planning strictly from an alpha viewpoint, several studies have examined other elements of a client's situation that improve when working with a financial planner. The present study was undertaken to further this line of inquiry by testing whether the interpersonal skill of a financial planner (i.e., a qualitative factor) is associated with a client's engagement in improved financial planning behavior, as well as increased financial confidence. The sample used for this study included widowed women who had remarried or entered into a long-term committed partnership. A primary contribution of this study is to help the financial planning community document another value of financial planning: building financial confidence among vulnerable populations.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP®;West, Carrie L, PhD;Leitz, Linda Y, PhD, CFP®;Rehl, Kathleen M, PhD, CFP®;Moor, Carolyn C;Hernandez, Michele N;Bradley, Susan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Dec,2017

JFP,Stop Questioning Your Profession's Status,"The financial planning profession seems to suffer from an identity crisis, more so in my opinion from those who have been at it for a longer time. It seems to me that younger planners embrace the profession without the impediments of philosophizing on what the profession should be. Financial planning is complex and multifaceted in its functions and roles. Collectively, we serve multiple generations, different classes of people, all with different goals. If you toss in words like fiduciary, broker-dealer, registered investment adviser, compensation neutrality, fee-only, and many others, framing the profession into a neat, definitive standard becomes challenging.

Ten thousand hours of study and training is the criteria experts say will give us ""mastery"" of anything. Emotional or social intelligence, called EQ, will become more important than IQ knowledge. IQ is easily replicated by machine learning and artificial intelligence. EQ is harder for computers to master, and it is the area clients are craving -- someone who can make sense of a world seemingly going haywire and discussing change in terms they can understand. The good news: EQ can be taught and learned.

JFP,Meet Today's Challenges by Becoming a Well-Being Adviser,"A client fires his financial adviser because his returns lag the market and the returns of his best friend. An adviser constructs portfolios from low-cost index funds, and his clients question why he trades so infrequently -- only once a quarter when he rebalances portfolios. An organizer of a conference for financial advisers asks a speaker to refer to the advisers in attendance as ""wealth managers,"" not ""financial advisers."" An adviser argues that robo-advisers can never replace human advisers. These are four of the markers of the financial advising landscape; they represent four challenges financial advisers face. I argue that advisers can meet these challenges by becoming well-being advisers, a role that is rooted in the second generation of behavioral finance, distinct from both standard finance and the first generation of behavioral finance.","Statman, Meir, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Dec,2017

In the recent InvestmentNews article ""Morningstar CEO Describes Future of Adviser Tech,"" Morningstar's Kunal Kapoor told readers that artificial intelligence and big data will help financial planners do two things: better understand who their clients are and what their biases are, and know how to help those clients more proactively.

He wants to continue to build upon the work of their previous leaders and what they've been able to do to get the organization to where it is today. He wants to also embed the social impact that they're having as planners within this profession. When they are helping individuals on a pro bono basis, it's almost as if they are right there at a crosswalk with them, and as they are getting ready to step in front of a bus, they pull them back.

Left to ourselves, the latest thoughts in financial planning often lie there, unread. Sometimes, it's easier to make time for reading research when we have some external motivation -- people to whom we feel accountable. Try following these book club tips to keep your research discussions lively: 1. Be serious about the topic but not the meeting format. 2. The amount of research you discuss in a year will be a function of how often your study group meets. 3. Decide in advance who will host the research discussion.

Helping clients reduce fear and anxiety by better understanding and more effectively managing today's unique mix of new and unfamiliar risks, plus established, yet ever-evolving risks we've traditionally dealt with, is a critical client need to address. We can help clients reduce their fears, uncertainty, and risk, plus regain their confidence and sense of control by using two methods: comprehensive, holistic, personal risk management planning; and/or the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity model used effectively by the military.

JFP,"Crafting Retirement Income That Is Stable, Secure, and Sustainable","Financial planners are driven by the passionate desire to serve clients with evidence-based convictions. Yet, planners often seem locked in a battle with each other over the superior method to deliver retirement income to clients. Often, this leads to staking out a position that one method is universally superior to others. In retirement planning, planners should consider a logical, definitional-based framework as convictional where empirical, evidence-based information is not available or is unclear. Our view is that the only clear answer to this deeper question for retirement income is found in what we call the 3-S model framework: it must be simultaneously stable, secure, and sustainable. Any 3-S approach (agreement-based, mortality-based, or historically based) can be reasonable and prudent to cover base expenses with a minimum coverage ratio of 1:1. Planners should use their knowledge, judgement, and discretion about their client to offer solutions or the best combination of solutions to craft retirement income in an unknowable context.","Branning, Jason K, CFP®;Grubbs, M Ray, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Dec,2017
JFP,Examining Total Portfolio Performance: U.S. Government Vs. Corporate Bonds,"Stocks, compared to bonds, have historically contributed more volatility and return to portfolios. Adding bonds to a portfolio has been shown to decrease portfolio volatility. The bond asset class can be broken down into a variety of sub-asset classes, including: 1. US government, 2. corporate, and 3. international debt, among others. Each bond asset class has its own unique risk and return characteristics. Although there are many bond asset classes, the focus of this study was on the two oldest bond asset classes: US government bonds and domestic corporate bonds. This choice was guided by the availability of robust index data since 1926. US government-backed debt has been noted as the superior portfolio diversifier. Thus, this study sought to test and quantify the value of US government debt relative to UScorporate debt in a portfolio alongside stocks with the goal to better enable financial planners to produce the optimum portfolio allocation for their clients.","Luskin, Jon, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Dec,2017

Some federal tax provisions can be used to help those affected recoup some of their losses, namely casualty loss deductions, and for those in federally declared disaster areas (qualified disaster areas), special extensions of time to comply with certain tax responsibilities. For individuals to claim a casualty loss on their federal income tax return, they must itemize deductions on Schedule A, Itemized Deductions. To determine the amount of the casualty loss, subtract any insurance money received (or the amount expected to be received from the insurance company) from the basis in the property. If one receives more insurance proceeds than the basis in their property, there will be a casualty gain.

Given that the value of a fee-based advisory practice is often the largest asset that most advisers own, it is a good question in need of good answers. The starting place for most advisers who need a formal valuation is this simple mantra: purpose, standard, approach, and method. These are the key starting points in every valuation engagement. Any time a business appraisal is needed, the standard of value, approach, and method(s) used for estimating value should be tied directly to the purpose or reason that the valuation is being conducted. Value is a function of purpose, and the answer is not universally applicable to every situation. The most common reasons why your practice valued include non-tax valuation and tax valuation.

JFP,Valuing Roth Conversion and Recharacterization Options,"This paper explains the options provided by the tax code for Roth conversions and recharacterizations. Models are presented of the after-tax value of Roth conversion strategies to the strategy of retaining funds in a TDA and withdrawing these funds in a later year. Four reasonable cases illustrate how the Roth conversion and recharacterization options in the tax code could allow a taxpayer to increase the after-tax value of the funds converted to a Roth account by 5.56 percent, compared to the strategy of retaining these same funds in a tax-deferred account until later in retirement. One particular case, in which the Roth conversion increased the after-tax value by 62.79 percent, reflects the situation many taxpayers face. An example explains what a financial adviser should do to take advantage of the Roth conversion/ recharacterization options available in the tax code.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA;Meyer, William",0,0,9,1,9,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Nov,2017
JFP,Reviewing Asset Allocation in the Context of the Retirement Plan,"Advisers should consider these factors, as follows, when deciding on the aggressiveness of both spending and asset allocation within a retirement income plan: 1. capacities (resiliencies), 2. aspirations (goals), 3. returns (assumptions), 4. emotional comfort (constraints). Meanwhile, a more aggressive retiree will tend to fall in the opposite direction on these matters, highlighting the highly personal and complex nature of these decisions. It is only after thinking about these different types of questions and assessing assets and liabilities on the retirement balance sheet that clients are able to fully determine their appropriate asset allocation and withdrawal rate decisions.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Nov,2017
JFP,A Fiduciary Approach for Clients Who Need Long-Term Services and Supports,"The rising financial cost of long-term care in the US widely understood. The enormous personal challenge for family caregivers is also well documented. More than two-thirds of 65-year-olds will need assistance planning for a possible period of care at some point, according to a 2013 Congressional Budget Office report. Although most financial planners know that families will need help, many do not explore long-term services and supports (LTSS) planning beyond an analysis of long-term care insurance needs. Furthermore, many planners have little or no training in advising families through a current period of care. This article builds on research and knowledge from the medical, caregiving, and financial professions to provide guidance on working with clients navigating periods of care. Further research on clients' LTSS experiences should produce findings that will enable planners to make more accurate financial planning assumptions for their clients during a period of LTSS.","West, Thomas C, CLU®, ChFC®, AIF®;Starnes, Steven A, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,17-Nov,2017

The consumption gap is between people's actual consumption and potential consumption made possible by their wealth. In the February 2016 Journal paper, ""Spending in Retirement: Determining the Consumption Gap,"" Chris Browning and his co-authors found consumption gaps among people with median financial assets, not only among the wealthy. Adviser questions following my presentation were not about how to help clients find joy in spending their ample assets on themselves, their families, and the needy. Instead, they were about the ""retirement crisis"" and the need to encourage people to save more and spend less. We tackle the saving and spending task with the mental tools of framing, mental accounting, and self-control. Self-control can be excessive. Indeed, excessive self-control is as prevalent as insufficient self-control.","Statman, Meir, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Nov,2017

This is the mistake most advisers make -- they think they find a great marketing idea and want to try it. They do an excellent job executing, except for one fatal flaw: they try to guess what their target market wants. They spend a lot of time brainstorming and wondering what to write in a blog post, or record for a video or podcast, or how to host an event.

Data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) Investor Survey were used to explore client profiles, portfolio characteristics, adviser-use characteristics, and client perceptions. Some client characteristics were related to the type of services provided by each compensation model. By understanding these profiles, financial planners can help focus their marketing material and skills toward the types of clients who are most likely to use their services. The variation in client profiles is important to consider within the context of pending Department of Labor fiduciary requirements. Given identical standards of care, these profiles provide evidence that there are significant market demands for services of all compensation models.","Seay, Martin C, PhD, CFP®;Anderson, Somer G, CPA;Lawson, Derek R, CFP®;Kim, Kyoung Tae, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,1,7,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Oct,2017

Results of this analysis demonstrate an important contrast with the results of the earlier literature; specifically, the greater percentages of home value, when coordinated with the retirement savings portfolio, resulted in substantially greater percentages of the portfolio that can be drawn. This paper suggests a new alternative to the 4 percent rule that can guide planners and retirees toward an optimal cash withdrawal strategy. This new rule takes into account the total of the retiree's retirement savings plus his or her home value. The quantitative analysis in this paper uses the same spreadsheet models and strategies first presented in the Journal by Sacks and Sacks (2012).

JFP,Choosing a Continuing Care Facility,"A growing number of seniors and their caregivers select a life care facility based on the elder person's immediate care needs without a thought for the future. You begin in advising your clients if they are talking about any kind of supportive housing arrangements, such as an assisted living facility or continuing care retirement community (CCRC), for themselves or for their parents. CCRCs are not independent living communities, assisted living facilities, or nursing homes. They are combinations of all of these residential and care options, which are staffed to provide a ""continuum of care'"" for residents. The assisted living and nursing home components of CCRCs are usually intended for use only by residents from the independent living units that are part of the CCRC and not by seniors from outside of the facility.

Gathering feedback from clients on what they value most about your service offerings is a critical step to developing your brand. Later in this article, I'll discuss three techniques you can employ today to build a more focused brand using that client feedback. Those three techniques are: 1. Clarify who you are. 1. Clear the clutter. 3. Communicate in a compelling way. Apple, the world's top brand, is a good example of the financial value of earned trust. The value of Apple's brand increases its market value by 21%, according to Forbes' list of top brands for 2017.

If you're not in tune with the life transitions your clients are going through -- or will soon go through -- it could mean clients will leave your practice. In this article, we'll show you that there is a need for fundamentally focusing on life transitions to positively impact the well-being of both your client and your practice. There are three things to consider when providing clients a life-centered plan: 1. It must address the transitions unique to each client. 2. It is better to prepare than to repair. Much self-sabotaging financial behavior could be avoided by proactively addressing life transitions. 3. There is an umbilical relationship between life being in transition and money being in motion. Consequently, the common transitions most financial advisers address are children going to college, retirement, purchasing a home, and death.","Anthony, Mitch;Sanduski, Steve, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,7,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Oct,2017

The Spanish-speaking population has been growing steadily and is expected to continue doing so. This consistently growing market represents opportunities across various industries. Although some industries have experienced revenue growth by catering to Spanish-speaking consumers, the financial planning and advising sectors have been significantly behind. An online search of Certified Financial Planner and other financial advisers who identify themselves as fiduciaries (including non-Latino planners) produces few results of those who explicitly also offer their services in Spanish. The 2016 annual report published by the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce found that the Hispanic share of all new entrepreneurs was 20.8%, versus 10% a decade ago. One reason more planners do not appear to be catering to Spanish-speaking clients could be due to a common misconception about this market segment.","Gonzalez, Claudia",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Oct,2017

JFP,Don't Let the Tax Reform Tail Wag the Dog,"There has been much talk about tax reform recently, but little action. The partisan divide that has characterized Washington over the past several years has prevented any meaningful attempts to make substantive changes to the tax code. Since the 2016 election, the new administration and Congressional leaders have indicated that tax reform will be a top priority. The president and several prominent members of Congress have proposed a complete repeal of the estate tax that would be partially offset by limiting the step-to basis provision of Section 1014. Should this proposal be adopted, this would be a real win for affluent taxpayers. Life insurance policies purchased to provide liquidity for the estate or to pay estate taxes will no longer be needed. Planners and their clients can move to simplify their wealth transfer plans and unwind the complex, costly structures and insurance policies used to avoid or ease the burden of the estate tax.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA, CFP®",1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,17-Oct,2017

At that time, he had known he wanted to work and grow in the planning/wealth management profession, but he wasn't completely convinced that a client-facing adviser role was right for him. To be honest, the client-facing portion of the internship was my least favorite. Centering his schedule around client meetings proved to be difficult, the meeting preparation process was arduous, and the almost daily face-to-face interactions through long meetings with clients became draining.

JFP,Does the Benefit of Deferring Social Security Offset the Opportunity Cost to Do So?,"This study examined the extent to which deferring the claiming date for Social Security benefits preserved an individual's tax-deferred retirement assets, thus enhancing the ability to provide for constant real consumption. The analysis incorporated the relevant reductions and credits for early and late claiming, mortality risk, stochastic investment returns, and the availability of longevity insurance. Results provide guidance for financial planners to help clients make the optimal claiming decision. For single and married individuals with substantial savings, the deferral of benefits reduced the risk of retirement asset exhaustion. The results demonstrate the unique nature of the Social Security asset in the retirement portfolio as well as the value of self-insuring against longevity risk.","Alderson, Michael J, PhD;Betker, Brian L, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Sep,2017

JFP,Risks in Advanced Age: A Review of Research and Possible Solutions,"This paper reviews both published and emerging research on different risks retirees in advanced age face and possible solutions financial planners can use to help clients overcome behavioral hurdles. Risk assessment questions that measure loss aversion, as well as reducing myopic behavior, can help keep clients in portfolios that align with their preferences. Older people have an inclination to reject evidence of declining skills, but if financial planners make clients aware of their declining cognitive and financial literacy abilities before retirement, they may be more willing to choose simplified and satisfactory solutions. Longevity ""insurance"" can be an effective way to help clients spend more during their early retirement years, while protecting them against the tail risk of running out of money prior to death. A financial plan that includes ways the planner and client can work together to overcome inevitable risks in advanced age should improve the likelihood of helping clients achieve their financial and life goals.","Guillemette, Michael A, PhD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,6,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Sep,2017

In addition, she is fascinated by people and how they are built. She is always looking for ways to help people understand their strengths and talents and then maximize the use of those strengths in life and work. Their profession has evolved. Outside of brokerages and wirehouses, sales assistants don't really exist anymore. In most cases, they have been elevated to client service and operations titles and roles. In many financial planning firms, this role is seen as the lowest on the career ladder and often an entry-level position that can become a revolving door of associates who come and go.","Kirchenbauer, Lisa A K, CFP®, RLP®, CeFT®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Sep,2017

Use the framework to harness financial planning policies as decision-architecture to overcome the unique challenges millennials face and prepare them to be stewards of the resources they will accumulate and inherit.

All are critical areas in which they serve their clients to help them stay on track with their financial goals and needs. However, as clients age, other issues related to life and finances arise -- especially in later life. Often financial planners are unwilling or reluctant to address these issues as there have been few, if any, financial planning courses teaching them how to address questions. The complexity of life, cultural bias about discussing death and disability, and family dynamics often leave families to deal with these issues in crisis mode. Helping their clients and their families plan for and live late life well has a place in their offering as financial planners.

Increased frequencies of investment-related educational communications were positively associated with the likelihood of continuing to use the planner in the future and the percentage of assets managed by the planner. Greater frequencies of noninvestment- related educational communications were associated with a larger number of referrals. Greeting cards and personal notes were found to be more relevant than non-investment-related educational communications when building client satisfaction and trust. The overuse of interest and hobby communications was found to result in lower levels of satisfaction, trust, and commitment.

JFP,How to Use Qualified Charitable Distributions as a Tax-Saving Tool,"Qualified charitable distributions (QCD) from individual retirement accounts (IRA) to qualified charities were first allowed in 2006, but it was a bi-annual planning question whether Congress would allow the transaction for another two years. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act) eliminated these concerns by permanently adding QCDs to the law starting in 2016. The QCD is not reported in income, and no charitable deduction is claimed. Although it seems like the result would be the same if the individual included the IRA distribution in income, contributed the distribution to charity, and then deducted the charitable contribution on his or her tax return, using a QCD is more beneficial in many scenarios. To qualify as a QCD, the distributions must be made to an organization that qualifies for a charitable deduction other than a private (grant-making) foundation, donor-advised fund, or charitable trust.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP®;Daff, Leslie, JD",1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,17-Aug,2017

JFP,A 3-Step Procedure for Computing Sustainable Retirement Savings Withdrawals,"Retirement planning involves coordinating income from multiple sources such that savings are not depleted prematurely, no large undesired surplus is left behind, and disposable income is maximized. This paper proposes a practical retirement savings withdrawal procedure using a free online calculator that addresses these objectives. The procedure is called 3-PEAT. The heart of 3-PEAT is a linear programming application that computes an optimal retirement income management plan whose results include annual savings withdrawals and maximum disposable income for the term of the plan. The 3-PEAT requires that the retiree adapt to variable annual disposable income. The procedure increases withdrawals in rising markets and reduces withdrawals in down markets. Because it is a procedure, it is amenable to simulation. This paper analyzed 3-PEAT simulations for six historical stock market periods. Results show that when 3-PEAT was compared to other variable withdrawal methods, it increased disposable income, prevented savings from being depleted prematurely, and reduced the variability of annual disposable income.","Welch, James S, Jr",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Aug,2017

JFP,The Endowment Effect: Why Executives Love Their Company's Stock,"Senior corporate executives are a large segment of their firm's practice. As such, the merit of diversifying portfolios highly concentrated in company stock is a frequent discussion. Generally, the concentration builds over many years due to stock bonuses, deferred compensation, stock options, restricted stock grants, other corporate asset accumulation plans, and occasional market purchases. Sometimes companies mandate that senior executives hold a certain amount of stock, perhaps as a percentage of compensation. Even when this is a consideration, most executives have difficulty diversifying holdings beyond policy requirements. In the field of portfolio management, much has been written on the generally unfavorable risk/reward metrics of overly concentrated portfolios, especially when the concentration is in a single security. Most of their executive clients acknowledge that their portfolios are exposed to unsystematic market risks and readily agree that if they were counseling clients, they would recommend diversification.

According to Kochis, the biggest hurdle holding firm owners back from achieving a successful succession is the emotional impact. While this is the biggest stumbling block to actually making a successful transition, it's not the only one. The others are the operational readiness of the firm for a transition, and then the financial terms have to be acceptable to all the parties. It can't be one-sided.

Currently, taxpayers can deduct medical and dental expenses that are more than 10% of their adjusted gross income (of course, financial planners should keep an eye on legislation; a current proposal would eliminate medical expenses as an itemized deduction). Medical insurance reimbursements reduce the deductible amount. Self-employed taxpayers may be able to deduct 100% of their health insurance costs in arriving at adjusted gross income.

JFP,Marketing Answers from the Pros,"When it comes to marketing, planners likely have many questions. It can seem overwhelming. But the advice from marketing professionals and marketing-savvy planners included in this article will help guide planners and get them started in the right direction. The message seems to be clear: start your marketing efforts pronto. It's not an option anymore; it's a necessity. Also, get your Web site up to speed, at the very least get a Twitter account, and utilize some form of content marketing to establish yourself as a personable, relatable, problem-solving expert. Victor Gaxiola, head of customer advocacy, Hearsay Systems, said that the ease of access and distribution of content make it the most transparent and open network. His best tip to get started is to follow industry leaders, be part of the conversation, and freely share content that adds value to those who follow you. Tina C.

JFP,"Integrating Behavioral Finance, Financial Psychology, and Financial Therapy into the 6-Step Financial Planning Process","Clients have strong emotions around their money, yet there is a tendency to focus solely on the economic aspects of a client's financial well-being. In their work with clients, many financial planners utilize CFP Board's six-step Financial Planning Practice Standards. Traditionally, this framework focuses on financial data-gathering and financial goals, and does not necessarily include the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of a client's money-related issues. This paper provides a framework for integrating behavioral finance, financial psychology, and financial therapy theory and tools into the six-step financial planning process to help planners provide more comprehensive and effective services. Financial planning stands to benefit greatly should the profession choose to adopt and integrate behavioral finance, financial psychology, and financial therapy theory and practices.","Lawson, Derek R, CFP®;Klontz, Bradley T, PsyD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Jul,2017

Craig Faulkner, CEO of FMG Suite, wrote that social media profiles with a 3:2:1 ratio of evergreen (always relevant informative content), topical (current news that could affect your followers), and personal content (posts about you), perform best.

Less affluent respondents reported taking fewer financial risks. Results also showed that net worth was associated with conceptualizing and understanding risk and return trade-offs.

Ultimately, trusts designed to span multiple decades -- or even forever -- can only be as successful as the trustees. Most importantly, trustees bear a fiduciary responsibility to ethically act in the best interests of the trust beneficiaries. When considering a family member, discuss these considerations with clients: 1. Make sure you and the grantor understand exactly what the trust document's purpose and specific provisions are prior to naming the trustee. 2. Ensure the prospective trustee understands your clients' family history. 3. Be sure to select prudent and accessible trustees who can carry out the provisions of the trust and manage investment, tax, accounting, legal, and interpersonal issues. 4. Carefully review trust candidate qualifications and look at their backgrounds to see if they have ever been sued in a trust or investment-related lawsuit.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP®, CTFA, AEP®;Boone, Linda Lubitz, CFP®",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Jun,2017

It really was born of a number of things that were going on, both in the industry and her own life. First, she was taking a harder look at what success really looked like with advisers. For so many years she had focused almost exclusively on client engagement, and she had quite a narrow focus in that area. And she would have argued that client engagement is what makes people successful when they get it right. For a financial adviser, you are absolutely engaged if you have intentionally designed a business that is at that intersection of growth and fulfillment.

JFP,Investing after the End of the Golden Age,"The ""Golden Age"" of investing provided more than three decades of strong investment returns beginning in 1982. Despite two steep equity market corrections in the 1990s, the S&amp;P 500 Index provided double-digit annualized returns during the multi-decade rally. Bonds also rallied strongly, providing significant price appreciation as 10-year US Treasury yields declined from double-digit to low single-digit levels. Investors during the Golden Age benefited from market-friendly policy changes, favorable demographics, and increasing global trade. These positive factors served as tailwinds for stock and bond markets. However, many of the tailwinds are now becoming headwinds, and financial advisers and their clients will need to adapt to a less favorable outlook for markets. Today, many of the tailwinds from the Golden Age are becoming headwinds. Understanding these headwinds will help advisers best guide clients' investing decisions.

Their default -- because it's easier and more natural -- is to be more like Homer Simpson than Mr. Spock of Star Trek fame. A limitation with using mind-mapping or like-minded exercises to uncover a client's true emotional state is that, to the extent they explore emotions, they may actually traffic in feelings. Psychologists distinguish between emotions and feelings -- emotions subconsciously and spontaneously occur; feelings are cognitively filtered instances of self-reporting. In other words, people don't think their emotions, they experience them. Therefore, facial coding could be another tool to use to get more accurate insights into your clients.","Hill, Dan, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Jun,2017

The publication of A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel in 1973, which presented an argument for passive investing understandable to the common investor, helped propel passive investing. In 2014, the amount of wealth invested passively by US investors eclipsed 20%. This represents a sizable shift in assets and thinking about investing. Moreover, the debate on whether to use passive or active investment strategies now includes a middle ground, smart beta strategies, which generally are transparent and rules-based like passive strategies while focused on achieving factor exposures or investment beliefs like active strategies. A commonly held belief is that one should invest passively where active opportunity is considered low, such as highly efficient markets like US large-cap equities, and invest actively where markets are less efficient and opportunity is high, such as emerging markets equities and small-cap equities.","Pittman, Sam, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Jun,2017

JFP,RMD Arbitrage: Strategies for Legally Delaying and Reducing RMDs,"It has been widely acknowledged that, in most cases, the best use of an inherited IRA for a non-spouse is typically to use the ""stretch provisions"" to stretch out the distributions over the beneficiary's life expectancy, rather than taking a lump sum or a five-year distribution. The main principle behind the inherited IRA stretch strategy is that it allows the IRA assets to remain tax-deferred for the longest possible time frame. Therefore, younger beneficiaries, such as grandchildren and great-grandchildren, could stand to receive the greatest benefit from an inherited IRA, because they have a longer life expectancy over which required distributions may be stretched. Technically, it is not possible to change one's own required minimum distribution schedule. However, in a majority of American households, the age gap between the two spouses is greater than one year. The primary objective of this research was to determine whether age gaps created advantages for savings in a younger spouse's IRA relative to savings in the older spouse's IRA.","Vaughan, Caleb W, CFP®",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Jun,2017

Many dislike the fact that they had to learn about P&amp;C for the CFP certification examination, even though they had no interest in the topic and knew they would never be licensed for that type of insurance. Indeed, the common advice from planners regarding P&amp;C insurance is to find a good P&amp;C agent, which presumably exonerates the planner from any responsibility if something goes wrong. If you completed an approved education program, you should have been exposed to myriad insurance topics, including (P&amp;C) insurance for individuals and businesses. Still, few of them learn the topic well, and even fewer retain the information. Yet mistakes in the P&amp;C area can be catastrophic financially for your clients.

The US Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, in updating its Occupational Outlook Handbook, has projected an extremely positive job outlook for financial planners with a growth of 30% through 2024 -- much faster than related professions. Although demand is high, the future supply of quality financial planners is uncertain.

Survey respondents were quizzed on their reverse mortgage literacy; they performed poorly with an average score of 48%. The existence of a relationship with a financial adviser did not increase the likelihood the respondents would consider a reverse mortgage, nor did it increase their reverse mortgage knowledge. Overall, respondents did not have a positive view of reverse mortgages as a retirement income tool.

JFP,It's Time to Reexamine Your Fee Schedule,The growth of the fee-based advice model has been one of the most significant developments in the financial planning profession over the last 30 years. They have gone from a world dominated by commissions to a world where advisers now derive more revenue from fees than from commissions. The trend toward fee-based advice has been driven primarily by a desire to find a business model that removes some of the conflicts of interest inherent in the commission-based model. Compensating an adviser based on a percentage of assets under management may remove the incentive to recommend unnecessary trades to generate a commission. But charging for advice based on a percentage of assets under management does not perfectly align an adviser's interests with the client's.

JFP,Can Institutional Style Factor Analysis Benefit Retail Wealth Management?,"Traditionally, when advisers think about portfolio construction and drivers of risk, they think in terms of asset classes. However, in the institutional investment space, more and more asset allocators and risk managers are thinking in terms of factors instead of asset classes. Start with a discussion of the difference between factors and asset classes. Strictly speaking, factors are underlying drivers of risk and return while asset classes are groupings of similar types of investments.

JFP,Tightwads and Spenders: Predicting Financial Conflict in Couple Relationships,"Financial problems are consistently reported as a top stressor for Americans, contributing to marital conflict and dissolution. The purpose of this paper was to determine how spending personalities contribute to financial conflict between partners. Data were obtained from husbands, wives, and their households from the Flourishing Families dataset. Respondents were on average 45 to 46 years old and had been married for 18 years. The top predictors of financial conflict for husbands included perceptions of a spendy wife, having financial worries, reporting a lower income, having three or more children, and having a wife who thinks he is too spendy. The top predictors of financial conflict for wives included having a husband who thinks she is too spendy, feeling a lack of communication with her husband, having financial worries, having a husband with low income, and having perceptions of a spendy husband. Planners should take note of the results and openly discuss perceptions of spending and saving behavior during the initial client meeting and subsequent interactions.","Britt, Sonya L, PhD, CFP®;Hill, E Jeffrey, PhD;LeBaron, Ashley;Lawson, Derek R, CFP®;Bean, Roy A, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-May,2017

JFP,Dick Wagner on Why Financial Planning Is the Most Important Profession of the Century,"In an interview, financial planning pioneer Richard B. ""Dick"" Wagner, J.D., CFP, talked about why financial planning is the most important profession of the century. According to Wagner, for planners, he thinks there are actually two key points. One is that money is the most powerful and pervasive secular force on the planet, which speaks to huge responsibility. And two, that they are generating the most important profession of the 21st century. He wants people to wonder about that, but he wants them to also be open to the possibility that this is a true statement; he believes it is. He first made that statement years ago in the speeches he made when he was president of the ICFP [a predecessor organization of FPA]. He puts it in there as a method of thinking aspirationally about the importance of financial planning, but he has thought a lot about it since. He thinks maybe what needs to be updated are the attributes of a quality and qualified personal financial adviser.","Yeske, Dave, DBA, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-May,2017
JFP,Transforming from ROI-Centric Planning to Return on Life Planning,"The financial planning profession has made several transformations over the past few decades. Prior to 1980, most financial advisers were brokers who sold stocks and bonds on commission. During the 1980s and 1990s, stocks gave way to mutual funds and asset allocation. Today, prodded by the millennial generation, they're seeing a strong movement toward redefining money. As Daniel Pink pointed out in his 2005 book, A Whole New Mind, the value propositions of the future are going to be rooted and grounded in the right side of the brain, meaning that the human element is what people are willing to pay for. Everything else is going to eventually become commoditized. In financial planning, the human element is best expressed in the discovery and review processes. The traditional financial advice path and focus has been on numbers and returns (return on investment, or ROI). The Return on Life (ROL) model subordinates ROI into a tertiary value, existing only to support ROL and highly personalized planning.","Anthony, Mitch;Sanduski, Steve, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-May,2017

The most recent edition of CFP Board's Financial Planning Competency Handbook illustrates this integration with new chapters on financial therapy, behavioral finance, and marriage and family therapy applications to financial planning. The Journal has also recognized the benefits of this trend, as evidenced by the 2016 Montgomery-Warschauer Award given to Sarah Asebedo and Martin Seay for their psychology and financial planning integration article ""From Functioning to Flourishing: Applying Positive Psychology to Financial Planning"" published in the November 2015 issue. Early efforts to integrate psychology with finance focused on behavioral finance. Behavioral finance is built on the premise that human beings don't always act in their best financial interests. Practicing financial planners, who frequently witness clients act against their own interests, intuitively understand this. Their knowledge about behavioral finance has grown from laboratory research and analyzing large datasets.","Klontz, Bradley T, PsyD, CFP®;Horwitz, Edward J, PhD, CFP®, ChFC®, FBS, CLU®, CSA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-May,2017

JFP,What Celebrities Can Teach Us about Estate Planning,"It is interesting how the common estate planning mistakes of average clients are so often replicated and exaggerated in celebrity situations. This column will discuss some of the things the authors can learn from high-profile celebrity estates, recognizing that their typical clients receive much less media attention and, often enough, have a few less zeros on their estate values. It is not that celebrity estates are more confounding than your average client's estate. It's that most celebrities have been allotted more than 15 minutes of media time, with much of it collected after they die. Dying without a will doesn't damage the deceased, but it sure makes it hard on the survivors. Abraham Lincoln was shot on Apr 14, 1865. He died the next morning without a will despite being a skilled and successful attorney. He left an estate of $110,296.80.

But never underestimate the fundamentals -- as Michael Jordan said, ""Get the fundamentals down, and the level of everything you do will rise."" Psychologist Roy F. Baumeister studies a lot about human behavior, including what they call ""willpower""and what he calls ""self-regulation."" His studies have found that willpower acts like a muscle: if you use it, over time it gets stronger. In the short run, it depletes. Baumeister's research also teaches two important lessons about willpower. First, before making a tough decision or performing a task that requires willpower, find a way to replenish it. Second, don't rely on willpower any more than you have to; instead, leverage good habits and rules. The key is to make the rule simple and clear. Ambiguity makes it easier for the human brain to make deals with itself for why an exception is okay. Also, try some limited-time experiments.","Birke, Kol, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-May,2017

But he doesn't meet some financial advisers' expectations of a succession planning expert. When he first started presenting on these topics, he was introduced as the ""boy wonder of succession planning"" in front of an audience of about 200 senior advisers. The first piece of advice he has for G2s is: try to imagine yourself in G1's position and see the opportunity from the founder's perspective. A successful negotiation begins with having the right mindset, and successors must understand the history and foundation of the firm.

This paper seeks to move the financial planning profession forward by examining six factors known to have a significant impact on sustainability: 1. time horizon, 2. interest rates, 3. fees and expenses, 4. asset allocation, 5. inflation, and 6. withdrawal strategy. Bootstrapping simulation techniques provided the basis for the analysis, and the results serve to clarify and quantify the relative impact of each of the six factors.

If you are a gambler, bet on the husband to go first. As financial planners, they need to get their clients ready. According to the US Census Bureau, of the estimated 1 million people widowed each year, approximately 88% will be women. Currently, 85% of the approximately 14 million Americans who have lost their spouses are women. While no ""to-do"" list is exhaustive, below are some easy-to-follow steps to work on with your clients: 1. Create a scenario plan. 2. Make sure life insurance is adequate. 3.

JFP,Because Retirees Aren't Spreadsheets,"Retirees often cover ongoing living expenses with Social Security and any pension benefits. If these sources aren't enough, they are sometimes advised to cover the rest by using assets to purchase guaranteed sources of inflation-adjusted income, such as bond ladders or single premium immediate annuities (SPIA). Depending which they choose, the use of retirement savings to fund these ""essential"" expenses can be an irrevocable decision. The amount of capital required to fund each real dollar of such lifetime spending is about $30. Consider the financial planning implications of this, beginning with the amount of capital needed to fund essential or core lifestyle spending. This, of course, directly determines what's available for items that don't meet the definition of core spending. But even with this adjustment to the core-discretionary spending dichotomy, there could still be unintended lifestyle costs.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Apr,2017

After many conversations with planners and advisers, as well as friends and family members, the author believes the needs and concerns that affect seniors and their families fall into six major areas. By approaching them topically, rather than by age, you can help your clients address these concerns based on specific need, whenever that need might occur. The six areas are: 1. physical, 2. cognitive and psychological, 3. family, 4. financial, 5. legal, and 6. legacy.","Kornegay, Susan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Apr,2017
JFP,The Impact of Guaranteed Income and Dynamic Withdrawals on Safe Initial Withdrawal Rates,"Optimal safe initial withdrawal rates can differ significantly across relatively similar retiree household scenarios and to a much larger extent than has been commonly noted in retirement income research. Important variables to consider are the amount of guaranteed income, the extent to which the household can adjust consumption, the risk of the investment portfolio, the return assumptions used for projections, and the degree of income stability desired by the retiree. Guaranteed income had the largest impact on the estimated safe initial withdrawal rates among the variables considered. Those withdrawal rates varied by more than 4% points for different levels of guaranteed income. Although recent research using forward-looking returns suggested that 3% is a more appropriate safe initial withdrawal rate for retirees today, this analysis suggested that 4% is likely still a much better starting place for many retirees, although the optimal target varies considerably.","Blanchett, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Apr,2017

The second change pertains to refunds from an educational institution paid by means of a qualified 529 plan distribution. The refund may now be redeposited back into the student’s 529 plan account without the imposition of taxes or penalties as long as the funds are returned within 60 days of the date they were withdrawn.

Nobody knew how to help -- not her financial adviser, her doctor, her family, her friends, the community. She essentially had to navigate her way through grief by the seat of her pants.

The average 65-year-old man can be expected to live into his mid-80s, one-fourth live past age 90, and 10% live past 95. The average 65-year-old-woman has an even longer life expectancy. Affluent individuals have actuarial life expectancies beyond the averages and often have complex financial considerations requiring high levels of cognitive function. Although increased life spans bring great benefits, the potential for cognitive decline is an important consideration for financial advisers. Dementia is defined as the loss of cognitive and mental functions severe enough to impair a person's daily functioning, and estimates indicate that nearly 15% of Americans over age 70 suffer from some form of dementia.

JFP,Developing a Framework to Craft a Value Proposition,"Value proposition serves as the starting point for every marketing activity, prospecting strategy, and client service activity. And yet, very few planners talk about their practice in a unique way. But, the few planners who do articulate their value find tremendous success. The majority of planners tend to be logical and analytical. They like numbers and math. These are the crucial left-brain attributes needed to be a successful planner. Yet, to be a successful marketer requires a strong dose of right-brain attributes, especially creativity. This could explain why so many planners struggle to describe their value in a way in which the prospective client could relate. This article proposes a new framework to develop a value proposition by taking a logical, analytical, left-brain approach to solving the problem. This new approach contrasts sharply with many other articles and books that use an approach geared toward planners who exhibit more right-brain attributes.","Lecours, Mike, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Mar,2017

Assuming an average retirement age of 68, an estimated 8,600 financial advisers will reach retirement age each year for the next several years, according to Cerulli. To successfully exit a financial planning practice requires the owner(s) to meet not only industry regulations, but also their own retirement needs. Previous literature has indicated many rules of thumb in determining the fair market value of a practice. But limited empirical studies have offered analysis of these rules of thumb to help owners determine their succession or exit needs. The purpose of this study was to provide an empirical analysis of one industry rule of thumb: what is the relationship between the selling revenue multiple for a financial planning practice and the revenue size of the practice?","Chien, Chia-Li, CFP®, PMP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Mar,2017

The first is an assets-only approach to build a total returns investment portfolio. Two additional methods put the retirement liability (meeting an ongoing spending goal in retirement) at the forefront and will try to choose bonds to best protect the spending plan from interest rate volatility. These include matching the duration of bond funds to the duration of the retirement liability, and holding individual bonds to maturity to generate the desired cash flows to fund expenses on an ongoing basis throughout retirement. Bonds may provide other roles in a retirement income plan, such as creating liquidity for unexpected expenses. But the focus in this article has been on using bonds to meet expected expenses, and these are the three basic options available for advisers.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Mar,2017

Prices of bonds and stocks are much higher than in the recent past, suggesting a greater likelihood that portfolio returns will fall below the assumptions commonly used by planners. This study explored how lower expected returns affect optimal saving and spending during working years, retirement replacement rates, retirement lifestyles, and the cost of bequests. Future real returns on financial assets are an important unknown that may be seen as following a continuum from reasonably certain (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) to unknown (stocks). Advisers need to estimate future returns on riskier securities, and typically draw from past risky asset returns to project the future. Rather than set returns at historical averages, bond returns should be set at today's yield curve, and equity returns should be adjusted for the lower risk-free rate and reduced equity premium.","Blanchett, David, PhD, CFP®, CFA;Finke, Michael S, PhD, CFP®;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Mar,2017

Perhaps you are pursuing a graduate degree or have clients who are doing the same. Having an employer sponsor or pay for business-related courses is the best option for an employee, because those benefits can often be structured so they are tax free to the employee. Similar to work-related deductions such as business auto mileage and supplies, work-related education expenses are also allowable deductions. The lifetime learning credit and the above-the-line deduction for tuition and fees are also available for professionals with business-related education expenses.

JFP,Retirement Income Showdown: Risk Pooling Versus Risk Premium,"Different groups within the financial services profession continue to debate about the best approach to building a retirement income plan. Pfau (2014) identified two general philosophies about retirement income: the probability-based and safety-first schools of thought. A key issue of disagreement between these sides is about where retirees are best served in placing their focus and trust: in the risk/ reward trade-offs and upside potential of a stock portfolio (probability-based), or in the contractual guarantee of income annuities (safety first). This analysis aimed to test these competing approaches to provide greater clarity about the role of risk pooling (income annuities) and risk premium (stocks) in a retirement income plan. The theory for retirement income planning used in this research was informed from multiple sources. First, Branning and Grubbs (2010) proposed a framework for thinking about retirement income in terms of household liabilities and asset-liability matching. Retirees must decide how much risk to their lifestyle they are willing to accept.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Feb,2017

JFP,"To Enhance Lifetime Retirement Security, Use Reverse Mortgages or Immediate Annuities?","This paper reviews how reverse mortgages work, with a focus on costs, taxation, and possible use in enhancing lifetime retirement security through tenure payments. A recent article in the financial planning literature found that tenure payments from a reverse mortgage effectively and efficiently balance income and bequest needs of a retired household. For those retired households who have both significant retirement assets and housing equity, the question remains whether they should use reverse mortgages based on their housing equity or immediate life annuities based on their retirement assets. The answer lies, in part, in an empirical analysis done here with note of costs and current market conditions, using standard calculators. Results show that for three timeframes with different interest rate levels, the life annuity produced higher income for individuals of almost all ages and both genders in retirement, while for couples, the reverse mortgage produced generally higher incomes, although the income from the annuity improves relatively when the age spread among the couple widens and as they are older.","Warshawsky, Mark J, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Feb,2017

Without an adequate risk management plan in place, the benefits resulting from saving and investing to reach client goals for education funding, retirement, and legacy planning may be wiped out if the client experiences a negative risk exposure. A relatively new risk that business-owner clients are exposed to is financial loss resulting from a cyber breach.

Most importantly, you should be selective with solutions for LTC coverage and seek more flexibility than what is typically offered with the features of traditional LTC policies. Talk to your clients who already have ample savings to cover LTC, since they can use the life insurance to create a tax-free bucket.

However, lump-sum investing has not conclusively eclipsed dollar-cost averaging; it has outperformed dollar-cost averaging only two-thirds of the time. Certain periods of flat stock market performance, and downward-trending markets point to the superior nominal investment return with dollar-cost averaging. This study sought to identify an environmental pattern in dollar-cost averaging's higher returns over lump-sum investing. The investment returns of the lump-sum investing strategy and the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy were compared for rolling 15-year periods. Historic cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio metrics were sourced from Robert Shiller's webpage at Yale University. Ten- and five-year periods were also tested, but 15 years was used because it enabled the greatest chance for the outperformance by DCA.

Here are 9 things things clients need to know about you: 1. the key benefits clients receive, 2. pricing services, 3. services have value, 4. your service practices, 5. why you're an adviser, 6. your community involvement, 7. your credentials, 8. how you built your company, and 9. your business objectives.","Loury, Kirk",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Jan,2017
JFP,The Psychology of Communication in Estate Planning,"When people don't know a person's true intentions, they make up a story. They then convince themselves that their story is true. The story they make up is based on their conscious and unconscious beliefs about ourselves, their family, the world, their self-esteem, their perceived position in their family system, their relationship with their parents and siblings, and any unfinished business or emotional wounds they have experienced in relation to the grantor. Despite the universal need to disperse one's wealth and possessions in a thoughtful manner, only 30% of people take the time to establish an estate plan, according to the 2003 book Preparing Heirs by Roy Williams and Vic Preisser. Of these estate plans, 70% fail to accomplish the client's true intentions. Strategies to minimize taxes and avoid probate are just the tip of the iceberg; however, that is where traditional estate planning starts and often ends.","Klontz, Bradley T, PsyD, CFP®;Yim, Stephen B, JD, LLM",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,17-Jan,2017
JFP,Treatment of Inflation in Retirement Planning Calculations: An Improved Method,"A review guide for the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) examination includes the following statement: The client needs to make an assumption regarding the effects of inflation during the period necessary to accumulate assets, as well as during the distribution phase in retirement. This statement is consistent with the methods presented in a number of financial planning and retirement planning textbooks, but it assumes expertise on the part of the client, and therefore may be unreasonable. It is also part of what may be considered a convoluted calculation method that is not consistent with analyses by economists. The purpose of this article is to show that inflation is not properly discussed in financial planning and retirement planning textbooks and in the CFP examination, and that the calculation method presented in these textbooks is not consistent and may lead to unreasonable recommendations for clients. This article presents a simpler method that leads to more reasonable results, and is consistent with the approach taken by economists.","Hanna, Sherman D, PhD;Kim, Kyoung Tae, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17-Jan,2017

The rapid evolution of wealth management technology presents exciting opportunities for clients and advisers to communicate and collaborate without lengthy in-person meetings. Docupace Chief information security officer Tom Embrogno said that in terms of cybersecurity, advisers should start with awareness and training. If advisers understand the risk associated with the data they are in custody of, they can learn to look for weaknesses or backdoor errors within the system and correct them with several rounds of testing.

But before they get into his predictions, he would like to preface this commentary by pointing out two things: Brexit and president-elect Trump. One thing remains true about Brexit and Trump: both events will certainly impact the fintech industry in 2017. Technology will play an important role in complying with the new fiduciary standards set forth by the Department of Labor. These tools help advisers become more transparent with their clients.

Stuck in their status quo, they are unable to envision new possibilities to achieve what they want from their business. To maintain a sustainable business, you need cash flow to cover business expenses and the necessary personal expenses that your income funds. Revenue over that baseline provides for savings and retirement, donations, gifts, luxury personal expenses, child or parent support, and whatever else you choose. To increase your revenue, you must focus on marketing. Marketing is more than creating awareness to generate action; it spans from that first impression through developing deep client loyalty and inspiring ambassadors.

There is the technical aspect of succession planning that involves finding the right buyer, valuing the business, negotiating the deal, and executing the arrangement; but for many advisers, the more difficult aspect is accepting the fact that a long, rewarding career is winding down. To make a successful transition to retirement, it's important to address both sides of the equation-emotional and logistical. Once you've done the emotional and psychological work of readying yourself for retirement -- in whatever form it may take -- the logistical work of readying the practice for transition is likely to go more smoothly. Identifying your successor is the first critical step in the year or two after you have prepared yourself for a transition.

An advance medical directive generally has two parts: the health care proxy and a living will.

As a financial planner serving this demographic, it is vital to counsel clients and provide a thoughtful analysis on their retirement distribution options in order to maximize cash flow and preserve after-tax wealth.

JFP,Using Neuroeconomics to Help Clients Make the Right Financial Decisions,"Many clients became overwhelmed when faced with decisions regarding their investments, family security, or taxes. And sometimes, they avoided making a decision altogether, which put them at risk. As a result, financial advisers started studying neuroeconomics -- the combination of economics, neuroscience, and psychology -- and its impact on how clients make economic decisions. In order for the client to make a good decision, a direct connection between the financial information being presented and the area in a client's brain that can make the most sense of that concept is needed. The adviser must ensure everything comes together at that perfect moment when a client needs to make the right decision. Delivering a consistent client experience is paramount. A successful financial adviser knows that numbers are the means to the story. The story is about a person's life and their ability to make financial decisions to make it a better, safer, and happier one.","Hamowy, Charles, CFP®, CPA/PFS;Conigliaro, Christopher, CFP®",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,1,7,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Nov,2016
JFP,"Equity Yield Curves, Time Segmentation, and Portfolio Optimization Strategies","Time is a critical component in personal financial planning. Lifetimes can be broken up into a sequence of years, each with its own specific spending need. Good planning typically requires segmenting life on a year-by-year basis and taking appropriate actions to fund each year. Many investors must take on equity exposure to improve the probability of achieving a portfolio sufficient to cover lifetime financial goals. As with bonds, it makes sense that the equity portion of the investor's portfolio should also align with the investor's spending needs, albeit the longer dated spending needs. In this paper, three equity strategies were examined to determine which would be more consistent with a time segmentation approach and better support the goals of a financial plan and perhaps work better from a behavioral perspective as well.

It is understandable if these clients are anxious about being advised by professionals lacking hands-on experience with this kind of environment. This column will try to convey their concerns through a fictional amalgam. A number of things they might do to mitigate the risks: 1. Reaching for more yield in fixed income. 2.

Anthony thinks it's incredibly important to stay in touch with the changes that are happening and the nuances that are happening in clients' lives on sometimes a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. It's a myth to believe that discovery's an upfront process. The thing that drives him crazy about the ROI value proposition is that it's done on a comparative basis. It's relative investment performance. Now, return on life is getting the best life possible with the money you have; managing your money in a way that optimizes your life.

You can deduct the interest on your home mortgage if the loan qualifies as either acquisition indebtedness or home equity indebtedness. Acquisition indebtedness is a loan that is used to acquire, build, or improve your primary or second home. Home equity indebtedness is any loan on your primary or second home other than acquisition indebtedness. Both types of loans must be secured by your primary or second home for the interest to be deductible. Some tax planning considerations to keep in mind when advising clients are: 1. Couples considering marriage and home ownership, especially in high-cost housing areas, should be aware of the mortgage interest deduction limitations as a married couple and as co-inhabitants of the residence. 2. Amended returns can be filed. 3. Up to $100,000 of a home equity loan can be treated as acquisition indebtedness.","Welch, Julie A, CPA, PFP, CFP®;Smith, Cara, CPA, CFP®",1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Nov,2016

This analysis demonstrated the differences between commonly used Monte Carlo simulations that assumed a withdrawal based on a fixed mortality period and initial capital, versus a model that integrated an actuarial withdrawal methodology recasting simulations at the beginning of each year, and for each iteration within each Monte Carlo simulation. The new model, termed Continually Adjusting Stochastic Actuarial Model, or CASAM, provides the advantages of actuarial models that avoid failure while allowing the adviser and client to understand the variability of income that may result from risk of the portfolio or changes in time horizon through the model.","Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP®;Brayman, Shawn, MES",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Nov,2016

Communication skills are now well-established competencies for the profession, including assessment within the CFP certification examination. What most planners do not realize is that the literature on building trust and enhancing communication skills is based on serving typical North American clients. Those clients will change in the coming years, so planners need to look ahead to a broader range of skills that fit the clients of tomorrow. The demographics of the United States and Canada are changing rapidly as the world becomes more global.

Your clients may live longer than they expect. Popular discussions of longevity risk tend to underestimate it for three general reasons as it relates to the circumstances of your clients: 1. Life expectancy may not be measured from the relevant age. 2. Life expectancy may be calculated from current year mortality rates instead of projected future mortality rates. 3. The underlying population for which mortality and survivorship is being calculated may not be relevant for your clients. There are two general methods for managing longevity risk.

Financial risk tolerance is a more subjective measure that reflects an individual's willingness to accept uncertainty related to the outcome of a financial decision (Grable 2000). As an individual's comfort level with such uncertainty increases, their financial risk tolerance goes up. Risk aversion is another term sometimes used instead of financial risk tolerance. Risk aversion represents the inverse of financial risk tolerance. The more risk averse a person is, the lower their comfort level with financial uncertainty. The need for a financial planner to consider a client's financial risk tolerance is well documented in the literature and often required to meet various professional standards and regulations.","Ryack, Kenneth N, PhD, CFP®, CPA;Kraten, Michael, PhD, CPA;Sheikh, Aamer, PhD, CPA, CRFA, CFC®, CGMA®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Oct,2016

Work in retirement may be different or happen at a different pace, with many tenured advisers putting in fewer hours and taking more time off, including sabbaticals.

To see the value that goals-based investment management can bring to the table, it's important to first acknowledge the limitations inherent in current-day portfolio design.

Clients looking for the substantial deductions and the income stream available from a CRAT may be able to create one before the end of the year. Clients with taxable estates that include closely held businesses and/or real estate often engage in discounting strategies to reduce the impact of the gift and estate tax.

The general conclusion from this group of practitioners confirmed his academic colleague's conference experience. For the most part, financial planning research doesn't matter to financial planners. Here are three recommendations based on his observations as both a financial planning practitioner and an academic to help bridge the science-practice gap, so that they can ensure that their financial planning research does matter: 1.

As in prior years, the Green Book includes several provisions that affect insurance companies and consumers. Planners should be aware of these proposals and the potential impact they may have on clients. One proposal that could affect consumers of life insurance involves a change to the transfer-for-value rule. One of the benefits purchasers of life insurance receive is the ability to transfer the death benefit on the policy to the named beneficiary free of federal income tax. Upon the sale of a policy, the transfer-for-value rule is invoked, and the death benefit received by the beneficiary is subject to income tax to the extent it exceeds the owner's basis in the policy.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP®, CLU®;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA, CFP®",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,16-Oct,2016

JFP,Serving High Net Worth Clients through Wealth Preservation,"For many financial advisory firms, effectively serving high net worth (HNW) clients -- who are often a small but important segment of their client base -- is a top concern. Adviser-applied variable universal life insurance (AAVUL) is a relatively new tool available to advisers to help meet a variety of HNW clients' wealth planning needs while also creating business benefits for the firm. Some advisers have had difficult experiences with retail-priced variable universal life (VUL) products.

In US Trust's 2016 ""Insights on Wealth and Worth"" survey, 55% of HNW respondents (with at least $3 million in investable assets) stated that it's more important to minimize the impact of taxes when making investment decisions than it is to pursue the highest possible returns regardless of the tax consequences.","Loury, Kirk",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Oct,2016
JFP,Guardrails to Prevent Potential Retirement Portfolio Failure,"A primary objective of any retirement plan is to ensure that the retiree does not run out of money. To provide guidance on how to achieve that goal, numerous researchers have defined various safe withdrawal strategies, and financial institutions have created calculators designed to forecast a retiree's assets and income over time. And yet, better ways to manage withdrawals are still being sought (Updegrave 2016). The research presented here took an in-depth look at the failures arising from using several retirement withdrawal strategies. Failure scenarios describe situations where a retiree ran out of money. Examining these failures can provide valuable insight into early warning signs of a future failure. These early warning signs can then be used to establish guardrails that modify a retirement strategy by providing corrective action to avoid failure.

Fifty-three percent of pre-retirees surveyed by Nationwide Financial said it's important that their financial adviser talk to them about health care costs in retirement, yet only 10% of survey respondents said they have talked to a financial adviser about how to manage those costs.

JFP,Young and Indebted: A Closer Look at the Future of Young Professionals,"Financial planners can work closely with young clients to combat worries about planning for the future by following a few recommendations. Planners need to make themselves available, not just at universities or in the workplace, but also to high school students. Educating high school seniors, in particular, before they attend college can be beneficial because it helps them understand the importance of money and develop an appetite to save. With this exposure before college, they will be able to borrow wisely and not be in debt after they complete their undergraduate degree. Work with companies to establish ""just-in- time"" training sessions on financial planning topics for their new employees. This recommendation is perhaps best suited for planners who work in large companies or at government agencies. ""Just-in-time"" training is appropriate for new employees, especially when they are receiving a new salary and not sure what to do with their new income when it comes to retirement savings.","Concepcion, John N",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Sep,2016

The average age of a financial adviser, depending on what study you look at, is anywhere between 55 and 60. Over the next 10 years, more of these advisers will exit the profession than will invest in building next generation practices. It's hard to argue against advisers wanting to exit and take short-term risk off the table, because having a longer-term view requires greater investment and risk. More investors will need advice in the future, not less. More assets will be in play going forward, and even if fees compress, the firms with effective asset-gathering programs will be armed to gain a disproportionate share of the assets and revenue in motion. There are some certainties in the world: the sky is blue, and financial planning is moving to the center of the financial adviser's value proposition.

For women in general, however, the CFP certification is the proverbial light under a bushel basket: shining brightly but largely disregarded. The percentage of CFP professionals who are women has flatlined at 23% for the last decade. As girls or high school students, they probably never met or talked to a female financial planner. As part of its WIN study, CFP Board compiled a survey of the characteristics of men and women financial advisers and found that the average female adviser is younger, less experienced, and less entrepreneurial than the average male adviser.","Blayney, Eleanor, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Sep,2016

JFP,A Dynamic Yield Curve-Based Approach to Retiree Portfolio Allocation,"This study tested the hypothesis that an annual rebalancing of a client's portfolio would benefit from consideration of yield curve status when deciding upon the appropriate portfolio allocation. Results indicate that a simple dynamic reallocation strategy could help retirees increase their safe withdrawal rates considerably. An adjustment to reduce equity portfolio risk in certain years appeared to allow increased equity portfolio risk exposure in years in which the yield curve was not inverted, supporting an increased withdrawal rate. Using historical returns from 1926 to 2014, it was seen that when a valuation-based strategy that employed the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio to inform the annual portfolio rebalancing was combined with reducing equity exposure when the yield curve was inverted, the safe withdrawal rate was further increased.","Fink, Jason D, PhD;Fink, Kristin E, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Sep,2016

It should also include a shared understanding of our history; where they came from and how they evolved to look the way they do. Those first elements are well covered by academic programs and continuing professional education, but a shared sense of history fades unless periodically refreshed. It feels like the time for a refresh has arrived, and so the author is taking this opportunity to offer a concise history of the financial planning profession as he understands it. To better support and grow the young profession's body of knowledge, in late 1978 the ICFP founded a new journal, the Journal of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners, publishing the first issue in 1979.

Compared to the traditional world of mutual funds, actively managed ETFs are pathetic. While 78% of mutual fund assets are actively managed, that number is just over 1% for ETFs. Hardly worth mentioning. Studying where actively managed ETFs have succeeded is the best possible way to understand what active will look like in the future. ETFs operate in the market of the future -- one where products are bought based on their merits and not based on aggressive sales efforts alone. As such, ETFs are a canary in the coal mine for the active fund industry. And that canary has a lot to say. Here are four insights to be gained from studying the growth of actively managed ETFs: 1. Active is best received in illiquid markets. 2. Active works best in specialist areas. 3. Celebrity and style still matter in active. 4.

Equally important is retaining those new hires. The planner-client relationship is rooted in the trust that is built between the two parties, sharing personal history, and working together to attain the client's long-term financial goals. By adopting recruitment and human resource practices that appeal to millennials, financial planning firms can create a work environment that new employees won't want to leave. Here are some recommendations for hiring and retaining millennials: 1. Offer work/life balance. 2. Define job expectations and growth opportunities. 3. Screen candidates for compatibility. 4.

Although many people will remember it as Barack Obama's first day as president of the US, he will remember it as witnessing one of the most bizarre tax situations he has ever come across in his 14 years practicing as a CFP professional. On that cold January morning, a middle-aged prospect entered my office with a shoebox full of her financial paperwork. They sorted through the mess and conversed about her goals. He kindly advised the prospect that she needed to go see a CPA to help her with this problem. This was above his pay grade. They often hear more about high-profile tax dodgers rather than the average citizen. Tax evaders often face large criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, as well as civil penalties.

JFP,A Quiet Advocacy: Preparing Clients for a Change in Tax Filing Status,"Financial planners sometimes describe themselves as advocates for their clients. In such a capacity, they advocate for current decisions and strategies that clients in their future life would want themselves to follow today if only they knew now what they will know then. Of course, none of them can know today what them will tomorrow; however, they can certainly advocate for the positions in which their clients might hope to find themselves. As all US financial planners know, a single taxpayer reaches each tax bracket at a far lower income than a taxpayer who is a married couple filing jointly. Most importantly, this happens twice as quickly when moving from the 15% federal bracket to the next bracket, 25%. It's the biggest jump in the tax code.

The endless -- and seemingly increasing -- stream of media and industry coverage about empowering next gen advisers and serving next gen clients, not to mention the money being thrown at next gen technology, continues to confirm that efforts to tackle this giant opportunity are, in fact, here to stay. Financial planners are admirably driven to provide the best advice and service to clients, however, when it comes to developing a new venture, it often becomes critical to embrace the entrepreneur's popular rallying cry, ""Fail fast and fail often."" One of the fundamental challenges intrapreneurs often face is organizational resistance to anything that even remotely resembles change.

JFP,Financial Planner Use Among Black and Hispanic Households,"This study investigated possible explanations for the fact that Black and Hispanic households are underrepresented among financial planning professionals and consumers by determining whether Black and Hispanic households differ from White households in their preferences for financial service professionals. Descriptive results highlight the large differences in financial assets and net worth between racial/ ethnic groups and other characteristics that are known to be predictors of financial service use. Multivariate analyses show that while there are generally not racial/ethnic differences in preferences for type of financial service professionals, Black households are significantly different in their use of financial planners; they are significantly more likely to use financial planners compared to all other racial/ethnic groups when controlling for other household characteristics. Results indicate that the popular assets under management fee structure may inadvertently be preventing Black and Hispanic households from using financial planners. Adopting alternative fee structures, such as monthly retainers, may be a way to increase financial planner use among Black and Hispanic households.","White, Kenneth J, Jr, PhD;Heckman, Stuart J, PhD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Sep,2016

Most importantly, you can create an IPS to set clear expectations with clients and all parties in regard to the philosophies, policies, investment objectives, and risk parameters that will guide the investment of the client's liquid wealth. Trustees of irrevocable trusts must follow the Uniform Prudent Investor Act tenets, stating trustees are required to pursue an investment strategy that accounts for factors such as risk and return. The IPS develops a systematic investment discipline for the trustee and investment adviser to follow and can discourage the trustee or fiduciary from making emotional decisions as a result of turbulent market conditions.

JFP,Financial Advisers Can't Overlook the Prudent Investor Rule,"To protect the integrity of financial advice to retirement savers, in April the Department of Labor (DOL) promulgated a rule that imposes fiduciary status under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) on any person who provides investment advice or recommendations to an IRA owner or to a retirement plan beneficiary. The DOL's main rationale for expanding the scope of ERISA fiduciary status was to impose the fiduciary duty of loyalty on financial advisers to retirement savers, obligating those advisers to give financial advice that is unaffected by the personal financial interests of the adviser. The purpose of this article is to highlight the DOL's imposition of the trust law duty of care, and so the prudent investor rule, on financial advisers to retirement savers. In brief, the prudent investor rule codifies the essence of modern portfolio theory. The core teaching of portfolio theory is that an investor should maintain a well-diversified portfolio with a level of risk and return matched to her particular circumstances.","Schanzenbach, Max M, PhD, JD;Sitkoff, Robert H, JD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Aug,2016
JFP,What Impact Could the DOL Rule Have on the Mutual Fund Industry?,"Although much of the news following the announcement of the Department of Labor's Conflict of Interest Final Rule has focused on the adviser component of the equation, another component that deserves discussion is the impact the fiduciary rule may have on financial product providers. Although the fiduciary rule does allow advisers to receive commission-based compensation and/or indirect income by way of revenue-sharing provisions allowed through certain mutual fund share classes, there's some question as to how long that will be the case. Direct compensation seems to be the direction the industry is headed, and indirect forms of compensation could be challenged in the future. The most common form of indirect compensation is through mutual funds, the 12b-1 fee, which was created through the auspices of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The 12b-1 application provided a way for mutual fund companies to compensate a third party for performing tangible service functions that they otherwise would be delivering themselves.","Coté, Thomas P",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Aug,2016
JFP,The Intertemporal Persistence of Risk Tolerance Scores,"Before moving forward, it is important to clearly define what is meant by the term financial risk tolerance. The International Organization for Standardization (2006) concluded that financial risk tolerance is the extent to which someone is willing to experience a less favorable outcome in the pursuit of an outcome with more favorable attributes. The key word in the definition is willingness, which is someone's degree of readiness to engage in behavior. Whether a person's willingness to engage in a risky behavior is a relatively fixed dimension of personality or a transient emotional disposition is a question that has been widely debated in the financial planning literature. Some have argued that people have a natural tendency to perceive situations in a certain way that influences their willingness to take risks. As previously noted, the stability and persistence of financial risk tolerance scores across time continues to be debated within the financial planning profession.","Grable, John E, PhD, CFP®;Heo, Wookjae, PhD;Kruger, Michelle",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Aug,2016

JFP,Path Toward a True Profession,"The Department of Labor's (DOL) fiduciary rule is elegant in its core provisions, yet fraught with danger for those who ignore its tough requirements when providing conflicted advice. Should the fiduciary rule survive judicial and political challenges, it promises to propel the financial planning community closer to status as a true profession with its foundation firmly rooted in the provision of objective advice and counsel. Various class exemptions then seek to accommodate a variety of ways broker-dealers, insurance companies, and their representatives receive compensation from product manufacturers, primarily through the Best Interest Contract Exemption, or BICE, in which the ""best interests"" fiduciary standard is applied. The DOL specifically noted that full disclosure is not a defense to making an imprudent recommendation or favoring one's own interests at the Retirement Investor's expense.","Rhoades, Ron A, JD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Aug,2016

They need to make sure that they don't live so much for the future that they miss living for today. In Seattle, several members of the FPA Retirement Planning Knowledge ad the opportunity to get together in person to meet and share ideas.

JFP,New Approaches to Retirement Income: An Evaluation of Combination Laddered Strategies,"The use of life annuities for retirement account assets by participants in qualified plans and holders of deductible and rollover individual retirement accounts (IRA) is of great interest to analysts, policymakers, and advisers. With the decline in automatic annuitization from defined benefit pension plans, many are concerned about the financial security of retirees -- that retirees receive continual income payments over increasingly longer lifetimes. Experts recognize, however, that voluntary full and total annuitization may be an unrealistic and even inappropriate goal for most retired households. Therefore, partial annuitization strategies need to be fully explored. This paper builds on prior, related research to show the advantage of a broad genus of partial annuitization combination strategies using systematic withdrawals from a dynamically changing investment portfolio together with the laddered purchases of immediate life annuities over an extended period of time.

In the wake of the Great Depression that devastated the financial wherewithal of individuals in the US, Congress created laws to protect the financial security of its citizens.

This was followed by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Similar to the initial passing of ERISA, a confluence of financial challenges and court decisions caused the DOL in October 2010 to propose amendments to the 1975 regulations. The DOL had concerns that conflicts of interest may compromise advice given to retirement plans and IRA investors.

The more you trust someone, the more you can be hurt by them -- emotionally, physically, financially, etc. The most egregious breaches of trust by family members generally stand alone in their emotional impact. But the depth and breadth of damage that can be inflicted from betrayals by professional advisers can be even more devastating. In Roman times, the fiduciary standard began to crystalize and take a form easily recognized in today's standard. The term ""fiduciary"" originated in Roman law and means a person holding the character of a trustee, or a character analogous to a trustee, in respect to the trust and confidence involved in it and the scrupulous good faith and candor it requires. Perversely, financial advisers have the least consistent and rigorous system of holding practitioners accountable as fiduciaries.","Aikin, Blaine F, CFP®, CFA, AIFA®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,16-Aug,2016
JFP,Modern Investing Trends Reframe Active vs. Passive Debate,"Current trends in asset management and within the ETF space indicate that the active versus passive management debate may soon become outdated. New strains of investment products seek to combine the attributes of active and passive management so that investors benefit from active management in the more flexible, transparent, and cost-efficient manner associated with passive management. Advisers can demonstrate their value by explaining how certain products attempt to combine the best characteristics of active and passive management, and working with clients to determine whether or not the products in question are worth their fees given performance history, potential for alpha generation, correlations to other asset classes, and client goals and time horizons. The rise of smart beta ETFs is one of many trends spurred by the financial crisis of 2008, when investors saw firsthand that traditional asset allocation strategies and investment approaches could not adequately protect them in extreme market conditions.","Clift, Tim",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Aug,2016
JFP,Which Financial Advice Topics Are Positively Associated with Financial Satisfaction?,"Financial satisfaction is an indicator of consumer financial well-being that is an important component of overall life satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between financial advice topics and financial satisfaction. This study used data from the 2012 National Financial Capability Study, which asked more than 25,000 respondents nationwide whether they received financial advice from any financial service professional in the last five years. Results of t-tests showed that respondents who received financial advice on all financial topics except debt counseling, compared to those who did not receive advice, scored higher on financial satisfaction. Multiple regression analysis findings indicated that, controlling for several demographic and financial variables, advice on investments and taxes was positively associated with financial satisfaction. Financial planners may consider combining topics that may have potentially negative connotations with advice on investments and taxes to generate client satisfaction or reduce client dissatisfaction.","Xiao, Jing Jian, PhD;Porto, Nilton, PhD",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jul,2016

Fifty years ago there were five television channels; today there are 500. It is this proliferation of choice that makes focus and clarity so critically important in their lives today, and therein lies the opportunity for financial planners.

With yield-generating ETFs in the limelight, investors may wish to focus on high-quality dividend growers that offer sustainable payouts. Dividends are often seen as a reflection of confidence in a company's balance sheet, earnings, and performance outlook. Dividend-paying companies that have consistently increased dividends are ranked among an elite group of dividend payers and have outperformed those that eschewed cash payouts. Dividend growth stocks may outperform the broader equities market this year as a flagging bull market begins to peter out.

It became effective starting in tax year 2013. The NIIT is a 3.8% tax imposed on net investment income. The amount of net investment income subject to the tax is the lesser of: net investment income; or adjusted gross income (with some adjustments) in excess of a threshold amount. The NIIT applies to trusts and estates as well as to individuals. And with thresholds for applicability much lower for estates and trusts than for individuals, trusts are operating at a clear disadvantage. The NIIT affects both simple and complex trusts. Simple trusts are required to make income distributions to beneficiaries, whereas complex trusts can generally make discretionary distributions of income and sometimes principal, or they can accumulate income, adding it to corpus.","Welch, Julie A, CPA, PFP, CFP®;Smith, Cara, CPA, CFP®",1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jul,2016
JFP,Fear of Fees in Defined Contribution Plans,"Fees are a major theme when investment offerings, such as target date funds (TDF), are being vetted for defined contribution plans. Discussions are often anchored there, once fees come into play, and the subsequent bargaining may overshadow other important considerations. Among its tips for ERISA plan fiduciaries, the US Department of Labor suggests costs as the fourth factor to review, after understanding the fund's investments. For plan sponsors, however, fee consideration is often singled out as the most critical step to improve their fiduciary positioning. The fear may well have been heightened by the recent ""excessive-fee"" suits, including the Supreme Court's ruling in Tibble v. Edison International. Individual investment experiences vary, but this ordering of attributions held for the majority of cases, across various savings patterns, glide paths in TDFs, and levels of fees observable in the market. This analysis revealed that such security hinges on savings levels and investment outcomes, plus a containment of the effect of management fees.","Pang, Gaobo, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jul,2016

The techniques he was trained on didn't work, and it wasn't because he was a bad interrogator, they just didn't work. Any time that an individual holds back information, there is a trust issue. So if the financial planner is talking to a client, and that client's not opening up, it's because that client does not have complete trust in them.

Many advisers rationalize that a content strategy will not work and serve up myriad excuses to avoid this powerful and essential marketing. Here's how to quash five rationalizations and turn your excuses into action: 1. You don't have enough time. 2. If you get too specific with your target audience, you will pigeonhole yourself and lose out on clients. 3. If you give away too much information, no one will hire you. 4.

JFP,Capital Market Expectations and Monte Carlo Simulations,"One of the important and challenging aspects of retirement income planning relates to how taking distributions from an investment portfolio amplifies the impacts of portfolio volatility. Monte Carlo simulations can be used to show how the range of money-weighted investment returns gets larger in retirement. This has important implications about the choice for a fixed portfolio return assumption that should be used when creating financial plans within a spreadsheet. For a lifetime financial plan, the most intuitive way to express a portfolio return assumption is as an inflation-adjusted compounding return. Unfortunately, this is generally not the most common way returns are expressed. It is worth a quick review of the steps needed to arrive at a real compounded return. As for retirement, the impacts are even bigger, as sequence risk further amplifies the impact of investment volatility. Retirees experience heightened sequence-of-returns risk when funding a constant spending stream from a volatile portfolio, because portfolio declines imply needing to spend a greater percentage of remaining assets.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jul,2016
JFP,From Irrational to Rational: 6 steps to guide clients to productive decisions,"In modern society, money is the primary tool for survival, security, and satisfaction. Consequently, every primitive survival and pleasure-seeking drive is intensely focused on capturing and guarding money. These drives are involuntary and highly emotional -- they emerge more quickly and forcefully than logical analysis, making it hard for people to be objective. Here are 6 steps to guide clients to productive decisions: 1. Predict irrationality. 2. Listen for emotions. 3. Acknowledge and normalize. 4. Repeat the big picture. 5. Use vivid fluency. 6.

Sources of return remain key for investors, as alpha has been hard to come by. While the US presidential election is front of mind, investors continue to make decisions based on the low interest rate environment and other macro events until a candidate is elected. Simply put, for financial advisers making investing recommendations, there is no shortage of issues to be mindful of when constructing portfolios. In the post financial crisis world, central banks have taken on numerous tactics to stimulate growth, yet now those strategies are diverging.

O'Leary said one of his investing rules is to never own a stock that doesn't pay a dividend. Because he learned through experiences in his life that really profoundly changed the way he invests. His mother used to tell him and his brother to never spend the principal, only the interest. She's not a portfolio manager, but she had that philosophy of getting paid something. It turns out that dividends are the backbone of returns. And so, from that experience, he's just made it a personal philosophy. Diversification is the key when investing.

The following updates are noteworthy: 1. due date postponed, 2. Form 8971 is required only if Form 706 is required, 3. the ""zero basis"" rule, and 4. the ""subsequent transfer"" rule. The strategies discussed next apply to large and small estates before the decedent passes away (pre-mortem planning).

Understanding the three things that complement personality traits and the ""big five"" personality traits is the key to doing this. And the way to successfully help clients using this information is to provide a counterbalance to whatever trait a client is exhibiting.

JFP,Nurturing: One Way to Succeed at Succession,"Succession planning is an often-talked and written about topic for good reason. The baby boomer cohort is moving through the financial planning profession just as it is society as a whole. In contemplating practice succession, as with the financial planning process, it's important to establish and even prioritize competing objectives. Fundamentally, there are only two types of exit strategies: an insider transition and an outsider transition (with variations including mergers and roll-ups). Most advisers would prefer to transition their practice to someone with whom they and their clients are already familiar. Further, they prefer that the prospective successor reflect their values, philosophy, and approach. In short, they want to nurture their own successor. This approach may be most suitable for those with at least a five-year time horizon, a desire to build and leave a legacy, retain control, and even increase their income.

JFP,Understanding Tax Implications of Foreign Stocks,"Financial planners have a more difficult job in portfolio construction than non-client-facing money management professionals for many reasons. The most obvious one is that clients have a tendency to let their emotions affect their decisions. But intricate technical issues, such as tax management, especially around foreign investments, can challenge financial planners in particular. Most foreign governments require US brokerage firms to withhold tax on dividends that companies based in their countries pay to US citizens. Through tax treaties, however, individual investors can usually get the tax back if the asset is held in a taxable account -- but not if the asset is held in a nontaxable account, like an IRA or a qualified plan. Most countries tax dividends that their companies pay to foreign investors. This may cause US investors with foreign-based holdings to be taxed twice -- once by the foreign country, and once by the US.","Burke, John, CFP",1,1,8,1,9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jun,2016

Traditional research has focused on heterosexual couple retirement withdrawal rates. Same-sex couples naturally will ask if they can use the standard recommendations for retirement withdrawal rates, or if they need to adjust those rates to reflect the makeup of their family. This study explored systematic differences between heterosexual and same-sex couple withdrawal rates so that same-sex couples can adjust publicly available retirement withdrawal rate projections for their specific circumstances. Likewise, financial planners can use this analysis to help advise clients. Sustainable retirement withdrawal rates for same-sex couples vary in a systematic manner from withdrawal rates for heterosexual couples. However, because of life expectancy convergence at typical retirement ages, the differences are slight, and same-sex couples can reliably use withdrawal rates recommended for heterosexual couples with, at most, slight adjustments.","Mitchell, John B, DBA;Felton, Zachary S;Mitchell, G Thomas",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,1,7,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jun,2016

Without a willingness to compete, financial planning and wealth management organizations run the risk of missing the talent that can construct a retirement plan and the appropriate investment portfolio for clients. Your profession will thrive only if you retain talent that can properly serve your clients.","Beach, Steven L, CIPM",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jun,2016

JFP,Understanding Medicare Traps for the Unwary,"As more and more members of the largest population wave -- the baby boom -- approach retirement, many are learning the hard way that failing to comply with the Medicare sign-up rules can be costly. One obvious item that should be on the checklist of everyone approaching age 65 is to sign up for Medicare to avoid the possibility of a lapse in insurance coverage or a permanent increase in premiums for Part B coverage. From the financial adviser's standpoint, those who have clients approaching age 65 must be conscious of the sign-up rules to provide proper service to clients and to retain them. Medicare provides government-sponsored health insurance for those age 65 and older, and for those who are on Social Security disability. Originally, turning age 65 signaled eligibility for both Social Security and Medicare benefits. Individuals approaching age 65 should consider their health insurance options and make informed choices about enrolling for Medicare.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,16-Jun,2016

JFP,Applying Behavioral Finance to Ourselves,"The field of financial planning is complex, and practitioners intellectually understand that they should be offering their clients holistic advice grounded in theory. Even when beliefs and actions may be very different among financial planning practices, many planners try to stay within the guidelines of theories they follow. Problems arise when market behavior and current events strain the theories and the nerves of the planner. It's easy to forget that practitioners are subject to the same emotional stress as their clients. In meetings, they remind their clients of the importance of ""staying the course,"" but in practice, they may have trouble doing it themselves. A financial planner who is faced with a stressful situation can more easily engage a proven theory base by simply slowing down, avoiding the first behavior that springs to mind, and letting system two make a logical judgment.","Doviak, Peggy, PhD, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jun,2016
JFP,Redo Strategies: When Can You Redo a Prior Social Security Claiming Decision?,"Financial planners should be aware of opportunities their clients have to redo a prior Social Security claiming decision when such a change would improve their retirement prospects. One reason a client may wish to redo a prior decision is a change in personal circumstances. In this study, three strategies for redoing a client's prior Social Security claiming decision are explained. For each strategy, the appropriate Social Security terminology is presented so your client can effectively communicate with Social Security Administration (SSA) personnel. The three basic redo strategies are: 1. The one-time right to withdraw an application for retirement benefits if done within 12 months of beginning benefits. 2. The right to suspend retirement benefits at FRA or later to earn delayed retirement credits. 3. The right to suspend disability benefits at FRA or later to earn delayed retirement credits. Separately, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 includes significant changes to Social Security rules.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA;Meyer, William",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jun,2016

JFP,Dick Wagner on Why Financial Planning Is the Most Important Profession of the Century,"In an interview, Richard Wagner, author, speaker, thought leader, and financial futurist, talked about why financial planning is the ,most important profession of the century. For planners, Wagner thinks there are actually two key points. One is that money is the most powerful and pervasive secular force on the planet, which speaks to huge responsibility. Economic prosperity was a big deal, but it was not based on money the same way as it is today, where money is really the only source of, at some level, determining well-being and wealth. The whole concept of ""what is wealth"" is one that needs to be addressed as well. The mission and purpose of financial planning is to work with individuals. and families and their personal relationships with money and the fearsome forces that it generates. The Department of Labor fiduciary standard is about holding somebody's best interest to heart. He finds words like ""best interest"" to be pretty ambiguous, so he'd rather use ""trust"" and ""confidence.""","Yeske, Dave, DBAC, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-May,2016

When it comes to new technology, there is always a mad rush and few winners remain. Robos are no different. As a matter a fact, the concept of robos is nothing new. Today's robo-adviser is simply the same wealth management engine that professional advisers have used with a highly simplified interface, but with very limited investment solutions. Understanding how today's robos may impact the broader wealth management business may help maintain consistent revenue. As various robo platforms are trying to find a place in the market, some are starting to sell their technology as a solution. However, remember that the individual financial adviser or firm would be responsible for managing risk and investments.","Bhatnagar, Ash, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-May,2016

JFP,The Risks of De-Risking,"De-risking usually takes the form of reducing a portfolio's allocation to equities below the level that would be typical of the investor's financial situation. There are certain risks associated with this tactic, some long known, and some new and unique to today's market conditions. To begin with, de-risking may take the equity allocation below a level that would be considered prudent for a given investor's long-term financial well-being. Cash is the probably the single-worst asset class one could choose if the goal is to protect the economic value (the purchasing power) of the portfolio. De-risking into cash can be self-destructive and therefore a risk not worth taking. The best way to de-risk the portfolio in the current environment is to not decrease the equity allocation at all, but to replace a material portion of traditional equities with their risk-managed counterparts.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFP®, CFA, FCAS, MAAA, CERA;Chow, Gladys, CIMA®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-May,2016

If you're an adviser dealing with business owners, knowing the subtle difference is extremely important. Certain aspects of the plans are often misunderstood -- like the 25% tax penalty if you make a withdrawal within two years from when you first participated in the SIMPLE IRA plan, or the ""still working exception"" associated with employer plans. Contribution limits and allowable contributions differ dramatically between traditional and Roth IRAs, SEPs, and SIMPLE IRAs. SIMPLE IRAs and SEP IRAs follow the same required minimum distribution rules as traditional IRAs. While there's a ""still working"" exception for a 401(k) and other employer plans, this is one area where SEPs and SIMPLE IRAs do not follow plan rules, but rather IRA rules.","Harris, Bill, CFP®",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-May,2016

Blanchett's work rises from ""nice-to-know"" to ""big deal"" status because most empirically based safe withdrawal strategies take a static approach to spending which assumes that retirees need to increase their spending by inflation in each and every year of retirement. In reality, they don't. Blanchett's research into actual retiree spending patterns, coupled with the research around dynamic retirement distribution strategies and spending policies, means that retirees can enjoy sustainable retirement lifestyles with higher incomes and/or lower asset totals and/or earlier retirement dates than the plethora of static-approach withdrawal research would otherwise have them believe.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-May,2016

None of the benefits are taxable at low levels of income, but up to 85% of the SSBs are taxable at higher levels of income. At intermediate levels of income, where the SSBs' taxability is phasing in but has not reached the maximum 85%, additional income causes additional SSBs to be taxable, a phenomenon that has been dubbed the ""tax torpedo"". This paper analyzed the joint effect of these two factors. It shows that the additional SSBs that are taxable because of an additional dollar of income generates an additional tax that ranges from zero to 21.25 cents. The portion of SSBs that are taxable depends in part on an amount referred to as provisional income (PI). PI equals modified adjusted gross income plus one-half of the SSBs received.","Geisler, Greg, PhD;Hulse, David S, PhD",1,1,10,1,11,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-May,2016

This article gives the financial professional insight into the often irreversible consequences of providing and paying for care. The article has two goals: to give compelling reasons why you should proactively engage your client on the subject; and to suggest an innovative approach to discussing those consequences in a manner that compels the individual to take action.

Disability can be a financially catastrophic event for households. According to the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, the median income for US households was $46,700. Disability risk exposures can be managed by retaining the risk, transferring the risk, and, to some extent, reducing the risk.

JFP,Incorporating Home Equity into a Retirement Income Strategy,"The use of a reverse mortgage to supplement portfolio withdrawals as a part of retirement income strategy is a fascinating topic and a number of counterintuitive findings are slowly entering into the financial planning profession. For most Americans, home equity and Social Security benefits represent the two biggest assets on the household balance sheet, frequently dwarfing the available amount of financial assets. Even for wealthier clients, home equity is still a significant asset that should not automatically be lumped into a limiting category of last-resort options once all else has failed. Past studies generally struggled with how to explain the combined impacts of home equity use on sustaining a retirement spending goal as well as preserving assets for legacy. When describing the impacts on legacy, past studies generally focused on the median amount of legacy wealth and struggled with how to make proper comparisons in cases when the full spending goal was not met.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Apr,2016

Know that access to trust property by the beneficiaries should be limited to maximize asset growth potential and preserve principal for future heirs. Advise your grantor clients to decide how narrow or broad their beneficiaries' access will be within those limits. Prepare a mission statement to identify your clients' family values. Realize that wealthy families should pass along the family vision for their assets even when the operation of a business is no longer a concern. Dynasty trusts may drain the initiative of your grantor clients' children or grandchildren to work, since they will receive continuous trust income.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP®, CTFA, AEP®",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Apr,2016

JFP,How to Incorporate College Planning into Your Practice,"The cost of college has outpaced inflation, and student debt is rising at an alarming rate; families are looking for help. The problem is, college funding is complicated and it has its own language. In addition, colleges are great marketers to emotional adolescents and their parents. Everyone is familiar with academic reach, but no one discusses financial reach. Maybe that is why the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that US student loan debt is more than $1.2 trillion dollars. From a financial adviser's standpoint, financial planning for college is an underserved market for various reasons. More clients are expecting their financial advisers to provide advice on college financial decisions. Here is a list of a few college planning strategies and ideas to incorporate into your financial planning practice: 1. Address complexity. 2. Develop a college funding approach. 3.

JFP,Improving Withdrawal Rates in a Low-Yield World,"Determining an appropriate withdrawal rate from their investment portfolios is one of the biggest investment or financial planning decisions retirees will make. Prior research indicates that a portfolio of 50% stocks and 50% bonds is capable of supporting an initial withdrawal rate of 4% (with the dollar amount subsequently adjusted for inflation). Bengen (1994) showed that a 4% initial withdrawal rate failed in 0% of historical simulations. In addition, using Monte Carlo simulations, with capital market expectations equal to the historical averages, the 4% initial withdrawal rate failed in only 6% of the simulations. One way to increase the safe withdrawal rate of a portfolio is to decrease the allocation to bonds and increase the allocation to stocks. Unfortunately, increasing the allocation to stocks dramatically changes the risk profile of the portfolio by increasing the standard deviation of returns and increasing the maximum drawdown.","Miller, Andrew, CFA, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Apr,2016

JFP,Propensity to Plan: A Key to Health and Wealth?,"This article describes a study of the relationship of a self-reported planning behavior and the frequency of performance of positive health and financial management practices. The study uses data from an online survey of personal health and financial practices to examine whether respondents who have higher health behavior scores also have higher financial behavior scores. The conceptual base of this study is the Theory of Planned Behavior, which links intentions to perform behaviors with attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. This theory has been found to be well supported by empirical evidence as a highly accurate reliable way to predict human behavior. Correlation analysis was conducted between the health and financial behavior indexes. The correlation was 0.46 at a significance level of p &lt; .05. This result suggests that desirable health and financial behaviors are moderately associated. Support was found for all three hypotheses in this study. Respondents who reported frequent planning behavior had higher health behavior scores than others.","O'Neill, Barbara, PhD, CFP®, AFC, CHC, CFED;Xiao, Jing Jian, PhD;Ensle, Karen M, EdD, RD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Mar,2016
JFP,Understanding the Line of Credit Growth for a Reverse Mortgage,"Although reverse mortgages have long had a bad reputation with financial planners and the public, new government rules and research articles from the past few years are causing many to take a second look at their potential role and value. Research published in the Journal starting with the Barry Sacks and Stephen Sacks article, ""Reversing the Conventional Wisdom: Using Home Equity to Supplement Retirement Income,"" from the February 2012 issue, reaches an important conclusion that there is potentially great value in beginning a reverse mortgage as soon as eligible (age 62) for those with a reasonable expectation to remain in their homes. The idea is to begin the reverse mortgage early, even if proceeds from it may not be taken out for many years. The reason for these conclusions relates to how the line of credit on a reverse mortgage grows throughout retirement. Understanding this detail is probably one of the most challenging aspects when first learning about reverse mortgages as a retirement income planning tool. This article seeks to provide greater understanding for how this process works.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Mar,2016

He is most proud of the research that he's done on the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis. This is a new view of financial markets that really looks at the economic interactions through the lens of evolutionary biology to try to understand how it could be that markets can be so important and work so well at times and fail them so badly at other times. The idea behind a managed futures strategy is that you're going to be following trends. So if the price of oil goes down, then you tend to sell it. If the price of cocoa goes up, then you tend to buy it as a trend follower.

There are emotional reasons why some people engage in destructive financial behaviors, and financial therapy could help get to the root of them.

Post-2008, the bond markets have become more transparent, but much less liquid. This has created a transparent but strangely fragmented market that resembles that for consumer products. Bargains abound, sometimes in small quantities, bonds go ""on sale,"" and close substitutes trade at different prices. The analysis in this paper shows that bargains truly exist. The yield-to-maturity pickups and price discounts in markets for the same corporate bonds were measured, and some causes explored. The analysis shows that, at any given time, an investor could be paying up to 5% more or 5% less than the fair value of the bond. The analysis also shows that the deals tend to be in premium bonds and in discontinued corporate names.","Dubil, Robert, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Mar,2016

JFP,The Expense-Performance Relationship (or Lack Thereof),"In this month's column, the author points out an econometric problem with the majority of the empirical studies that have documented a negative expense-performance relationship and what this means for financial planners when selecting mutual funds for clients. If the negative relationship between mutual fund expenses and performance was linear, as most of the empirical literature assumes, then financial planners should correctly believe that the cheapest funds perform the best, and therefore, they are the ones that would be most prudent to select for their clients. However, as Barber, Odean, and Zheng's analysis shows, the relationship is not linear. Therefore, what can be said about the role of expense ratios in the mutual fund selection process isn't that financial planners should seek funds with the lowest expense ratios, rather that they should avoid funds with the highest expense ratios. Barber, Odean, and Zheng conducted their analysis of the expense-performance relationship over the time period 1970 to 1999. The financial dynamics of the mutual fund industry have changed since then.","Nanigian, David, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Mar,2016

Although a referral for financial therapy may be advised, it is common for a financial planner to be the only professional in a position to identify and influence a financial enabling-dependence dynamic. Here are five considerations for financial planners who are dealing with financial enabling and financial dependence: 1. Recognize that financial help can hurt. 2. Understand the curse of too many options. 3. Acknowledge the curse of unstructured free time. 4. Rip off the financial band-aid. 5.

However, goals and objectives can change quickly with the changing circumstances of the grantor and the beneficiaries. And irrevocable trusts, by their very nature, do not change -- at least that's what they tend to think.

Contrary to popular belief, when life's circumstances change, there are ways to change the impacted irrevocable trust: 1. private settlement agreement, 2. decanting, and 3. reformation.

JFP,Spending in Retirement: Determining the Consumption Gap,"Much of the financial planning literature on safe withdrawal rates assumes that retirees spend a constant amount of money that is based on spending down (or decumulating) a percentage of accumulated investment assets. However, retirees seem to spend much less than theory would predict. Rather than spending down savings during retirement, many studies have found that the value of retirees' financial assets hold steady or even increase over time. This unwillingness to spend from assets can result in a gap between the amount retirees could safely spend and their actual spending during retirement. This study compared retirees' actual consumption to that available under multiple asset allocation strategies. A retirement consumption gap (RCG) exists where actual spending is less than available spending. By considering multiple asset allocation strategies, it analyzed what the RCG would be for retirees with varying preferences for market risk and income certainty. Results suggest that a consumption gap exists across all asset allocation strategies for those with financial assets at the median level and above.","Browning, Chris, PhD;Guo, Tao, PhD;Cheng, Yuanshan;Finke, Michael S, PhD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Feb,2016

One reason may be that the adviser doesn't have a consistent, efficient approach for summarizing the meeting. Several decades ago, medical professionals started using ""SOAP"" notes.

JFP,When Life Insurance Is too Good to Be True,"Tax planning often involves the use of creative structures that appear to comply with the tax laws while allowing a client the ability to achieve a desired outcome that the IRS and Congress may not like. Creativity in tax planning can, however, push the envelope too far, creating results that, while ostensibly in compliance with the tax rules, are too good to be true. Due to the tax benefits associated with the use of life insurance, life insurance is often used as a key component in tax planning. One example is the use of life insurance in a Section 419 plan. Section 419 plans appear to permit business owners to purchase life insurance on an income-tax deductible basis through an employee welfare benefit plan, and still retain tax-free access to cash values through policy loans and receipt of the death benefit free of income taxes.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP®, CFA, CLU®;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP®, CFA",0,0,9,1,9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,16-Feb,2016

Many believe that documents like prenuptials or other waivers are only needed by the wealthy. As a result, they often do little planning when a remarriage occurs -- increasing the conflict and chaos that often occurs when people die. Financial planners should make sure their clients understand the practical, legal, and tax impacts of an impending remarriage or recent remarriage. Because of all of the state variations, this area of law is even more complex than the federal tax code; 50 states have broadly different and constantly changing rules, exceptions, exclusions, and limitations. It also impacts far more families than state and federal estate taxes. But a central part of being a skilled planner is ensuring clients and their parents and close family members fully understand the practical, legal, and tax impacts of an impending remarriage or recent remarriage.","Scroggin, John J, AEP®, JD, LLM",0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,16-Feb,2016

JFP,Bridging Theory and Practice,"Financial planning is a relatively young profession. The relatively recent addition of college degrees in the field of financial planning has led to research written specifically for financial planners. The future of financial planning is, indeed, bright. However, there has been a long-standing division between those who conduct research in the field and practitioners. As the field moved more to a client-planner relationship, determining the scope of what you currently call ""financial planning"" was challenging. Best practices often came about through formalizing processes because they worked -- not because they were grounded in theory. And too many times, the theoretical world of financial planning, housed primarily in universities, has little impact on the practices of planners. Neither side appears to communicate well with the other.","Doviak, Peggy, PhD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Feb,2016
JFP,Adviser Technology: How to Focus on What Matters Most,"When it comes to technology, advisers can't help but feel like they're constantly trying to keep up with the latest apps, programs, and innovations. None has the time day-to-day to investigate each new breakthrough, and it seems that every month they're faced with the latest and greatest tech designed to help them move faster, serve clients better, and become more efficient and organized. Data is (or should be) available on-demand, and that clients have different expectations from their adviser today than they did even five years ago. Technology was meant to help them overcome these challenges and stay current with their evolving needs. If you're looking to upgrade your technology, keep in mind that what you need might be right in front of you. After you've determined what your challenges are and what you need to remove them, you may find you are better served taking better advantage of what you currently use.","Friedman, Greg, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Feb,2016

The impact on the stock market was also severe. For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a peak before the Great Recession of 14,088 on Oct 1, 2007 and decreased to 6,547 by Mar 9, 2009, a decrease of 54%. Bricker, Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, and Moore (2011) reported that the mean net worth of US households fell from $595,000 in 2007 to $481,000 in 2009. This study had the objective of estimating the impact of the stock market decreases during the 2007-2009 period on the total wealth of working households. By providing a human wealth-based framework of lifetime wealth shock, this study can help financial planners provide their clients better perspectives to prepare for future stock market declines.","Kim, Kyoung Tae, PhD;Hanna, Sherman D, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Feb,2016

JFP,Less Is More: Clearing out the Business Clutter,"Over several years coaching financial advisers, the author found that most find themselves with more than just physical clutter such as client notes and old newsletters. He believes there are four types of clutter. Physical clutter is probably the easiest to detect because it is physically present. Most financial advisers have some degree of physical clutter, but if it has taken over more than half of your work area, then it has grown out of control. Emotional clutter is much more difficult to manage because there is no visual component. It can be a task to consistently figure out where something should go, and that is why many advisers find themselves taking the path of least resistance and just forming piles with the intention of filing items later. Product clutter is the most socially accepted form of clutter. Some advisers even consider it a badge of honor to have hundreds of stock positions, numerous mutual fund families, annuities, and money managers to follow.","Finley, Daniel C",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jan,2016

As foreign central banks enact loose monetary policies to fuel their economies, and the US Federal Reserve moves to normalize interest rates, currency risk will be a key concern in international exposure. Nevertheless, a growing number of international stock currency-hedged ETFs can help access global markets while mitigating foreign exchange risks.

JFP,From Founder to Successor 8 areas to consider when planning for succession,"Most entrepreneurs dream of building a profitable business, enjoying autonomy and financial rewards, and cashing out untold wealth upon retirement. While researching the new book Success and Succession: Unlocking Value, Power, and Potential in the Professional Services and Advisory Space, the author and his co-author discovered several key items to address in order to ensure a smooth succession between business founders and successors. First, it's important to understand certain characteristics of founders and successors. When contemplating succession, each must understand the choices presented, maintain respect for one another, and cultivate a level of humility. Just like advisers analyze client assets and liabilities, they should also examine their own businesses ahead of succession. In a perfect transition, both founder and successor avoid extremes and adopt a collaborative approach based on empathy -- an understanding of the personalities that each embodies and appreciation for what each contributes.","Hummel, Jay",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jan,2016
JFP,Quantifying the Value of Downside Protection,"In the wake of the financial crisis and ensuing equity market collapse of 2008-2009, there has been a proliferation of strategies and products that attempt to dampen the volatility -- and in some cases explicitly limit the downside risk -- of equities. Each of these approaches has a cost, whether implicit or explicit, and some strategies are more cost efficient than others. A possible solution to the portfolio problem is provided by investments that attempt to manage equity risk directly within the equity investment itself. The authors label such attempts as ""risk-managed investing"" (RMI). This article outlines the various categories of products and solutions currently available, covering both volatility dampening and downside protection elements of RMI. it is important to note that RMI's ability to elevate the efficient frontier is to be expected. This allows financial planners the opportunity to ""re-risk"" their clients' portfolios.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFP, CFA, FCAS, MAAA, CERA;Chow, Gladys, CIMA;Eggidi, Rohith, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jan,2016

The study found that clients crave more knowledge, and many high-growth advisory firms are satisfying that craving by curating content and sending it out to current and would-be clients via social media, which is termed in the report as ""thought leadership"". Some of the takeaways include: 1. Clients are engaged online. 2. Clients are engaged in social media and they expect you to be, too. 3. Clients want education. 4.

JFP,Could a Health Savings Account Be Better than an Employer-Matched 401(k)?,"Health savings accounts (HSA), which require that an individual be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) to be set up, are quickly becoming very common. O'Brien (2015) reports that at the end of 2014, assets in all HSAs, both those provided by employers and those that are not, totaled $24.2 billion in almost 13 million accounts. Because they are taxed like a retirement account, HSAs should be compared to retirement accounts. Financial planners should always find out if their clients are eligible to set up an HSA and, if they are, make appropriate recommendations about funding and taking distributions from it. This article does not analyze whether an employee should choose a HDHP or a traditional health plan, if their employer offers both. Instead, this article provides financial planners with the tools needed to assess and perhaps recommend to individual clients HSAs as a wealth maximization option, where available. It also provides the tax-efficient rank ordering for contributing to HSAs, retirement accounts, 529 accounts, and for paying debts.","Geisler, Greg, PhD",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16-Jan,2016

""Dynamic Choice and Optimal Annuitization,"" by David Blanchett, looks at four different withdrawal strategies both individually and in combination. Arguing that the majority of research on optimal retirement income assumes all decisions are made at the time of retirement, he considers the potential value added with more active management.

Changing a part of the world that you care about and creating a living legacy is rarely easy, Cornerstone Wealth Advisors Inc suggested. As for the ""charitable venture capital"" comment, he simply meant that some charities view six-plus-figure bequests more like a retirement portfolio, rather than a chance to change the world in some way.

Financial advisers are experiencing a significant graying of the profession and many advisers are considering exit plans. But succession or exit planning should be a long-term process, not an ""OMG, you'd better figure this out"" moment. Successful transitions require scenario planning and strategic analysis -- looking where the firm has been and determining goals for the future. Forward-thinking larger firms are matching inexperienced advisers with senior advisers, where young advisers can be mentored and develop professional skills over a reasonable period of time, rather than simply throwing them into the deep end with fingers crossed that they can swim. What many don't realize is that the actual sale of a practice is a relatively simple transaction, but it can only happen satisfactorily as the culmination of several years of strategic preparation.

These discussions generally delve into the intricacies of approaches like ""file and suspend"" or ""file a restricted application."" The general theme emerging from these discussions is that at least the spouse with higher lifetime earnings should delay taking their benefit until age 70. The point is that greater emphasis should be placed on what happens in longer retirements, because the financial consequences are more severe, and this is when delaying Social Security will have a clear positive impact. The alternative to treating Social Security as insurance is to view it as an investment or as a gamble on how long one lives. This can be problematic. The investment approach focuses more on the break-even age for when it finally pays off to delay benefits.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Dec,2015

If you only have access to indexes through ETFs, implementing a few simple trading rules can help avoid price surprises. The rules are: 1. Avoid trading ETFs until one hour after the opening bell. 2. Avoid trading ETFs in the last hour before the closing bell. 3.

JFP,Innovative Uses of Variable Annuities for Legacy Planning,"Traditionally, variable annuities did not offer diverse and viable estate planning options. With older annuities, the insurance company typically kept whatever money was left in the contract when the client passed away. Now, however, you can have clients add riders to variable annuities that permit them to leave part of the annuity to their heirs, albeit sometimes in exchange for a lower regular payout. Seek the guidance of appropriate tax, legal, and other professional advisers when carefully assessing all income tax ramifications and legacy planning aspects of a variable annuity. Planning ahead with innovative strategies is essential to maximizing your clients' asset growth and wealth transfer. Think about a restricted beneficiary feature when your clients are concerned about transferring their variable annuity assets to spendthrift beneficiaries or heirs with limited financial experience or unique circumstances.

Planners plan for everybody but when it comes to succession -- and even retirement planning -- they haven't been doing it for themselves. The third reason is desire.

Growth arises primarily from the entrepreneurial spirits of people. That spirit can be inspired by great advice, fostered by a great culture, and unleashed by free markets. It is time, in democracy and economics, to replace the preoccupation with corporatist power with the celebration of human freedom. This is the revolution that financial planning brings, with its dedication to the client, that they know as life planning.","Kinder, George, CFP, RLP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Dec,2015

JFP,Do Fundamental Index Funds Outperform Traditional Index Funds?,"Traditional index funds (TIF) allocate investments in such a way that chosen firms have the same weight as they do in a price-weighted, capitalization-weighted, or similar measure of market behavior. Fundamental index funds (FIF) allocate cash in such a way that more money is spent on stocks with book value, cash flow, dividends, and net income characteristics that supposedly lead to higher subsequent investment returns. The potential advantages of fundamental indexing have stoked debate between supporters of traditional capitalization-weighted index funds and advocates of more recently created fundamental index funds. Using the universe of index ETFs and mutual funds with at least five years of data, this study documents the performance of FIFs and TIFs since the 2008-2009 market meltdown. Cost, return, risk, and risk-adjusted returns measures were used to compare the allocation methods. Authors found that index fund providers were able to increase return, but also added risk. Although risk-adjusted returns in general were insignificant, fundamental weightings tended to enhance domestic returns when the market advanced.","Chang, C Edward, PhD;Krueger, Thomas M, DBA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Dec,2015

In ""The Decision to Trust,"" published in the September 2006 issue of Harvard Business Review, Hurley discussed the 10 factors related to whether people will trust. Three of the factors relate to the individual and are the result of a complex mix of personality, culture, and experience (for instance, risk tolerance). Seven of the factors relate to the situation or the person to whom trust will (at least to some degree) be granted (for instance, whether the person being granted trust shows benevolent concern or is perceived as capable). The gap between moderate and complete trust may be an issue of fact (an adviser is not doing some of these things,) or of communication (the client is not fully aware of what the adviser is doing). Here are communication tips to enhance trust: 1. Be predictable. 2. Assume less. 3.

The main takeaways were that a high level of fund manager ownership, board of director ownership, a short-term redemption fee, a high active share or low R-squared value, and being unaffiliated with an investment bank are all positively associated with future performance. Since that paper was published, new research has revealed additional characteristics to consider when selecting mutual funds. In the working paper, ""Outsourcing of Mutual Funds' Non-Core Competencies,"" Christoph Sorhage compares the performance of mutual funds that administer their shareholder services in-house versus those that outsource these non-core tasks to external firms. He finds that funds that outsource all of their shareholder services outperform their counterparts by 39 to 253 basis points per year, depending on metric of performance and performance regression model specification.","Nanigian, David, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Nov,2015

Financial planning has naturally evolved from helping clients function financially to helping clients improve their well-being and quality of life, as evidenced in life planning, financial coaching, and financial counseling. Positive psychology has had a similar evolution over the past decade to explore how people can optimize their well-being to thrive, prosper, and flourish in life. Financial planning and positive psychology align through the notion of positive financial planning. Two client case studies illustrate that positive psychology can be integrated within financial planning in three basic ways: as a perspective and orientation to financial planning, as a source of scientifically based information to bring to financial planning conversations, and as a positive intervention to help clients move through financial and life changes to maximize their well-being.","Asebedo, Sarah D, CFP®;Seay, Martin C, PhD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Nov,2015

Unfortunately, most financial advisers are under the misconception that the more they talk, the more information they are sharing or explaining, and that that's a good thing. One of your main tasks as their adviser is to ensure that when you spend time with clients, that you are not just talking to them, but more importantly, you are listening to them. People don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care. If you are genuinely interested in understanding and you are truly listening to clients at this kind of level, they will realize that you do care.","Finley, Daniel C",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Nov,2015

You understand there is value participating in the social sphere, but you haven't quite cracked the code on how and where to invest your energy to make it pay off.

But too often it's just a buzzword without much substance. There's still too much duplicity, and people need to understand that. Trust actually counts more than results. Clients will hang with you through a few tough quarters, or longer, if they trust you. And trust is a two-way street. If you have people's trust as a peer, they feel they can trust you as a professional. Sometimes it's a long process. You may stay in touch with prospective clients for years before they say they're ready to do something with you.

This offers a significant opportunity for affected taxpayers to claim tax refunds from their resident states, cities, or counties. The Supreme Court's ruling opens the door to refund claims across the country, because cities and counties rarely allow credits for taxes paid to nonresident jurisdictions where a resident's income is taxed, and resident states rarely allow credits for taxes paid to nonresident cities and counties. Refunds for all open tax years (generally 2014, 2013, and 2012) are available. Those who extended their 2011 returns may have until Oct 15, 2015 to amend their 2011 returns.

Vertically and horizontally in the organization, every person in an advisory firm is on call to serve directly or serve the server. Service is focused on doing something for another person by lifting a burden. Five key elements are required to deliver empathetic service that, in turn, grow the business by engendering client loyalty. 1. putting honor in service, 2. authority to act, 3. CRM for workflows and tracking, 4. client feedback, and 5. service reporting. The experiences a client has in being released from big and small burdens become stories that are retold.

One of the paper's purposes was to re-validate the benefits of a valuation-based asset allocation policy compared to various set-it-and-forget-it glide paths. Understanding this additional contribution and its implications is this column's subject. Practitioners should be aware when your portfolio's fixed income make-up differs from the composition modeled in research on which you base retirement income advice. Remind yourself that the fixed income allocation's ""primary purpose is to defend against equity declines and be available to reinvest for better equity returns (via rebalancing), not to be a return driver itself"". Perhaps the current low need not be so concerning if a portfolio's shorter-term bond volatility is closer to that of Treasury bills than intermediate-term Treasuries.

JFP,Dollar-Cost Averaging: The Trade-Off Between Risk and Return,"Traditional modern portfolio theory is a static model with only one time horizon. This study extends this static model to a dynamic setting in which investors have to decide how to invest over time. This framework can explain why dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is so popular among investors in spite of the many academic studies claiming that a lump-sum investing strategy is superior. The approach presented here analyzes both the expected return and the standard deviation, showing that there is a trade-off between these two variables. Although the expected return is higher for lump-sum investing than for DCA, the standard deviation of lump-sum investing is also higher than that of DCA. Depending on an investor's level of risk aversion, an investor may not want to invest all of his or her money in risky assets at once. Instead, the investor may want to invest equal amounts over time to reduce the risk. Results suggest that despite the fact that it provides a lower return than lump-sum investing, DCA can still be an optimal investment strategy for certain investors.","Cho, David D, PhD;Kuvvet, Emre, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Oct,2015

As an alternative to failure rates, this paper suggests comparing the distribution of outcomes for spending and remaining wealth for different strategies, and calibrating initial spending rates using the following customized ""XYZ formula"" determined by the financial planner and client. This review provides a summary of research on variable spending by identifying and describing key representative variable spending strategies and classifying them into a general taxonomy with two subsets: decision rule methods and actuarial methods. Each strategy was simulated using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations for stock and bond returns. As a general distinction, decision rule strategies tend to put retirement income spending rules in place at the start of retirement, while actuarial methods allow for more revision over time for the expected portfolio returns and remaining time horizon.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Oct,2015

As part of this effort, they try to maintain close, collaborative relationships with key thought leaders in this area from other financial advisory and asset management firms, investment banks, and risk consultants of various types. Earlier this year, we introduced a bit more formality into these ongoing efforts by issuing a request for proposa to the aforementioned firms to see if there were any recent improvements in tail risk hedging that they may have overlooked. One major categorization of volatility is ""realized"" versus ""implied."" Realized volatility is typically the standard deviation of the S&amp;P 500 over some recent number of days or weeks.

And right now, they don't really want to work with human advisers, according to Go Banking Rates. They'd rather work with robo-advisers and other technological solutions.

JFP,The Tax Man Cometh for Life Insurance Death Benefits,"Planners and clients often take for granted that life insurance proceeds paid by reason of the death of the insured are exempt from federal income tax. That exclusion of life insurance death benefits from the definition of income is found in IRC Section 101(a)(1). Similar to most tax code sections, however, the exclusion of life insurance death benefits from income has its exceptions. In the case of life insurance, the exception -- called the transfer for value rule -- states that if a life insurance policy is transferred for valuable consideration, the death benefit becomes taxable to the extent it exceeds the purchaser's basis in the policy. Individuals who create small businesses jointly owned with others typically enter into buy-sell agreements requiring surviving owners to purchase their interest at death. Tax law is only as permanent as Congress wants it to be. Planners have been able to rely on the techniques described here to protect their clients through the use of life insurance.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA",1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,15-Sep,2015
JFP,Initial Conditions and Optimal Retirement Glide Paths,"The body of research exploring the optimal glide path shape for investors, both for accumulation and distribution phases of retirement, continues to grow. Traditional financial planning theory generally suggests that the retirement glide path should include an equity allocation approximating 100% minus an investor's age. Different approaches exist, but the optimal glide path shape is commonly assumed to decrease throughout someone's lifetime, meaning the portfolio should become more conservative as the individual approaches retirement. Retirees need to consider both initial bond yields and stock market conditions at retirement. In this paper, two key indicators were used to forecast the future returns of bonds and stocks; namely, 10-year US government bond yields and the Shiller CAPE ratio, respectively. Bond yields provide a great deal of insight to the future returns of bonds, because a majority of the return on bonds is the coupon, which is known at the time of purchase.","Blanchett, M David",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Sep,2015

JFP,The Next Generation of Communication,"Authentic communication cultivates productive relationships and can quickly transform a young planner into a business-generating machine. Focusing on this art, rather than simply hammering away at financial knowledge, helps remove invisible barriers that might otherwise derail fruitful relationships. Clients and referral partners latch on to someone who can blend authenticity and vulnerability in a way that shows confidence and trust. By focusing on building strong relationships via authentic communication across all mediums, up-and-coming advisers from the millennial generation can catapult themselves ahead of their peers -- and perhaps even more experienced advisers. The next generation of financial planners should be trained to build relationships first. Gaining experience takes time, yet learning how to have productive conversations with people simply takes practice. The financial planning industry must learn to be less controlling and salesy, and more generous and vulnerable if they want to expand and thrive. If they adjust their training programs to focus on communication and leadership skills, they will tap into a hidden realm of possibilities in millennial planners.","Roberge, Eric, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Sep,2015

Millennial planners entering this profession have graduated from one of the more than 350 CFP Board registered programs, and are fueled with passion. It is no surprise that technology is a part of the millennial DNA. Millennial planners committing to being practitioners are choosing one of two roads -- traditional or nontraditional.

By doing so, planners can help clients approaching retirement draft a strategic blueprint for spending from savings.

About 1977 marks the period that national high interest rates started showing up in participating whole life (PWL) dividend values and when mutual companies started providing a ""dividend interest rate"" figure. The primary insurance products sold until the early 1980s were PWL policies sold by the mutual companies, and whole life policies sold by stock companies. Early in the 1980s, universal life (UL) was introduced, offering buyers double-digit interest crediting rates (new money rates) that were higher than PWL's portfolio rates. Year 1993 marks the year when PWL dividends and UL crediting rates began to gradually decline as lower interest rates dug in. Around 2009, another new policy type became popular, indexed universal life, which promises that its interest crediting rates are determined by reference to the S&amp;P 500 stock index with no losses.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Aug,2015

As most asset classes -- through indexing and ETFs and mutual funds -- are very accessible for a super low cost. If you're doing buy-and-hold investing and you have some global stocks, some bonds, and some real assets, the exact amount doesn't matter that much; as long as you have those three ingredients, then the precise asset allocation becomes less material. Smart beta is a term Faber tries to avoid, though all five of the ETFs could be classified as smart beta depending on who you ask.

Qualified ABLE account assets are not subject to the current income tax and thus accumulate on a tax-free basis. In essence, the ABLE accounts are likely to be most appealing for those with disabilities who work and seek to save more than $2,000, as well as for the families who need a place to deposit gifts or inheritances from family members. ABLE accounts are not sensible for families who wish to fund larger dollar amounts on behalf of a disabled beneficiary over time in excess of the maximum account limit.

Individual client needs and the impact various products will have at the time of claim need to be thoroughly considered. Don't simply assume that one product is as good as the other. Do a thorough review of client needs and concerns, and educate them about the impact of the different long-term care products.","Peabody, Kerry, CLTC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Aug,2015
JFP,How to Evaluate Dividend ETFs,"With bond yields at record lows, investors are increasingly turning to dividend-focused ETFs as a primary source of income. More than 85 dividend-focused ETFs are now on the market with more than $160 billion in combined assets under management, and those numbers are growing. Here are a few critical questions to keep in mind when choosing these ETFs: 1. Are you searching exclusively for yield? 2. Are you looking for total return? 3. Aristocrats vs. aggressive payers? The most important thing to note is that even though these funds all have ""dividend"" in their name, the portfolios they deliver -- and the returns they promise -- vary widely.","Hougan, Matt",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Aug,2015

JFP,Volatility and HIFO Accounting,"Highest-in, first-out (HIFO) accounting is a technique used when liquidating shares in a taxable account to capture tax benefits sooner rather than later. This study builds on previous HIFO research by investigating the impact of volatility of returns on the benefit provided by HIFO accounting to determine if more volatile securities have a greater tax benefit. Results indicate that the effect of volatility on the total dollar benefit of HIFO is not always clear. However, when expressed as a percentage of wealth, above-average volatility increases the HIFO benefit substantially after controlling for return. While, on average, HIFO can increase wealth by about 1%, more volatile assets may have HIFO benefits three times as large. This study can help financial planners understand the effectiveness of a HIFO strategy and the benefit of locating high risk/return investments in taxable accounts.","Atra, Robert J, PhD, CFA;Pae, Yuntaek, PhD, CFA",0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Aug,2015

The author will update the study with data through the end of 2014, but then explain how this study is widely misinterpreted and can be modified to better reflect the reality meeting today's retiring clients. By mixing the S&amp;P 500 with long-term corporate bonds, the Trinity study calculated that a 4% initial spending rate, with subsequent spending adjusting upwards for inflation, would have survived in 95% of the historical rolling 30-year periods when using a 50/50 portfolio. Sustainable spending rates are tied closely to the underlying market returns, and with sequence of returns risk, the market returns experienced early in retirement have a disproportionate impact on the final outcomes. For today's retirees, the income from these broadly diversified investment portfolios will not be sufficient to meet a 4% withdrawal rate.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Aug,2015

JFP,Reassessing Risk: Considering indexed universal life as an alternative to traditional conservative investments,"When investing, people generally seek to obtain the highest return possible given the amount of risk they are able and willing to tolerate. Unfortunately, gauging the degree of risk associated with various investments is not always easy. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate carry their own varying degrees of risk and also lack guaranteed results, but many people consider these known risks, where they believe they have sufficient information available to confidently project future results. The lack of familiarity with life insurance as an asset class can prevent people from applying a similar, objective analysis to insurance products. Nothing in life is risk-free, and indexed universal life insurance products are no exception. Interestingly, though, the concerns about these products that are most often cited are ones that are (at least statistically) extremely remote. In an effort to demystify this conservative investment alternative, this article presents an overview of how indexed universal life insurance works and the risks most likely to impact performance.","Smith, Jordan H, JD, LLM",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,15-Aug,2015
JFP,A Fresh Look at Life Insurance in Periods of Uncertainty,"A properly balanced planning strategy can allow clients at any stage of their financial plan to capture the significant long-term appreciation of the equity markets while thoughtfully apportioning assets in cash or cash alternatives for liquidity needs. These liquidity needs start with death, continue with emergencies and the inevitable bear market, and extend to distressed investment opportunities such as buying a piece of real estate amidst a market crash. Life insurance is an asset whose unique and most important characteristic -- the death benefit -- provides certain cash to heirs at the policyholder's death. Traditional dividend-paying whole life insurance on its own can be a compelling asset to own in any market environment. When you factor in the benefits of its unique liquidity characteristics at death and during life, it can have a significant impact on an individual's overall portfolio performance.","Tiboris, E Peter, CFP, CLU, ChFC, CAP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Aug,2015

The first LTCI policies appeared just 41 years ago, in 1974. Compare that to life insurance, which has been around since the early 1700s. The LTCI industry is still learning and changing accordingly. Here are seven trends to watch about where the product and industry is headed in 2015: 1. Younger consumers are buying LTCI. 2. More consumers are partially self-insuring. 3. Costs and claims are rising. 4. Premiums are rising, but moderately. 5. Underwriting refinements continue. 6. Policy innovations are on the way. 7. Asset-based plans are growing in popularity. People are living longer, resulting in a greater likelihood of needing care. An unplanned long-term care event can decimate the most meticulous financial and retirement plans while placing enormous stress on families. Although not everyone needs long-term care insurance, they do need a long-term care plan.","Gordon, Brian I, CLTC;Gordon, Murray A",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Aug,2015

Crosby's one big lesson is, that in every market, you control what matters most. Most people aren't too keen on accepting responsibility for anything really, so what ought to be an empowering message is one that is too often ignored. The most important thing planners could be doing is to always be building up that money in the bank with their clients, so when it comes time for them to ask them to do something uncomfortable, they feel like they owe them one. Meanwhile, there's a lot of upside to crazy. What Crosby has tried to do in his own work is get away from pathologizing the idiosyncrasies of humanity, because when behavioral finance first came on the scene, it was all about, look how screwed up people are; look how flawed people are; look at all these ways they make silly decisions.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jul,2015

JFP,Reduce Retirement Costs with Deferred Income Annuities Purchased before Retirement,"Most deferred income annuities (DIA) have a relatively short deferral period, making them particularly appealing to clients nearing retirement who value the ability to plan on a fixed, nominal income stream after retirement. Unlike long-term deferral period annuities (longevity insurance) that are primarily meant to protect against longevity risk, a short-term deferral period annuity can provide a steady income to pre-fund retirement spending over the entire retirement life cycle. The purchase of a DIA before retirement is particularly valuable for clients who would have maintained a stock allocation lower than 70 percent. Retirees would have been better off without a DIA in simulations where portfolio returns are very high or when retirees die early. Findings suggest that short deferral period annuities can reduce the cost of funding retirement, provide longevity protection, and offer behavioral benefits to clients concerned about near-retirement market performance.","Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,7,1,9,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jul,2015

The anchoring biases of clients who resist sound advice presume intuitive knowledge or instincts that supersede the analyses of a fiduciary. Some anchors are formulated from people's personal experiences, or even passed down from generation to generation. Some are good guidelines, but others could get clients in trouble. Anchoring biases should be identified and periodically reviewed. Investors are people, and people have biases that they may not be aware of that could negatively impact their finances.

The adviser should inquire whether there are any particular clauses or language that would cause the trustee to refuse to serve. In certain circumstances, the best way to keep wealth in the family is to have someone outside the family manage the wealth. This reasoning leads clients to use financial advisers and corporate trustees.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Daff, Charles, JD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,15-Jun,2015
JFP,Strategies to Increase Financial Asset Ownership among U.S. Hispanics,"Financial planners should pay close attention to national trends in financial asset and financial product ownership. Hispanics have lower levels of asset ownership compared to other segments of the US population. Financial asset ownership is closely associated with family saving behavior. Financial risk tolerance, which is defined as a person's willingness to take on additional risk or uncertainty in exchange for higher expected returns, also plays a key role in financial asset ownership among Hispanics in the US. Networks of family and friends and cultural values are another determinant of financial asset ownership among Hispanics. Financial institutions and intermediaries, particularly those desiring to capture a greater share of the fast-growing Hispanic market segment in the US, can implement several strategies to increase financial asset ownership among this population group. Several of these strategies are: 1: Increase financial education and literacy. 2: Promote, support, and implement policies and initiatives. 3: Provide individualized and customized comprehensive financial planning.","González-Corzo, Mario A, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jun,2015

Although the investments field has a massive research base, advisors often must choose between alternative investment worldviews when considering client recommendations. People can agree that in selecting portfolios whose assets are held for a particular goal, you should consider time horizon, the importance of the goal to the client, and the client's level of risk aversion. Financial planners can get consumed with technology: simulation modeling, sensitivity analysis, hedging, rebalancing, tax location, and others, ad infinitum. These are important and useful tools, but some unresolved issues depend on out understanding of basic financial math. Most planners seem to agree that working to achieve client goals simultaneously has distinct advantages.

While investing appropriately is generally an important part of accomplishing a goal, achieving a goal often requires advice beyond selecting investments based on alpha and beta. Past research on the topic of goals-based financial planning has focused primarily on determining optimal portfolios to fund different types of goals. In contrast, the focus of this research is how to determine which goals should be funded, as well as how to optimally save toward goals over time. A utility model based on prospect theory was used to determine the optimal funding strategy for a household. The results suggest that using a goals-based framework to determine which goals to fund and how to fund them can lead to an increase in utility-adjusted wealth of 15.09% for a hypothetical household versus a naive strategy focused only on funding retirement.","Blanchett, David, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jun,2015

That's really different; it requires that if financial planners want to get in front of those people, they have to be creating content. The unifying idea of The New Rules of Marketing and PR is that rather than spending money on advertising and rather than buying attention for your business, you earn attention for your business by creating online content, which is free to do, that the people you're trying to attract will see, and that will help them make the decision to want to do business with you.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jun,2015

Therefore, the authors propose that planners also look for active management in bond ETFs. Choosing the right active bond ETF for your clients involves some research. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, so planners should look at additional aspects aside from the expense ratios and previous returns. Some key considerations in choosing an active bond ETF include: 1. the research and trading resources of the manager; 2. the benchmark of the strategy; 3. the overall level of risk within the strategy; 4. the sources of risk within the strategy; 5. other elements of the ETF mandate, including any guidelines or restrictions; and 6. the structural risk controls. Consequently, various active management strategies can augment total returns for active bond ETFs, even in a rising-rate environment.","Atluri, Pramod, CFA;O'Neil, Ford",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jun,2015

Ultimately, this is why clients hire planners. Most of them have these kinds of discussions with their clients daily. And they really matter. At times, they need to encourage certain clients to take action. Other times, they need to ask them to explore why they are making choices that seem personally incongruent. If they can connect clients to their money, clients will fully appreciate their value.

This article provides a brief history of the ABLE Act, an overview of the rules, a comparison with other savings options, and specific examples where ABLE accounts can typically be the most appropriate planning strategies. The funds in an ABLE account can grow tax deferred and will come out tax free when used to pay for qualified expenses for the beneficiary. One difference between the ABLE account and the 529 college savings account is that in a 529 account the owner is the donor and the beneficiary is the college student.

JFP,Reversing the Dialogue,"The author quickly found that the way financial advisers have been selling isn't working because what they have been doing isn't actually selling, but more like telling. So, as an adviser, the solution on how you get a client or prospect to buy with confidence isn't only about what you say but about the questions you ask so that clients or prospects come to the conclusion that they want or need what you are recommending. The way to do this is to reverse the dialogue -- determine the conclusion that you'd like the individual to come to and map out the questions you would ask, in reverse order, until you get to the starting point of the conversation. Reversing the dialogue works for a few reasons: it gives you a visual of the question path; it gives you an opportunity to get prospects involved; and it helps you systematize the process.","Finley, Daniel C",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-May,2015

Using high speed infrastructure and special, but opaque, relationships with some exchanges, some high frequency traders are able to glean order flow information ahead of other traders and profit from it. The current arrangement is beneficial for HFTs and exchanges, but detrimental for investors. A relatively new stock exchange, IEX, has taken the lead in devising a system that denies preferential access to any trader (including HFTs) by providing an order routing system that eliminates the time lags between when an order reaches various exchanges. This is changing the incentive structure for stock exchanges and many may change their behavior in the future. In the meantime, to preserve the wealth of their clients, financial planners are advised to route large orders through IEX. Small orders need not be routed through IEX, but one must take the precaution of using limit orders at the quoted bid or ask price.","Pandey, Vivek K, DBA, CFA, FRM;Wu, Chen Y, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-May,2015

The 2016 Green Book proposes several significant changes to tax policy that planners and clients have relied on for decades. Although it is unlikely that all of these provisions will be adopted into law, they may influence the direction of tax policy. Some of the proposals would have a direct impact on uses of life insurance in financial planning. Life insurance is used in personal financial planning for two primary purposes: 1. to hedge against the risk of loss of human capital, and 2. to enhance wealth on a tax-free basis. If some or all of the President's Green Book proposals are adopted into law, the demand for life insurance to enhance the family's wealth on a tax-free basis will likely increase. If Congress adopts the President's proposals, clients and planners will have to adjust their strategies back to the future.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA",0,0,5,1,5,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,15-May,2015
JFP,Confirming the Value of Rising Equity Glide Paths: Evidence from a Utility Model,"Rising equity glide paths during retirement can offer equal or improved financial outcomes compared with static allocations. This study confirms the work by Pfau and Kitces using a utility model of constant relative risk aversion. Increased pension income may encourage retirees to tolerate more risk with retirement savings. Increased risk tolerance entails larger planned withdrawals and/or higher equity allocations. As retirees age, pension income (in the form of employer pensions and Social Security) will likely become more important as financial savings dwindle. As a consequence, it is optimal for retirees to increase withdrawals as a percentage of the remaining savings and to increase equity allocation later in retirement. This finding aligns with the benefits of the rising equity glide path. Retirement withdrawal amounts have a larger impact on financial outcomes than equity allocations. Retirees should focus first on managing spending before trying to enhance performance through innovative methods of asset allocation.","Delorme, Luke F",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-May,2015

However, Katy Votava, founder of Good Care.com, said one of the greatest misunderstandings is really how high-deductible health plans and health savings accounts work. Also, Adam Beck, assistant professor of health insurance at The American College, some provisions of the ACA either haven't taken effect, therefore there could be a delay, potentially this year, in the change in the definition of small group market.

The CAPM says that there is a one-to-one relationship between the sensitivity of a stock's excess return to variation in the excess return on the stock market, and the expected return on the stock. But the existence of ""gamblers"" in the stock market creates greater demand for high beta stocks than for low beta stocks. The strong demand for high beta stocks from ""gamblers"" and borrowing-constrained investors combined with the tracking error volatility constraints faced by institutional investors make a compelling case for individuals to employ a strategy of investing in low beta stocks.

JFP,The Costs of Retirement with Different Income Tools,"In this column, the author looks at current pricing for each type of strategy to give advisers a better sense of the appropriate starting points and available building blocks for a retirement income plan. The three strategies for sustainable spending from dedicated income resources for a 65-year-old couple include: 1. Buy a joint/100% survivor's life-only single premium immediate annuity. 2. Buy a ladder of bonds maturing over the next 30 years. 3. Buy a ladder of bonds maturing over the next 20 years and purchase a deferred income annuity that will continue the same income level and trend in years 21 and beyond. Advisers and clients should evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each income tool when deciding which to use, and they may like to consider incorporating tools from each side that help manage different retirement risks.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Apr,2015
JFP,The Return on Investment for Delaying Social Security Beyond Age 62,"For individuals who have a realistic choice of deciding when to retire, and for those not being forced into early retirement because of lack of employment opportunities, poor health, the need to care for a spouse, or any other possible reasons for early retirement, the decision of when to claim Social Security retirement benefits should be carefully examined. The Social Security retirement decision can have a major impact on the future lifetime benefits and the standard of living in retirement. Using basic investment cash flow analysis techniques, this paper examines the rate of return on investment on delayed benefits compared to the increase in future benefits received as a result of delaying the start of Social Security from age 62 to age 66, and from age 62 to age 70 for individuals and married couples using the spousal benefit. This paper also examines the impact of the delay on the recipient's future standard of living as measured by the percentage of income replacement in retirement at various levels of earned income.","Rose, Clarence C, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Apr,2015

This year, in addition to their successful ""DJ"" television ad, which debuted in 2014, they are adding new print and online ads featuring ""extreme"" situations, graphically illustrating why it's important for consumers to choose a CFP professional when seeking a financial adviser. The ads highlight that CFP certification is the highest standard in personal financial advice. The public awareness campaign is slated to continue with periodic reviews by the board of directors.

JFP,Counseling a Client with Addiction: Tough Love Is Not the Answer,"Addiction has become the new taboo. Many planners are increasingly finding that their clients and their loved ones are struggling with this unhealthy, expensive, and often life-threatening disease. Their behavior effects everyone by inadvertently drawing in family, friends, and business associates. Naturally, it is the responsibility of the clinician and/or therapist to diagnose and treat such problems. However, financial planners and wealth managers play an increasingly important part in assisting families on issues of family governance, asset transfers, and philanthropy. In my opinion, turning a blind eye by encouraging ""tough love"" is not a viable solution. The best advice you can give is: don't deny addiction, don't enable it, and don't wait. By simply facilitating the difficult issues, planners will find that their clients will come closer to achieving their goals once they acknowledge the addiction in the family, and bravely, intentionally move together toward recovery in the protective provisions outlined in governing their estate and trust documents.","Seeber, Catherine M, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Apr,2015

There is no single license, designation, or credential with the rule of law behind it that lets a consumer know that a competent practitioner will provide actual financial planning and be subject to a fiduciary standard at all times. Hat-switching between an advisory role and a sales role is an epidemic. Regulators do not seem to care what a title implies. Holding out as a ""financial planner"" only triggers the need to register as an investment adviser representative. What regulators could and should do is at least limit the use of the title ""financial adviser"" to people who are actually advisers rather than sales reps, attach the title to a bona fide fiduciary duty, and ban hat-switching. Give the public a clear place to go. They need a safe haven. Moreover, they deserve one.","Moisand, Dan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Apr,2015

What's most compelling to the editor about peer-to-peer learning through FPA Knowledge Circles is the impact these groups are having on other learning opportunities at FPA.

Another hiring mistake is the firm or the firm owner becoming enamored with someone who is exactly like them.

Finding the right fit and succeeding in the profession -- that's a completely different story though. Firms need to offer an opportunity, and interns need to add value and perform.

Currently, the most common sources of employment outside the Social Security system include state and local governments that do not participate in the Social Security system, as well as postings outside the US. For workers whose careers have been split between these two retirement programs, the interaction of the two programs makes estimating a worker's expected retirement income more challenging, and these job switchers -- and the financial planners who assist them -- need to understand how non-covered retirement programs interact with Social Security in order to best prepare for retirement. By providing information sources and detailed examples, this paper aims to assist financial planners and their clients in this situation while providing guidance on how to estimate expected retirement income for job switchers.","Coogan, Laura L, PhD;Lawrence, Shari, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8,1,9,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Apr,2015

As the economies shift, some countries will lead while others are left to deal with unforeseen problems. Consequently, advisers can pick and choose their emerging market exposure through country-specific ETFs. Due to the uneven growth outlook in the developing world, advisers can overweight specific countries instead of taking a broad emerging market position. Advisers who want a more small-cap focus can also use ETFs to target the asset category, such as the Market Vectors India Small-Cap Index ETF, EGShares India Small Cap ETF, or iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF.

JFP,Break that Habit: How to Help Clients Develop Better Investment Habits,"Habitual thoughts and actions pertaining to the financial markets influence many poor investment decisions. Financial advisers can play a significant role in helping clients develop better investment habits. This is a value-add approach that advisers can implement to further validate their advisory fee; this is important because the message from the mainstream media is that financial advisers are not worth their fee. Teaching and encouraging good investment habits is far more valuable than a simple portfolio recommendation, especially because the average investor is unable to stick with an investment strategy for more than a few years. In this article, the author will discuss the psychology behind resolutions, which often has to do with changing one or more habits to obtain a better outcome. He will then explain the nature of habits -- how they develop and what steps are needed to change them.

For many young adults, exiting their college years and entering the workforce with sizable debt can be a life-long financial challenge. However, individuals with low income or high debt levels often benefit from income-based repayment plans. Repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs are scheduled to be expanded in 2015 and could dramatically change decisions about student loan debt. Payment amounts will be based on the ability to pay instead of the level of debt and interest rate. Families with children planning for college may have an increased need for advice because of the increasing complexity of student loan repayment.

JFP,Understanding: Behavioral Aspects of Financial Planning and Investing,"Investor behavior often deviates from logic and reason. From the financial planner's perspective, such factors increase the difficulty of comprehending clients' judgments. Consequently, appropriate financial planning policies can play a powerful role in keeping clients committed to a consistent and disciplined course of action and in avoiding such biases. Ignoring or failing to grasp this concept can have a detrimental influence on investment performance. The authors' purpose is to examine some behavioral aspects of financial planning and investing. They begin by differentiating between traditional or standard finance and behavioral finance and stressing the importance of understanding investor psychology. They then focus on how behavioral biases, emotions, and systematic cognitive errors can affect investment decisions. They conclude with a few observations about how understanding investor behavior can help improve decision-making processes.","Baker, H Kent, PhD, CFA, CMA;Ricciardi, Victor, APC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Mar,2015

She sensed a real hunger on the part of women to understand, but they didn't want to be intimidated, and they didn't want to be patronized as they sought that understanding. They wanted to be involved. Planners have to educate their clients about the benefits of financial planning, certainly, but also help them understand that it is a complicated and multidimensional practice. Women are apt to see the whole investment process as very arcane and way too complicated, when in fact there's a whole theory of investing that won a Nobel Prize that basically said, you don't need to know anything; you can index.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Mar,2015

JFP,A Captivating Idea,"Planners occasionally encounter clients with substantial family businesses. Often, these are closely and privately held companies, and can represent an outsized share of the client's wealth. Considered as a component of the family's overall investment portfolio, the enterprise is typically not only the largest but also the riskiest investment in the portfolio. It would, therefore, be prudent to explore effective ways to expertly manage the risk of that investment. In the authors' opinion, there is a particular risk management device that is very well suited to this task. It was developed decades ago by large corporations to provide themselves very customized and tax-efficient risk management, and has been increasingly used by small businesses for similar purposes. The approach involves creating, within or alongside the family business, a wholly owned insurance subsidiary -- a captive insurance company. What should be particularly noteworthy to planners, though, is this: beyond their risk management benefits, captives, if properly structured, can provide significant income tax, business, and gift/estate planning advantages to wealth management clients.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFP®, CFA®, FCAS, CERA;Chow, Gladys, CIMA®",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Mar,2015

First, study the subject and read in the field. From the readings, choose specific exercises or topics that you find especially interesting. Once you feel confident enough to use the exercises and activities with your clients, begin to implement them with clients whom you believe will be most receptive. When determining the kind of bias becomes important, drill down to the major categories. It takes more time to explain behavioral finance to existing clients than it does to add it to the new client onboarding process. Keep the conversation focused on how the client's belief or bias is affecting the current planning and investing situation. Try to find a money coach, money therapist, psychologist, or other professional who is trained to work with people and their money psychology.

This paper extends these analyses by examining an anomaly that is often featured in the popular press, but one that has not been rigorously tested. The financial press often refers to the ""Santa Claus rally,"" which has commonly been defined as the last five trading days in December and the first two trading days in January.

JFP,How Dumb Is Smart Beta? Analyzing the Growth of Fundamental Indexing,"In this study, after summarizing the fundamental index ETF's performance relative to the market benchmarks, the analysis starts with the decomposition of returns into the common four systematic factors: market, ""size"", ""value"", and momentum. This allows risks taken to be characterized by a fundamental index ETF by the factor loadings (traditional betas). This approach also helps identify performance attribution by multiplying the pre-computed betas by the realized returns of the factors, with the remainder being the unexplained alpha. This allows the source of a fund's outperformance to be identified, and the contribution of each fund's special approach to be quantified. The majority of reported outperformance is easily explained by market, size, book-to-market, and momentum tilts, with only pure style funds having some, and dividend funds having a large ""special"" component.

JFP,"Retirement Risk, Rising Equity Glide Paths, and Valuation-Based Asset Allocation","This study explores the interaction of two research threads relating to asset allocation in retirement: whether the optimal equity glide path should rise or fall throughout retirement (and at what pace those changes should occur), and/or whether retirement asset allocation should move up and down dynamically in response to stock market valuation extremes. The first research question relates to the appropriate default equity glide path for client portfolios during the retirement phase of the lifecycle. This analysis employed overlapping historical periods to simulate retirement outcomes for hypothetical retirees over rolling 30-year periods using different asset allocation strategies. Although the focus of the methodology was on determining the worst-case historical maximum sustainable withdrawal rate (SAFEMAX) for various allocation strategies across starting valuation environments, such an approach focuses specifically on the strategies that minimize risks in the worst outcomes. It does not necessarily address how wealth may be impacted in more favorable retirement sequences.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP®, CLU®, ChFC®, RHU, REBC;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Mar,2015
JFP,Revisiting the Optimal Distribution Glide Path,"Debate continues regarding how an investor's equity allocation should change during retirement. This study tests four different changing equity glide path shapes: increasing, decreasing, V-shaped, and V-shaped contrasted against the potential benefit of a constant glide path. The decreasing glide path was found to be the optimal glide path shape across a wide range of scenarios based on the analysis; however, results showed no clear, one ideal glide path shape for each retiree scenario. The increasing glide path was noted to be the least efficient, and the V and V shapes fell in the middle. The decreasing glide path resulted in approximately 2.0% more utility-adjusted overall potential wealth compared to a constant glide path; the increasing glide path resulted in a 2.7% overall potential wealth decrease. Retiree risk tolerance was not explicitly considered in this analysis. If it was, the decreasing glide path would likely become even more attractive.","Blanchett, David M, CFA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Feb,2015

JFP,Cutting-Edge Estate Planning Strategies for Effective Wealth Transfer,"Ensuring a meaningful legacy for your clients and their loved ones is a challenging task. As a planner, you can now devise wealth transfer strategies to minimize tax implications and protect how your clients pass on financial assets and other property to family members. Lifetime gifts are preferable to testamentary transfers because they allow income and appreciation to grow free of any gift or estate tax for the grantors' heirs. Your clients are presently permitted to annually give up to $14,000 of assets or non-cash property without counting toward their indexed lifetime gift tax exemption of $5.43 million. Consider employing some estate planning techniques to maximize the timely benefits of these fundamental gifting strategies and to enhance the financial security of your clients' future generations. The estate planning techniques are for: 1. minimizing gift tax value, 2.magnifying wealth with a charitable benefit, 3. keeping wealth in the family, 4. gifting with advanced grantor techniques, 5. enhancing legacy planning, and 6. preserving family assets and relationships.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP, CTFA, AEP",0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Feb,2015

The ABLE Act allows an individual, starting in 2015, to establish an ABLE account if they have a disability that started before age 26. ABLE accounts offer tax benefits and the opportunity to stretch the available resource threshold to $100,000, but special needs trusts can be much more beneficial. Third parties, such as parents or grandparents, can create an irrevocable trust for a special needs dependent. In conclusion, ABLE accounts are an option for financial advisers to consider when working with families trying to save for a disabled child's future.

This study uses multivariate analysis of variance and logistic regression analysis statistical techniques to identify the financial characteristics of the firms that lost the most value in the 1987 and 2008 stock market crashes. Results show that beta is a reliable predictor of loss in stock market crashes and that firms with a high financial leverage tend to lose more value in major stock crashes. This study finds that investors who select stocks, stock portfolios, mutual funds, and ETFs with a high beta or stock in firms with a high financial leverage are likely to lose more than average value in a major stock market crash.","Uygur, Ozge, PhD;Meric, Gulser, PhD;Meric, Ilhan, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Feb,2015

And with an average profit margin of about 22%, the typical advisory firm owner with an AUM practice is enjoying record take-home pay. Yet, as advisory firms on the AUM model have grown, their growth rates seem to be slowing. While many have criticized profit margins as being unjustly rich and generous, and therefore prone to disruption, for many advisory firms, the profit margins may not be large enough to withstand the next bear market. At best, most firms will likely find the next bear market to be the most traumatic ever as a firm owner, simply given the sheer operational leverage of today's typical advisory firm.

Support was found for the notion that it behooves financial planners to become aware of their own time perspective and how it may differ from that of their clients.","Albright, Robert, PhD;McDermott, John B, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jan,2015
JFP,5 Keys to an Effective Training and Development Program,"Employees leave for other opportunities when they are no longer learning and developing. Employers may have wanted to provide training and development, but couldn't successfully structure a program. Perhaps, the information in this article will help you properly plan a training and development program to help employees soar. Whether you're a solo practitioner bringing on a new hire, working in human resources at a larger firm, or have limited resources, this article will guide you. Basically, there is a defined minimum amount of knowledge and skills employees should possess before starting a training and development program. The minimum amount of knowledge is based on who the program is for -- new hires or current employees. Meanwhile, five keys to an effective training and development program are presented. The keys are: 1. Consider everybody's work style. 2. Clearly communicate expectations. 3. Motivate from within. 4. Establish consistent progress check-ins. 5. Ask questions.","Dunlap, Mary, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jan,2015

Emerging market issuers have shown they can grow at a faster rate and potentially issue a greater source of income in low-yield environments as developing economies are supported by better demographics, fiscal solvency, and monetary flexibility. Furthermore, emerging market debt is vulnerable to inflationary pressures, but many emerging central banks and governments adhere to stringent policies to monitor inflation. Most investment portfolios largely focus on US assets, but advisers can diversify their fixed-income exposure with emerging debt and access relatively attractive yields.","Lydon, Tom",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jan,2015
JFP,Understanding New IRS Rules for Longevity Insurance,"Longevity insurance is a deferred immediate annuity contract used to hedge against the risk of outliving one's resources. On Jul 1, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) adopted final regulations concerning longevity insurance. The final regulations incorporate several suggestions from practitioners to provide more flexibility to individuals who wish to incorporate longevity insurance into their retirement portfolios. Under the final regulations adopted by the IRS, the value of a qualified longevity annuity contract (QLAC) is excluded from the account balance of a taxpayer when determining required minimum distribution amounts. The final regulations permit QLACs to include return of premium features as well. Consequently, individuals who have concerns about extended life and the possibility of running out of money during retirement can now use longevity insurance, with the IRS's blessing, bringing more certainty to their retirement income projections, and more peace of mind to themselves and their families.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,15-Jan,2015

Creating the Blended Adviser Experience","Much has been written about the surge of the ""robo-adviser"" and the impending doom it signals for the traditional financial adviser business model. Although an active-versus-passive argument isn't the focus of this article, investments have some important undertones in the robo-adviser surge. Aside from the myriad of investment return-based studies, other industry trends have contributed to the rise of online advisory platforms. These facts and trends tell the industry that investment management is ripe to be commoditized. The good news is that many successful advisers are already doing it: offering financial planning and guidance/advice to clients. Perhaps in terms of offering the commoditized services, advisers will need to take a page from the robo-advisers' book, leveraging investment management technologies in order to help scale the process. And although the pure robo-advisers will certainly have a place for some clients, the future for business and technology-savvy financial advisers is brighter than ever.","Tedesco, Darren",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15-Jan,2015

As the book closes on 2014, one might complain that another year has passed with no resolution on a uniform fiduciary standard. Four years after the passage of Dodd-Frank, the SEC appears no closer to a verdict now than in the immediate aftermath of the law's passage. The SEC staff completed its study in January 2011, recommending that the Commission adopt a uniform fiduciary standard, but the Commission has not yet acted. One reason the uniform fiduciary issue is challenging is because the merged title of broker-dealer obscures the difference in the roles and responsibilities of brokers and dealers. Movement toward a uniform fiduciary standard has been indisputable but the biggest challenges lie ahead. The primary goal is no longer seeking agreement that a fiduciary standard is desirable; that has largely occurred, although dissenters still exist.","Laby, Arthur B, JD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Dec,2014

As a result, same-sex couples are an expanding market for estate planners and financial planning professionals. A recent poll conducted by the Insured Retirement Institute found that 86% of lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgendered (LGBT) people surveyed reported that they need wealth management services. However, nearly two-thirds of them have not yet selected a financial planner. To take advantage of this lucrative market, planners need special preparation to succeed. Financial planners are increasingly recognizing that their success with clients depends not just on technical factors, but also on assessment of family dynamics, complexity factors, and communication patterns. In addition to these, there are at least three other areas a planner should discuss with same-sex couples: the couple's legal family status; how the couple has designed their roles as partners and, if relevant, as parents; and the security of their position within their families of origin.","Slater, Suzanne, LICSW",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Dec,2014

Paul and Tracey were thrown for a loop by the non-sequitur of products. In fact, Dave never returned to either of their goals for the remainder of the meeting.

JFP,Policy-Based Financial Planning as Decision Architecture,"When working to help clients achieve positive changes in their lives, financial planners must grapple with the embedded heuristics and cognitive biases held by their clients that have been well documented since Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky published their groundbreaking work, ""A Heuristic for Judging Frequency and Probability,"" in the early 1970s. Since then, psychologists and economists have continued to help deepen the planning profession's understanding of the two cognitive systems that people use for interacting with the world. The automatic system of decision-making evolved because it helped people make rapid decisions in situations where there was high survival value need. Although cognitive biases can lead to poor decision-making, Thaler and Sunstein (2008) have suggested that cognitive biases might be harnessed in ways that ""nudge"" individuals in the direction of better decision-making. Policy-based financial planning provides a methodology for dealing with, and even harnessing, heuristics and cognitive biases.","Yeske, Dave, DBA, CFP;Buie, Elissa, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Dec,2014

It has only been in the past few years that DIA sales have grown sufficiently for anyone outside of the ivory tower to pay much attention. With a recent ruling from the Treasury Department on qualified longevity annuity contracts (QLAC) regarding the ability to defer taxation triggered by RMDs until age 85, you can expect to start hearing much more about DIAs.

For those who have built a successful practice, the question of what to do next looms large. Succession planning can involve anything from selling client assets, to merging with an acquiring firm, to hiring a successor. Many advisers want their legacy to live on and are bringing in new talent long before their own retirement to cultivate young professionals who will be able to manage the business at some point. Developing next generation leaders takes three things: focus, clarity, and consistency. If you seek to have trained and satisfied next gen staff , throwing them into a role and expecting them to figure it out, because that's what the older generation did, is not going to achieve the results you may need.","Flaxington, Beverly D",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Dec,2014

From an investment perspective, trust is a person's reliance on the integrity of a future payout or confidence in the certainty of future payment. Trust, within the domain of financial planning and as defined by Yamauchi and Templer (1982), is a lack of hesitancy, suspicion, or doubt regarding situations involving money. Others have noted that trust is composed of at least two different aspects.

In order for a client to express a particular need, you have to communicate. Before you can garner confidence in what it is you do, you must clearly define yourself. Putting clients' interests first does not become relevant until you are functioning in a way that establishes trust, confidence, and knowledge.

Additionally, a financial planner can provide a financial plan that involves establishing the steps needed to meet a retirement goal and facilitate regular interaction to evaluate progress. A financial planner may also increase a worker's awareness of the consequences of low savings, reduce the psychic costs of making complex choices, and help improve investment performance and tax efficiency within household portfolios. This paper contributes to the literature on the value of financial planners by evaluating the impact of retirement income planning advice on retirement saving. The authors hypothesized that the process of estimating retirement income needs can motivate a household to save more, and that working with a planner can help a client formulate a more realistic estimate of how much they should save and help them maintain a saving plan that results in higher savings rates.","Martin, Terrance K, Jr, PhD;Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Nov,2014

JFP,Benefits and Drawbacks of 401(k) Loans in a Low Interest Rate Environment,"Many 401(k) plans offer participants the option to borrow from their own accounts. Details and restrictions vary across plans, but generally the minimum amount is $1,000 with the maximum amount being the lesser of $50,000 or 50% of the vested account balance. Li and Smith (2008) and Lu and Mitchell (2010) found that liquidity constrained households are more likely to take 401(k) loans. However, Li and Smith (2008) also noted that 401(k) borrowing has been increasing among households that are not liquidity constrained. The main argument against borrowing from a 401(k) is lost investment return. The money borrowed is paid back with a fixed amount of interest rather than a potentially higher return from stock and bond investments. Although the interest rate and the investment return are the most important factors, other variables can dramatically reduce the benefits of 401(k) loans. Origination fees, maintenance fees, size of the loan, and the return on savings are relevant factors that need to be considered.","Johnston, Jarrod, PhD, CFP;Roten, Ivan, PhD, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Nov,2014
JFP,Succession Planning: Are You Proactive or Reactive?,"Firms are faced with the flip side of that hard truth -- at some point, their top financial advisers will be retiring. There are two ways to approach this hard truth: by proactively planning, or by reactively scrambling. Reactively scrambling means pushing off the conversations around how to transfer the value that is represented in a retiring adviser's book of business, holding on to the idea that an adviser will never retire. There is a real opportunity in succession planning if you are willing to get proactive. That means reaching out early and often to start conversations around succession. When planning proactively, the focus isn't only on advisers who are already in the process of retiring. Instead, the focus needs to be on seasoned advisers who are starting to or thinking about ""slowing down.""","Flynn, Daniel J",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Nov,2014
JFP,New Perspectives on the Active versus Passive Debate,"In the mutual funds literature, it has become a virtually stylized fact that, on average, mutual funds with greater operating expenses generate lower net-of-expense returns to their shareholders. Such findings have spurred the trend toward low-cost passive investing. The purpose of this month's column is not to advocate one particular portfolio management strategy over another, but rather to suggest some additional ways to think about which strategy to choose. The main point is that the popularity of active strategies varies over time depending on the ferocity of the competition for acquiring information. Moreover, both the popularity of active strategies and the ferocity of the competition for acquiring information vary across investment categories. In each of the FPA Trends in Investing Surveys from 2006 through 2014, mutual funds ranked as the most popular investment vehicle used by financial advisers.

JFP,The Changing Risk-Return Characteristics of Value and Growth Investing,"Ever since the decision by Morningstar to classify domestic equity mutual funds into one of nine style categories, financial advisers have often been faced with the task of assessing the risk-return characteristics of these equity styles. Investment advisers are perhaps familiar with the historic evidence that portfolios of small companies tend to have higher long-term average returns but also higher volatility than portfolios of large companies. However, the performance of so-called ""value"" stocks versus ""growth"" stocks is less known and more controversial. The purpose of this paper is to explore in depth the risk-return characteristics of value and growth portfolios. In particular, the authors focus on the possibility of average returns and risk changing over time. By examining the historic behavior of these investing styles, it is possible to obtain a better sense of the magnitude and stability of each style's risk and returns. This, in turn, will help investment advisers better match the investment style to their clients.","Emm, Ekaterina E, PhD;Trevino, Ruben C, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Nov,2014

Great service is a necessary but not sufficient condition of an engaged client relationship. There are four components of an effective communication plan -- it is meaningful, profitable, defined, and communicated. To use client feedback effectively to co-create value, consider asking questions about what is important to clients and what they value. Clients may not be able to tell you what is missing, but an effective survey will help you identify the gaps and act as a prelude to a deeper conversation. The final, and perhaps more fundamental, question when it comes to co-creation involves defining the client.

This article reviews how financial planners can recognize and avoid some of the biggest unrecognized errors made in understanding and managing risk, while improving the quality of their risk communications with clients. The common mistakes are: 1. not asking clients what concerns them most, 2. not using an agreed upon empowering definition of risk, 3. not using a proven method for neutralizing risk, 4. lacking awareness of the characteristics of risk, and 5. not helping clients determine which risks to avoid and accept.","Carpenter, Michael T",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Nov,2014

Thankfully, it's not a very hard task. You simply need to ""think different"" when it comes to engaging with clients and prospects. Start paying attention to what your clients appreciate most. Generally speaking, their appreciation preferences will fall into one of the three categories: acknowledgement, time spent, and acts of service. Advisers who simply possess a rock solid investment background or offer a comprehensive financial plan aren't doing enough to compete these days. The key, then, is to be aware of your individual strengths and the strengths of your team members. Even if you are a solo practitioner, you can still identify a wow czar.

JFP,Traditional Versus Roth 401(k) Contributions: The Effect of Employer Matches,"Many employees have the opportunity to contribute to 401(k) plans, but this opportunity has become more complicated in recent years as more employers have expanded their plans' options to include Roth 401(k) accounts in addition to traditional 401(k) accounts. Several papers, including Geisler (2006), and Geisler and Stern (2014), have examined the Roth 401(k) versus traditional 401(k) choice. The typical recommendation from these studies has been to contribute to the Roth retirement account if the tax rate during retirement will be higher than the current tax rate, or contribute to the traditional type retirement account if the tax rate will be lower. An important aspect of 401(k) plans is that employers often match part or all of their employees' contributions. This paper analyzes the Roth 401(k) versus traditional 401(k) contribution decision, taking into account employer matching contributions. This paper presents after-tax accumulation models for the two options, shows the break-even point where they are equivalent, and illustrates the models through numerical examples.","Geisler, Greg, PhD;Hulse, David, PhD",0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Oct,2014

However, financial advisers seeking to include a commodity ETF in their lineup must be aware, as these ETFs are not your typical stock fund.

However, the correlation between commodities and the broader stock market did spike after the financial crisis, but it has since diminished, according to Morningstar data. Commodity ETFs and other funds that invest in futures contracts are susceptible to contango, which occurs when the price on a futures contract is higher than the expected future spot price, creating the upward sloping curve on future commodity prices overtime.","Lydon, Tom",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Oct,2014

In the early 1990s, empirical research into sustainable withdrawals during retirement was understandably nonexistent. As late as 1995, stock-picking guru Peter Lynch claimed that a 7% withdrawal rate from an all-stock portfolio was appropriate. The flaw in this early conventional wisdom was assuming that the average annual return and inflation rate mattered more than the sequence of annual results that comprised them. When you read just the opening page of ""Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data,"" from the October 1994 Journal, you quickly note Bengen's imaginative use of scenario planning, his appreciation for the human dimension of advising clients, his connection of past approaches to their real-world flaws, and his sense that objective and data-driven analysis was needed to shed sufficient light on his subject.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Oct,2014

JFP,How Retirees Spend Their Time: Helping Clients Set Realistic Income Goals,"Financial planners help their clients maximize expected life-time utility, which is defined as a client's happiness or satisfaction. Standard household economic theory (Becker 1965) posits that individuals consume and derive utility from household produced commodities such as meals, a clean house, and a nice garden. These commodities are produced with goods and services but also with time. Production of a household commodity can be ""goods intensive."" That is, it can utilize more goods and services than time, or ""time intensive,"" utilizing more time than goods and services. Because individuals air consuming commodities rather than goods and services directly, financial planners must consider individuals' time use, as well as their purchases of goods and services, upon retirement. In this study, retirees were defined to be individuals aged 50 and older who reported that they were not in the labor force (not employed and not looking for work) or that they were retired.","Kalenkoski, Charlene M, PhD;Oumtrakool, Eakamon",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Oct,2014

Progress is impossible to gauge without a clear picture of where one is at. It's difficult to deny that this idea of a comparative measure concept is most likely rooted in arrogance. It is not just the common practice of comparative measure that is problematic for the adviser/client relationship. Other mistakes in the ""measure mythology"" include: Predicting the future by looking backward and measuring against broad market patterns instead of specific and unique client needs and wants.

JFP,Retirement Planning by Targeting Safe Withdrawal Rates,"Financial advisers frequently find themselves in situations where traditional safe withdrawal rates do not apply. This article provides withdrawal rates for a variety of scenarios from which advisers can select based on the desired probability of success. And a new retirement income planning technique is presented that uses these withdrawal rates, eliminating the need to perform complex Monte Carlo simulations for each client. Three ways to think about safe withdrawal rates: 1. traditional safe withdrawal rates, 2. the target percentage adjustment (TPA), and 3. TPA with 3% maximum. By using lookup tables of safe withdrawal rates, the need to perform complex and cumbersome Monte Carlo simulations is eliminated. This simple technique results in a one-page tabular display that clients can easily understand. Better client understanding results in better client buy in, which in turn results in better client compliance to the retirement plan, more client empowerment, and more overall satisfaction with the financial planning process.","Zolt, David M, CFP®, EA, ASA, MAAA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,6,1,6,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Oct,2014
JFP,Are Your Clients Making the Right Loan Choice?,"Borrowing money is not necessarily a bad thing, but the costs of different loan options vary widely. To avoid financially dangerous situations and maximize wealth, it is important that consumers choose the proper borrowing options to finance their needs. One frequently overlooked loan option for the majority of people with defined contribution pension plans is a plan loan (commonly called a 401(k) loan). In this paper, the authors propose a hypothetical debt scenario to analyze and compare the costs of four loan options used to finance general consumption: 1. 401(k) loans, 2. credit card loans, 3. high-cost loans, and 4. home equity lines of credits (HELOC). The scenario analyses show that 401(k) loans, along with HELOCs, are one of the least expensive loan options under reasonable assumptions. This paper concludes by urging financial planners to take a more proactive role in introducing 401(k) loans to clients as a potentially cheaper loan option.","Tang, Ning, PhD;Lu, Timothy, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Oct,2014

Oechsli said if advisers are in a serious growth mode, they have to delegate. To delegate requires staffing, hiring, training, supervision -- all these other dynamics come into the fold. The Great Recession has changed people's purchasing behaviors. The affluent, in regard to their purchasing decisions, have gone back to basics, back to family values. In the financial services bucket, advisers want investment performance to meet expectations, so it's important for advisers to be very clear on the expectations. The adviser of the future are the ones who have retooled their practice so they're absolutely relevant to their clients today.

It helps if advisers appreciate that diversification is really just a means to an end, not an end in itself. Its goal is to decrease the risk in a portfolio while still allowing a healthy return. Whichever way portfolio risk is measured, the purpose of diversification is to optimize the risk/return trade-off at the portfolio level -- in both normal and stressed markets -- and the means it uses to do so is mixing together poorly correlated asset classes.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFP, CFA, FCAS, CERA;Goodman, Marina, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Sep,2014

The successful relationship is also about understanding the difference between the right financial actions for that specific client versus what might be the right solution for you or another client. It's about having a deep connection to the client and forging one of the most important and trusting relationships that client will have in their life. Finally, it's about effective communications that help clients discover what's right for them without making them feel bad or judged.

Nakamoto guided bitcoin's development until 2010. Unlike most virtual currencies, bitcoin can be exchanged for real-life goods and services on a limited basis. This paper attempts to answer the questions how useful bitcoin is as a currency, and what role bitcoin might play in enhancing the efficiency of an investor's portfolio. In an attempt to examine if bitcoin behaves like a currency, the authors examined the distributional properties of its returns along with those of other major currencies and gold. The analysis reveals that, as a currency, bitcoins are in their infancy. Currently, limited acceptability makes bitcoins a poor medium of exchange, while high volatility makes this asset a poor store of value. Given the observations, and the conclusions from the empirical analysis, individual investors can benefit from holding a small amount of bitcoins in a diversified portfolio.","Wu, Chen Y, PhD;Pandey, Vivek K, DBA, CFA, FRM",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Sep,2014

Of course, these esoteric aspects of planning provide significant value for the client, but often the simplest actions and advice -- such as making sure that beneficiary designations are up to date -- are most important to a client. Beneficiary designations provide an easy way for a client to transfer wealth, but also pose a danger to the unwary. If circumstances change but the client's beneficiary designation does not, property may be transferred to an unintended recipient.

The sustainable withdrawal rate can fall well below that implied by the average portfolio return over the retirement period, because a market decline early in the retirement period digs a hole that is difficult to overcome. Historically in the US, one could withdraw 4% of his or her retirement date portfolio, adjust this amount for inflation in subsequent years, and sustain withdrawals over 30 years using a diversified portfolio with 50% to 75% stocks. By adding greater realism to the underlying assumptions, one can identify a number of factors suggesting numbers both higher than and lower than 4%.

The value lies in the best economic rewards, in lives best lived, and in the thrill and meaning experienced and exchanged in the engagement. You might think it is security that delivers financial planning's value, and it certainly has its place, but security (the financial architecture) is best applied last.

Much of the literature suggests that a total return objective is a better choice than focusing on portfolio yield for retirees. This analysis furthers this literature by revisiting the cash flow and estate objectives of a retiree. Results suggest that: 1. using a yield portfolio forces a tradeoff between retirement spending and estate goals; 2. current yields may not be high enough to meet retirement income needs; 3. yields change over time, leading to inconsistent spending; 4. drawing down an efficient portfolio with the same risk as a portfolio emphasizing yield has higher expected principal accumulation; and 5. drawing down a portfolio is more tax-efficient than using yield to generate retirement income.","Pittman, Sam, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Aug,2014

With $1.8 trillion in assets under management, ETFs currently have about 11% of all assets invested in the mutual fund space. That number grows by about 1% to 2% a year. ETFs are winning market share because they are inherently cheaper and more tax-efficient than traditional mutual funds. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs almost never pay capital gains distributions, shielding clients from unwanted taxes. For large advisers, fairly parsing out ETF trades that clear on different platforms can be an enormous headache.

Based on the analysis, the optimal form of guaranteed income varies materially depending on model assumptions and retiree preferences. Nominal SPIAs, especially those with a 20-year certain payment period, tend to be the most efficient among the eight annuity types considered in this analysis, on average, followed by nominal SPIAs and nominal DIAs. However, if DIA payout rates increase by only 5%, nominal DIAs become the most attractive option, on average.

A beneficiary who does not act carefully may miss a window of opportunity to have various parts of Medicare coverage and face a waiting period to get coverage, incurring high out-of-pocket costs in the interim as well as paying lifelong penalties. By understanding Medicare enrollment periods, advisers can help their clients avoid these problems. After the Initial Enrollment Period ends, a beneficiary may have the chance to sign up for Medicare Parts A and B during a Special Enrollment Period (SEP).

While 60% of funds beat the Barclays Capital Index, less than 48% beat the Merrill Lynch Index.

As is evident from the analysis, the portfolios generated carry significant unsystematic risk, indicating that diversification could be improved and that holding such a portfolio subjects one to unnecessary risks that are not necessarily rewarded as part of the risk premium. Results from the multivariate analyses suggest that after controlling for a number of risk factors, a simple market-indexed, diversified portfolio remained a better option for unsophisticated investors during the Great Recession. Some individuals working with financial planners may choose to pursue hot stocks with a portion of their portfolio.

Prosch said he set out to write a book that changes the transaction and puts the onus on the parent to begin conversation and overcome emotional barriers. Financial planning is not just about managing your assets, although that's certainly important. It's also about managing your expenses, and he doesn't mean just your day-to-day expenses. In the book, he talks about four key dimensions of the later years in life, and he thinks all four of them impact your finances. The Other Talk covers much on financial planning. It covers where to live, how to manage financial needs, and legacy plans for family when the client dies. Clients should establish spending priorities and explore various payment options, including reverse mortgages, lines of credit, and Medicaid waiver programs.","Rattiner, Jeffrey H, CFP, CPA, RFC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jul,2014
JFP,Obtain a More Accurate Assessment of Your Clients' Risk Profile,"Financial professionals often employ risk profile instruments to quantify an investor's ability to tolerate risk. While these profilers are standard in the industry, their validity as risk assessors has been put into question by researchers and financial planning practitioners. Combining a risk profile analysis with a qualitative perception of risk will provide additional information and a more complete risk profile of the investor. The purpose of understanding loss aversion is to better understand how investors may respond to different financial outcomes. To obtain a better understanding of the investor's qualitative risk profile, it is suggested that advisers attempt to identify if their clients are loss averse, and to what degree. Financial practitioners who take time to understand their clients' complete risk profile (quantitative and qualitative) will be in a better position to recommend investment strategies that are more suitable for who their clients are today, with the goal of improving investor performance and investor experience.","Mooreland, Jay, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jul,2014

As the ETF universe continues to expand, the variety of dividend-related investment options have increased. Compared to high-flying growth stocks or small-capitalization companies, dividend-paying companies seem like a boring trade. However, these companies tend to be more mature, providing an investment portfolio with a sense of predictability and stability. Combined with a consistent dividend payout, more established companies can produce stable and solid returns over the long haul. While browsing through the dividend ETFs available on the market, look beyond the yield generated and consider how the fund achieves its goals.","Lydon, Tom",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jul,2014

When an objective observer looks at the services provided by a good financial planner and compares that to the offering of a robo-adviser or other low-cost provider, there are substantial differences. The consumer is not getting the same thing at a lower price. They're getting a small portion of the services a good financial planner provides for that lower price. The complexity of personal financial issues and the volume and velocity of information thrown at the public is only intensifying.

JFP,Life Insurance Policy Replacements: Dos and Don'ts,"Policy replacement refers to terminating an existing policy in favor of a new one. It is absolutely mandatory the existing policy remains in place until the new one is in force. If a taxable gain is associated with the existing policy, it should be transferred using Section 1035, which allows for a tax-free exchange. For life insurance agents, policy replacement is the easiest sale. The policyowner doesn't need to decide if they want more life insurance. The agent makes the claim that the new policy will be a better deal, but this isn't always the case. There are three considerations when advising a client about a possible replacement of an existing policy. One is to determine the current health status of the insured and compare it with the underwriting on the existing policy. Another issue is assessing the pricing quality of the existing policy. Even if the existing policy's pricing is excellent, the final replacement element can trump pricing.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jul,2014

JFP,Financing a Business Startup or Acquisition Using Rollover Funds,"Financial planners are likely to have clients who are interested in owning their own businesses. Retirement accounts are often the clients only available source of significant funds to finance the startup or purchase. The taxes and penalties resulting from accessing funds in a retirement account can significantly reduce the money available]e for funding. A solution may be Rollovers as Business Startups (ROBS) plans. For clients who can follow the rules in establishing a ROBS and comply with the future reporting requirements and regulations, a ROBS provides an attractive alternative path to financing a new business. An IRS ROBS memorandum, designed to guide PS staff through auditing a ROBS, can serve as a road map for advisers and clients. This paper examines issues raised by the IRS memorandum, explains the steps to setting up a ROBS, and reviews the IRS and DOL operations and compliance aspects governing ROBS.","Hopson, Patricia D, CPA;Hopson, James F, JD, CPA",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jun,2014

Carson has been involved in a couple of succession plans with advisers, and they've always thought they had one, but when you looked to see if it was executable, a lot of times they weren't funded, they weren't documented properly, the valuation was outdated -- it was either way too low or way too high -- and there wasn't anyway for it to really happen. Meanwhile, many advisers are not spending enough on technology, so over the next 12 months one of his favorite sayings is that technology spend will promote you or will expose you. Regarding fee transparency, the industry hasn't done a good job of disclosing where the fees are, where the conflicts are.

As planner and fellow Journal columnist Ross Levin once wrote, the more confidence they have in their forecasts, the more likely they are to be wrong about them. Clearly, there are always more than enough prognosticators ready to share the rationales behind their predictions. At least one widely used provider of financial planning software uses its own assumptions about the future -- returns, inflation, volatility, etc -- as capital market inputs, thereby shifting its results from being historically based. Policies are not new to financial planning. Policy-based approaches to investment management have existed for several decades. In distribution planning, the two areas most powerfully affected when governed by dynamic policies are the portfolios equity allocation and the annual withdrawal amount.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jun,2014

The standard deviation for average monthly risk tolerance scores was relatively low (186%) compared to monthly S&amp;P 500 values (1,727%). Average monthly risk tolerance scores increased as price/earnings ratios increased and decreased as dividend yields increased.

JFP,Why Investors Need to Understand the Shape of the Compound Growth Curve,"Ask the majority of financial advisers what is the most valuable ally for new investors seeking to maximize growth, and the power of compounding would be it. In fact, the story goes that Albert Einstein labeled compounding as the most powerful force in the universe. Unlike so many other uncertain aspects of our financial lives, compound growth, once put to work, can become a mathematical certainty. Money invested then re-invested over time Will grow and grow at exponential rates. This article attempts to explain why many beginning investors seemingly walk away from adopting a compounding style of investing and therefore lose a valuable opportunity to grow their money. The fact is that compounding of wealth over time follows a very specific mathematical curvature. The shape of this curve provides insight as to why new and specifically young investors often give up on diligently reinvesting and ultimately lose out on compounding's effects.","Parsons, Jeff C, CFP©",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-May,2014
JFP,Measure and Manage Risk Tolerance More Effectively,"According to Warren Buffett, investing is simple, but it is not easy. This eloquent sentence captures the complexities financial advisers and clients face in identifying and implementing an appropriate investment strategy. These complexities often take predictable forms known as biases. Many of these biases relate to how individual investors perceive risk and act in the face of risk. This article shows how behavioral finance issues and investor psychology could lead to poor decision-making. It inspects the flaws contained in typical risk tolerance questionnaires. It then examines ways to improve on these questionnaires by proposing a framework that allows for asking and answering client-specific questions. In the process, this will enhance the adviser-client relationship while improving the client investing experience.","Jacobsen, Brian J, PhD, CFP®, CFA;Speidel, Peter, CFA;Keshemberg, Travis L, CFA, CIPM, CIMA;Hodapp, Ryan, CFA, CAIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-May,2014

JFP,Mutual Fund Redemption Fees Can Benefit Long-Term Investors,"Mutual funds often buy and sell securities for their portfolios to meet the purchase and redemption requests of their shareholders. The ultimate impact of these liquidity-motivated transactions within a mutual fund's portfolio on returns is difficult to gauge. This is because the prices at which securities in the fund's portfolio are transacted at cannot be directly observed by clients. However, the impact of these trading costs is economically meaningful. The purpose of this column is to summarize the practical implications of recent research on investing in funds with short-term redemption fees as a means of controlling exposure to these costs and ultimately improving returns. In summary, the short-term traders in a mutual fund drag down the returns to the long-term investors because the fund must engage in costly liquidations of securities in order to fulfill redemption requests. Alternatively, the fund may hold a large reserve of low-yielding cash to avoid selling securities at ""fire sale"" prices.","Nanigian, David, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-May,2014

JFP,Exploring the Retirement Consumption Puzzle,"Retirement income research and financial planning tools generally assume that retiree expenditures, or consumption, increase annually by inflation during retirement. This assumption is counter to a growing body of empirical research that has noted actual retiree expenditures tend to decrease both upon, and during, retirement. This phenomenon has been named the ""retirement consumption puzzle."" For this paper, government data on consumption was analyzed to understand how retiree consumption actually changes over time. The results of the analysis suggests that although the retiree consumption basket is likely to increase at a rate that is faster than general inflation -- a fact that can largely be attributed to the higher weight to medical expenses for retirees -- actual retiree spending tends to decline in retirement in real terms. This decrease in real consumption averages approximately 1% per year during retirement. Changes in real consumption tend to be greater in both early and late retirement.","Blanchett, David, CFP®, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-May,2014

However, research such as Boston College's National Retirement Risk Index 2010, has noted that many future retirees will not be in a position to avoid using home equity in retirement. This study outlines recent changes in the reverse mortgage market and attempts to shed light on two simple questions: Which client-specific and capital market factors should a practitioner emphasize and based on these critical factors, how does early or delayed establishment influence whether a reverse mortgage can improve the probability of clients' maintaining their retirement spending goals? The motivation for this investigation stems from concerns associated with delayed establishment of reverse mortgages noted by Kitces (2011).

Training like a pro begins with having a winner's mentality -- going into each game knowing that you are there to win. Prospecting is no different. Training your mind using that winner's mentality that ""every no brings me closer to a yes"" is a must. However, this alone wont ensure success -- you must also sharpen your prospecting skills.

It is a necessary evil between at-bats. The investments part of financial planning is like taking two steps forward, and the insurance part is like trying to avoid taking one step back. It's useful, but doesn't capture the imagination. It costs a lot of money and offers nothing tangible in return. It's hard to like insurance.

A clear distinction exists between advancing your knowledge with specialties and using designations that have been created chiefly as ""marketing"" designations. Even the less-stringent designations can help advisers to better assist their clients, if only in specific capacities. The financial planning profession continues to evolve. This is especially true given the demand for an increase in financial service regulation. To date, it is still unclear what changes they can expect.

In trust and estate law, the almost universal ""slayer rule"" prohibits inheritance by a person who murders someone from whom he or she will inherit. If the decedent marries the caregiver, elder abuse and undue influence arguments still apply. Harmed beneficiaries who want to bring legal action to reclaim their inheritances may face no-contest or mandatory arbitration clauses in the decedent's will or trust.

JFP,Lifetime Expected Income Breakeven Comparison between SPIAs and Managed Portfolios,"Retirees have a choice between fully managing their retirement assets, partially annuitizing, and fully annuitizing. Single premium immediate annuities (SPIA) provide protection against market downturns and above-average longevity; however, these products may not provide inflation protection, and their use often removes the potential for an end-of-life bequest. Managed portfolios provide less certainty about returns but more opportunity for growth and legacy planning. Clients and their advisers often ask how they should choose between the two options. This paper seeks to address this issue by determining breakeven asset allocations below which SPIAs provide higher lifetime expected total cash flows. The analysis described shows how a client's age is related to the decision. The analysis also shows that other factors impact the choice, including cash flow needs, market returns, and fees. A Monte Carlo model was developed to track cash flow and portfolio balances by age and allocation.

The two schools are probability-based and safety-first. The probability-based school of thought's key perspectives on managing risks for a successful retirement include portfolio diversification as it relates to modern portfolio theory, and precautionary savings as connected to the idea of saving enough to meet goals with a conservative withdrawal strategy over a long planning horizon.

The typical middle market household has also been the fastest-growing segment in the market for financial advice (Longo 2003). The size of the middle market is large and includes many baby boomers who axe at or near retirement. However, because the average amount of investable assets of middle market clients is moderate, these clients are often overlooked and underserved. This study had three specific objectives. The first was to identify the characteristics of financial planners who work with the middle market. The second was to examine the barriers that planners face when serving middle market clients. Specifically, the study explored the specific issues related to compensation structure, information asymmetry, and planning for clients within this category. The third objective was to describe the various financial planning processes that have been implemented by planners to effectively serve the needs of these clients.","Harness, Nathaniel, PhD, CFP;Chatterjee, Swarn, PhD, CRC;Salter, John, PhD, CFP, AIFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,6,1,6,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,14-Apr,2014

Life insurance is unique in the sense that it covers a loss that is certain to eventually occur. As long as the policy is maintained, the stream of premium payments will ultimately result in the policyholder's receipt of the death benefit -- and this allows for a rate-of-return calculation that is inapplicable to other types of insurance coverage.","Smith, Jordan H, JD, LLM",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,14-Mar,2014

Nearly 80 million baby boomers are expected to retire over the next 18 years. Unfortunately, the recent recession has eroded their retirement portfolio values, increasing retirees' dependence on Social Security. The long-term solvency of the Social Security system, however, is uncertain. Thus, having alternative sources of retirement incomes important. Reverse mortgages are one possible alternative. The recent housing market crash has negatively impacted the reverse mortgage market by reducing home values; however, current expansionary monetary policies may create new opportunities.

JFP,Recent Changes in the Gains from Delaying Social Security,"Social Security retirement benefits can be claimed at any age between 62 and 70, with delayed claiming resulting in larger monthly payments. Claiming Social Security benefits later generally increases the present value of lifetime benefits for most individuals. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, a number of policy changes increased the gains from delay, particularly for couples. In addition, mortality improved and real interest rates fell considerably over this period, further increasing the attractiveness of delay. For the purposes of this study, simulations to examine the role of these factors in changing the gains from delay were performed. Findings suggest that the gains from delay increased substantially after 2000, with changes in the interest rate playing the largest role in driving the increase.","Shoven, John B, PhD;Slavov, Sita Nataraj, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Mar,2014

Succession and exit planning is not just about mature advisers. Younger planners, especially those seeking a path to ownership in a practice, have a vested interest. The focus should be practice growth and continuity. A well-defined track to managing transition involves more than owners and successors.

Unsurprisingly, women who don't invest in their education and careers fare far worse than those who do. The authors consider if, as a profession, financial advisors are giving married women the best advice on investing in their personal human capital. A married woman's human capital is a source of wealth that often has been overlooked, or the short-term costs given outsized emphasis.

An alternative built on the lifecycle-based minimum savings rate necessary to maintain real income or real expenditure levels through retirement appears to provide a better solution. Savings plans designed to maintain real income levels during retirement increase real living expenditure levels over those experienced during working years because part of the working income was invested, not consumed.

The common law of agency imposes fiduciary duties of loyalty, care, and a host of subsidiary rules that reinforce and give meaning to loyalty and care as applied to specific circumstances. This paper considers how the fiduciary duties of state agency law might be applied to a financial adviser with discretionary trading authority over a client's account.

Account transfer errors, an adviser's failure to implement a planned tax or insurance action, or investment trading errors that result in a client suffering financial loss are some examples. The questions advisers must address in the aftermath of a mistake are central to the advising relationship. There are ways to be proactive, ethical, empathic, and responsive in the aftermath of a mistake, to deliver what they consider ""a proper apology."" The solution is for the adviser to keep his or her emotions in check, engage in active listening, and employ good interviewing techniques using open ended questions and clarifying questions.

Each of these contributed to financial planning's evolution. And, true to Newton's third law of motion, for every action there did seem to be a rather equal and opposite reaction.

The three mistakes people make most frequently are the bread-and-butter fundamentals. The first is failure to take a required minimum distribution. The second is failure to name a beneficiary for their IRA or other retirement plan, and the third is rollover mistakes. And this is where having a financial planner is going to make all the difference to make sure these things get done right. The big possibility is if you have employer stock in your retirement plan, you potentially get a special deal that the rest of you don't get, and that is a lump sum distribution of your retirement plan. The new landscape for federal estate tax planning divides the world of married couples into three groups: the poor, the rich, and the middle.","Schulaka, Carly",1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Feb,2014

JFP,Expense Ratios Don't Matter (That Much) in ETFs,"According to a study by Charles Schwab, expense ratios are the No. 1 factor investors consider when deciding which ETFs to buy. The study is self-serving; nonetheless, the author thinks it's true. Expense ratios do matter, but in the grand scheme of things -- particularly as you look at non-standard ETFs -- they matter a lot less than you think. The problem with expense ratios is that they only tell part of the story. Actively managed ETFs aside, the goal of most ETFs is to track an index. Expense ratios are still important. But at least in sticky areas like emerging markets -- particularly with more sophisticated strategies -- tracking difference is a much more important statistic.","Hougan, Matt",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Feb,2014
JFP,Suitability Versus Fiduciary Standard,"As the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to examine the possible implementation of a uniform fiduciary standard, investment professionals who operate under suitability guidelines may be wondering how changing to a fiduciary model may impact their business and their client relationships. In an attempt to answer that question -- as well as questions about differences in the advice and products registered representatives and investment advisers offer -- the authors surveyed a national sample of nearly 400 investment professionals. The results of that survey shed new light on the potential benefits to consumers of a uniform fiduciary standard and highlight the perceived impacts of changing one's standard of care. Fiduciary responsibility has been defined as the minimum obligation that professionals should have toward their clients; it's believed to be part of the contract of engagement between two parties. Most investment advisers reported meeting with new clients an average of two or more times before recommending an investment, compared with 35% of registered representatives.","Goetz, Joseph W, PhD, AFC, CRC®;Chatterjee, Swarn, PhD, CRC®;Cude, Brenda J, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,14-Feb,2014

This paper summarizes what the academic literature has to say about investing in US small-cap stocks and also reviews the available index data on the issue of small- versus large-cap performance. Small-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks on an absolute basis in the US over the period 1926-2012. There is evidence that the absolute outperformance has been weaker in the period since 1981. Findings show that the size effect has been concentrated in the month of January and that small-cap stocks are riskier than large-cap stocks. There is economic logic to suggest the small-cap outperformance evidences a risk premium. Small value has outperformed small growth stocks on an absolute basis. This paper demonstrates that overweighting small-cap and small-cap value stocks can improve the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio.","McDermott, John B, PhD;D'Auria, Dana, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jan,2014
JFP,Reducing Retirement Risk with a Rising Equity Glide Path,"This study explores the issue of what is an appropriate default equity glide path for client portfolios during the retirement phase of the lifecycle. Results show, surprisingly, that rising equity glide paths in retirement -- where the portfolio starts out conservative and becomes more aggressive through the retirement time horizon -- have the potential to actually reduce both the probability of failure and the magnitude of failure for client portfolios. Overall, the results show that rising equity glide paths from conservative starting points can achieve superior results, even with tower average lifetime equity exposure. For instance, a portfolio that starts at 30% in equities and finishes at 60% performs better than a portfolio that starts and finishes at 60% equities. A steady or rising glide path provides superior results compared to starting at 60% equities and declining to 30% over time.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA;Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jan,2014

JFP,Protect Your Global Equity from Devaluating Currencies,"International equity exposure helps diversify portfolios away from home country bias, but many advisers are finding currency fluctuations adversely affect returns. Currency-hedged ETFs are a solution to that problem. Advisers must take into account the targeted foreign market conditions and potential changes in the foreign exchange market. Generally, a foreign investment will benefit from an appreciating local currency, however, a weaker local currency means the foreign investment is worth fewer US dollars. With ETFs, financial advisers who are interested in diversifying into overseas equities can take control of foreign currency risk. Investors don't have to worry about the negativity associated with a weak currency. Instead, a currency-hedged equity ETF takes the Forex out of the equation and allows advisers to focus on foreign market returns.","Lydon, Tom",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jan,2014

Some of the most ardent supporters of the profession have expressed extreme frustration, even hopelessness. The author's message today is simply don't let these things keep you from doing what you can to advance the profession. You have an ace in the hole. And you will need it. The US House of Representatives passed HR 2374, the laughably named ""Retail Investor Protection Act,"" which simultaneously called for the Department of Labor to wait for the SEC to come out with a fiduciary rule first, while also imposing new requirements on the SEC making it very difficult for the SEC to come out with a rule at all. The ace is the community of financial planning professionals.

Longevity insurance typically is structured as a single premium deferred annuity with a specified future start date for payments. In February 2012, the IRS proposed regulations that would permit taxpayers to purchase longevity insurance inside of retirement accounts. To qualify for the special benefits allowed under the proposed regulations, a qualified longevity annuity contract -- an annuity contract that meets distribution requirements, premium limitations, and design limitations -- must be purchased. Prior to the publication of these proposed regulations, longevity insurance already was growing in popularity in the planning community.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,14-Jan,2014

Above-average tax rates and greater returns increase the possible value of using HIFO accounting. Similarly, portfolios that are not completely liquidated, such as those that receive a stepped up basis in an estate, may also have greater HIFO benefits but not likely greater than 2% of the value of the portfolio.","Atra, Robert J, PhD, CFA;Pae, Yuntaek, PhD, CFA",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14-Jan,2014

Although you are not a marital counselor, nor should you be playing that role, coaching couples on engaging in effective money conversations is within your purview. Curiosity is a great tool for tolerating clients' difficult feelings and mitigating financial conflicts. It helps you to be in the moment with your clients when the discussion taps into strong emotions, either for you or the clients. Although similar to curiosity, open-mindedness is more about a state of mind than being inquisitive. To be open-minded involves being receptive to ideas and practicing the Zen principle of beginner's mind. When couples engage in effective conflict, they must allow themselves to be vulnerable with each other and you. Therefore, it is vital that as the facilitator, you take a nurturing stance.

This review may lead to the creation of an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) and the transfer of some or all of the client's existing life insurance to the ILIT. Two potential problem areas need to be considered before implementing the decision to create and fund an ILIT. The transfer of an existing life insurance policy to an ILIT is a taxable gift. Unfortunately, in the last 20 or so years, it has become increasingly difficult to determine the amount of the taxable gift. Once the policy is owned by the ILIT, the insured provides the funds for the payment of premiums by making annual gifts to the insurance trust. In the past, a great deal of attention was devoted to making those gifts qualify for the gift tax annual exclusion.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Dec,2013

The SWR is defined as the maximum real withdrawal rate with a minimum 90% plan survival rate for a 30-year retirement horizon. Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the success of the SRM strategy at various real withdrawal rates for a client who has a $500,000 investment nest egg and $250,000/$500,000 in home equity at the beginning of retirement. The $500,000 nest egg is split into a 60% stocks and 40% bonds IP and a six-month cash reserve. Results pertaining to the low interest rate and current lending environment indicate that a 5.0% SWR is attainable for the SRM strategy when home equity is at least 50% of the IP at retirement. The SWR for the SRM strategy is estimated to be as high as 6.75% for retirees in the low interest rate environment where home equity is equal to the IP at the beginning of retirement.","Pfeiffer, Shaun, PhD;Salter, John, PhD, CFP, AIFA;Evensky, Harold, CFP, AIF",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,13-Dec,2013
JFP,Measuring the Risk of Running Out of Money in Retirement,"This paper presents two important innovations that will help financial planners improve the spending and asset allocation decisions of their clients in retirement. The current prevalent approach of using a deterministic planning horizon (assuming a single death age) to assess sustainability risk often misrepresents the actual risk of running out of money in retirement. This paper proposes a simple way to measure sustainability risk -- mortality-adjusting -- that accounts for the joint occurrence of being alive and running out of money. Different assumptions regarding the age of death of a client leads to very different assessments of retirement sustainability risk. Results show the discrepancy in assessed sustainability risk computed using these different deterministic planning horizons, relative to the mortality-adjusting approach, to be quite large. Findings can help planners more accurately represent sustainability risk, thereby increasing the value they deliver to their retired clients.","Gardner, Grant, PhD;Pittman, Sam, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Dec,2013

All that's needed are investors -- and therein lies the problem; there are few to be found. The prospect of a uniform fiduciary standard for all advisers, including brokers, makes a core index-fund strategy even more appealing. Like traditional actively managed funds, the success or failure of an actively managed ETF will rely on one factor: performance.

The first is the pre-retirement phase when thoughts and feelings about retirement begin entering the person's mind. Next comes the retirement phase itself. The third phase is the post-retirement phase, when the person has formed a new life under different social and psychological conditions.

JFP,The 6.0 Percent Rule,"The 4% rule has come under scrutiny because of lower expectations about future security returns. Monte Carlo simulations using expected asset class risks and returns that reflect the current economy show that the first-year withdrawal can be 3.75% and increased for inflation each year, At 3.75%, portfolios with a 60% or higher equity exposure give a 90% chance of spending success over 30 years. The cash proceeds from various reverse mortgage plans can be taken in different ways. Scheduled monthly tax-free advances reduce the need for portfolio withdrawals and can give better spending success levels than line-of-credit draws. The increase in spending success levels depends on the relative value of the home and the portfolio. Given a portfolio value, higher home values raise success rates. With a 30-year spending horizon and first-year withdrawal of 6.0%, reverse mortgage scheduled advances as a portfolio supplement give spending success levels of 88% to 92%. Even with a first-year withdrawal of 6.5%, success levels are still 83% to 86%. This paper provides financial planners with a review of the relative merits of using a reverse mortgage as a retirement spending supplement.","Wagner, Gerald C, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Dec,2013

JFP,Defining a Fee-Only Fiduciary Profession,"The author has been thinking a lot about three terms that have been bandied about their business forever -- fee- only, fiduciary, and profession. For him, this simply means that his clients directly pay him and he places their interests ahead of his own. It doesn't speak at all to the quality of his work, but it does mean that he won't act upon his conflicts of interest if they are not in the client's best interest. Where things get twisted in this argument is when planners use these as phrases that make them holier than thou. As a fee-only planner, the author still has conflicts of interest. He simply has fewer than when he also received commissions in the 1980s. He believes becoming fee-only helped build his career, not cost him it.

JFP,Understanding Retirement Date Risk: Why saving a little for a long time may be riskier than you think,"The mathematical benefits of saving early in life are pretty straightforward -- to have $1 million at retirement. However, as the account balance rises -- due to the accumulation of ongoing contributions and the annual compounding of growth itself -- each additional contribution actually has less and less of an impact on the annual increases of the balance over time. The problem with a strategy that becomes increasingly reliant on returns over time is that it leaves the prospective retiree highly prone to disappointment if market returns do not add up as anticipated in the final years. Viewed another way, a shorter path may require greater savings, but it also has less risk about whether the target retirement date will be achieved. This perspective arguably presents an alternative and better way of viewing the risk of unfavorable market returns, where clients consider the scenarios based not on the volatility of the wealth outcome, but also on the uncertainty of the retirement date.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Dec,2013

The paper seeks to quantify the effect of investments in human capital on the income of divorced women using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79.

Two groups of studies have examined this issue. The first uses the traditional approach to calculate an investor's asset allocation and generally has concluded that the optimal asset location decision depends upon specific assumptions about returns and tax rates. The second group uses the after-tax approach to calculate an investor's asset allocation and generally has concluded that the optimal asset location decision is to locate stocks in taxable accounts and bonds in retirement accounts to the extent possible while attaining the target asset allocation. This paper concludes by indicating that except in rare cases, investors should hold stocks in taxable accounts and bonds in retirement accounts.","Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA;Meyer, William",0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Nov,2013

JFP,Lessons from Postage Meters,"Pitney Bowes started out as the only game in town. It not only had a differentiated business model, it was the only one approved to do what it did. But over time, the company faced increasing competition from other companies that could do the same thing. Price competition ensued to the point that the dispensing of postage became a commodity. The same could easily happen to the financial planning profession if they follow the Pitney Bowes model. Absent a monopoly, they've tended to use differentiation as their method of attracting clients. In the mid-1980s, financial planning firms began registering as RIAs, and ""fiduciary"" was their differentiator. The academic work of several Nobel laureates in the fields of finance, economics, and psychology formed the structure and processes of many firms, adding another layer of differentiation. A profession cannot long exist without a systematic body of theory that is developed, tested, and proven.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Nov,2013

As financial planners, they tend to view the word pretty simply. They have expertise. They analyze a client's situation and they give great recommendations. Everything they think about from the advisory point of view is focused on the client. But you need to put the clients' lenses on and look at yourself from their perspective. Many of the ways financial planners communicate, the gestures that they use, or how they interact interpersonally, that's nonverbal communication, and it works well if you're culturally attuned to that. The financial planning field is split into two camps. One camp says risk tolerance is absolutely an essential building block of all financial plans.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Nov,2013

There was is a very limited market for LTC. 2. There was no real experience with pricing LTC, so companies would price it to sell and premiums would soar. 3. Stick with the most ethical companies. Rather soon after LTC policies were sold, many companies began raising premiums on existing policies. Many insurance sales begin with a client being solicited by an agent who highlights the fears and/or greed of a client that some insurance product will solve.

This study shows that clients who annuitize half of their spending needs now and delay annuitization of remaining spending needs for 20 years can obtain an efficient frontier that is nearly identical to that of annuitizing 100% of spending needs now. This paper adds to the literature by showing that clients who are unwilling to give up liquidity or invest 100% in equities should consider the timing of annuity products.

There are two versions of this hypothesis. The narrower form of the hypothesis states that when the US stock market in January is positive, the rest of the year will be positive.

A financial planning firm has two owners and five employees. The five employees are an associate planner, a paraplanner, a portfolio/investment specialist, a client service specialist/executive assistant, and an administrative assistant. A complaint was filed with the state department of labor regarding employees working more than 40 hours per week and not getting paid overtime. Employees felt they were owned overtime, and this was substantiated through the audit. Improper or insufficient documentation did not support the employer's treatment of employee's pay. If a planning firm is audited, job descriptions will be reviewed to determine overtime eligibility. Legal and human resource experts will guide employers on how to communicate issues regarding misclassification and potential back pay.","Dunlap, Mary, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Nov,2013

Traditional sales training tends to view objections as a failure to properly explain the value or advantages of the product, service, or recommendation. If the client just had more information, or the right information, presented in the right way, then the objection would be overcome. The novice sales person who ""failed"" would put more effort into educating him or herself on the details and benefits of the product in preparation for the next sales opportunity. This article explores the change process, ambivalence toward change, resistance toward change, and introduces evidenced-based techniques to help financial planners shepherd clients through the change process.

Some of the most admired change-makers in history clearly endured and overcame incredibly stressful events. In many cases, the energy scores of advisers are under the mean because they are not committed to non-work activities. They don't allow themselves to retreat from work, even if it's just an hour to be home at the dinner table. All too often, the iPhone remains inseparable from the adviser, tethering him or her to work's unremitting demands. If you want to be an elite adviser, you must create optimal rhythm.

Depending on the unique circumstances of each investor impacted by this, incorrect filing could cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars per year. The potential impact varies depending on the state of residency: some states do not tax municipal bond interest at all, some tax interest only for out-of-state municipal bonds, and others tax all municipal bonds regardless of locality. In today's uncertain rate environment, it is more important than ever to help clients keep more of what they earn. Investors who own municipal bonds that are subject to taxation should refer to IRS Publication 550 to determine the proper way to account for income and amortization over time.","Collins, William R, IV, CFP®, CRPC®",1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Oct,2013
JFP,Advisers at the Success Crossroads: Grow or Disengage?,"As Anthony Robbins and others have said, ""If you're not growing, you're dying."" Look around the industry and you'll see a variety of attitudes toward business growth among financial advisers. Some successful advisers maintain a relentless focus on topline revenue growth, expanding their client base, going upstream to higher net worth clients, providing additional services, acquiring other practices, or recruiting new advisers to increase capacity and scale.

While working in Japan, they had PhD students who were government officials from a lot of different countries, so he started looking at the national pension systems in countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, and so on. All countries are experiencing rapidly aging populations that will strain their pension systems, and pension reform is an important topic around the world, so that's the other big area where he's worked on research. On what led him into the world of financial planning, it was his experience at the Journal of Financial Planning that made a big impact on that, moving him in that direction.

JFP,Managing Life Insurance Policies: An Analytical Approach Built on Standard Actuarial Techniques,"This paper is intended to address a need in the financial community: the lack of adequate analytical information to enable life insurance policy owners and their advisers to make informed policy management decisions. This paper presents three hypothetical questions that life insurance policy owners often face, but are ill-equipped to answer; it then shows how analytical techniques can be applied in answering them. This paper illustrates how the familiar concept of internal rate of return also can be used to guide life insurance policy decisions. The paper includes actuarial formulas used to calculate the numbers presented in the hypothetical cases.","Hezzelwood, William L",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Oct,2013
JFP,Battle Rising Rates with ETFs,"As Treasury yields move off their historic lows, financial advisers are dusting off old fixed-income hedging strategies for a rising rate environment. With the expansion of ETFs, advisers now have more options at their fingertips. In a rising rate environment, investors need to monitor their duration and bond interest rate risk. Duration is the measure of a security's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, and the number provides a good sense of how much a bond's price will decline as interest rates rise. Bonds with larger durations have a greater interest rate risk. Convertibles provide exposure to the equity market and do well against other fixed-income options when rates rise.","Lydon, Tom",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Oct,2013
JFP,Avoiding Post-ATRA Trust Tax Rates,"The 39.6% ordinary tax rate and 20% capital gain tax rate enacted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), and the 3.8% Medicare investment surtax now apply when trust income exceeds $11,950. These high rates apply at much lower levels of income for trusts than for individual taxpayers. With this disparity in mind, grantors creating trusts and trustees managing trusts should consider some strategies. There are two broad types of trusts: grantor mists and nongrantor trusts. Grantor trusts are ignored for tax purposes, and an individual grantor pays tax on the income earned by the assets in the trust on their personal Form 1040. Nongrantor trusts are taxable entities for which the trustee must file a tax return (Form 1041). Since its original issuance in 1931, 45 states have adopted some version of the Uniform Principal and Income Act.","Garner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP®;McClintock, Matt, JD;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP®",1,1,9,1,10,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,13-Oct,2013
JFP,Sequence-of-Returns Risk: Gorilla or Boogeyman?,"A common metaphor for sequence-of-returns (SOR) risk involves choosing a ball from an urn filled with many identical balls. Each ball announces the inflation rate and returns for the portfolio's holdings or asset classes for the year. The risk to a client's retirement income plan comes from the chance of having a number of bad draws in the first four to six years. Therein lies the pesky part: there's nothing you can do about luck of the draw. This is a major reason why most sustainable withdrawal rate research can't compute a more generous result at high levels of success. Quantifying the potential impact of SOR risk on sustainable withdrawal rates and/or underlying portfolio values typically involves comparing what happens when a specific return and inflation sequence over a period of years is reversed. For a healthier financial situation, employ dynamic, rather than static, policies to guide annual decision-making about the asset allocation and distribution amount.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Oct,2013

The surtax applies to the lesser of net investment income and the excess of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $250,000 for those married, filing jointly or $200,000 for individual filers. Affected clients can still use exclusions and above-the-line deductions, such as contributions to qualified retirement plans, traditional IRAs, and health savings accounts to lower MAGI and potentially reduce the Medicare surtax. Another suitable way for your clients to mitigate the Medicare surtax and remove the asset from their estate is to gift ordinary income or net income producing property by outright transfer of assets to family members in a lower marginal income tax bracket.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP®, CTFA, AEP®",1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Oct,2013

Drawing on utility theory, this paper analyzes an all cash emergency fund strategy and compares it to funds held with varying levels of equities. This study relies on a simulation-based approach with stochastic real asset class returns and income/expense shocks. The results demonstrate that, when compared with varying levels of equities, there is a monotonic increase in wealth at retirement as the total portfolio becomes more aggressive. Holding a separate cash emergency fund increases the standard deviation of total dollar-weighted returns, as compared to the total portfolio approach. Results also suggest that including equities as part of the emergency fund strategy reduces instances of funding inadequacy. Given that wealth is fungible, financial planning professionals may want to consider the increased efficiency (higher return/lower risk) of a total portfolio approach to managing both retirement and precautionary savings goals.","Scott, Janine, PhD;Williams, Duncan, CFP;Gilliam, John, PhD, CFP, CLU;Sybrowsky, Jacob P, PhD, CRC, RFC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,13-Sep,2013

According to Pink, it's OK to be in sales for two reasons. Since most financial planners are working on their own or in small operations, anybody who is running their own operation is inherently in sales. It's necessary to survive. So that's one reason. The second reason is that selling isn't what it used to be. He thinks one of the things that's important to understand is why they think of sales as disreputable. One of the other reasons people don't like sales, why people often recoil from the very notion of sales, is that sales involves a lot of rejection.

It was important to have life insurance and estate documents in place in the event they died prematurely, but those documents control what happens many months after they have passed away. Developing a tailored checklist for the family to go through at death can minimize stress for grieving spouses and children. Here's some of the proposed checklist for your clients and begin to tailor it to their needs: 1. Locate the letters of last instruction. 2. Notify family, friends, and employers, 3.

JFP,What You Need to Know about the Affordable Care Act and Health Insurance Exchanges,"Three experts to provide the information planners need about the rollout of health insurance exchanges, how the new insurance mandates will work, and the implications for financial planning decisions in this emerging new world of health insurance. Katy Votava, founder of www.GoodCare.com, said that one thing that's going to be quite different for the consumer is making their own choice. Up until now, people who've had a choice for health insurance have had employers preselect one or two plans, and that's it. Arthur Tacchino, chief innovation officer at SyncStream Solutions LLC, thinks the biggest change as far as a planner is concerned is the play or pay tax, which is really the driving force behind employers' decisions about whether to continue to offer employer-sponsored health care coverage or drop coverage and lead people to the exchanges. The main thing for planners is helping clients understand what their medical spending personality is.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Sep,2013
JFP,Using Life Insurance to Fund Special Needs Trusts,"Parents of children with autism, Down syndrome, and other income-limiting physical or psychiatric conditions bear a special burden that is both financial and emotional. A valuable financial planning tool that can address the financial burden, and thereby help with the emotional burden, is the special needs trust (SNT). Typically, a special needs trust is established as a third-party supplemental needs trust. SNTs are created and funded by someone other than the beneficiary, and expressly state that the trustee may only distribute trust income and assets for the beneficiary's needs in excess of services provided by the government. The trust also includes a spendthrift clause, which places the assets beyond the reach of the beneficiary's creditors. In an era of higher tax rates, life insurance can be an ideal funding vehicle for special needs trusts. Although circumstances will vary, use of a maximum-funded, low-death-benefit variable universal life insurance policy typically will be appropriate, especially when the projected time frame and the grantor's financial risk tolerance are consistent with equity-based returns.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,13-Sep,2013
JFP,Simple Formulas to Implement Complex Withdrawal Strategies,"This paper demonstrates how two simple formulas can be used to determine the optimal portfolio withdrawal amount each year during retirement. The first formula, which is called the dynamic formula, determines the withdrawal percentage for a given target probability of success, portfolio equity allocation, expected retirement period, and fees (or alpha). A measure called the withdrawal efficiency rate is used to determine the optimal inputs for distribution equations, as well as the relative efficiency of the formula approach. Results indicated that life expectancy (median mortality) plus two years is a relatively efficient estimate for the expected retirement period and that 80% is a reasonable input for the probability of success. Paper equations capture 99,9% of the relative efficiency of a far more complex methodology and represent a significant improvement over a static approach. This suggests that while simple, the formulas are nevertheless an incredibly efficient method to implement a dynamic withdrawal strategy for a retiree.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Sep,2013
JFP,The Benefits of a Cash Reserve Strategy in Retirement Distribution Planning,"This study investigates plan survival rates, or the percentage of simulated retirement plans, that continue to provide real adequate income at a given point in retirement for two common distribution strategies. Reverse dollar cost averaging (RDCA), which does not include cash reserves, is compared to a one-year cash flow reserve distribution strategy (CFR), which includes cash reserves equal to one year of income needs. Results suggest that cash reserve distribution strategies improve the likelihood of realizing adequate real income when the reduction in the risk of having to sell investments at depressed prices, taxes, and transaction costs outweighs the opportunity cost of lower expected returns. Results indicate that plan survival rates of the CFR strategy are up to as much as 6 percentage points higher than the plan survival rates for the RDCA strategy at the 30-year mark in retirement.","Pfeiffer, Shaun, PhD;Salter, John, PhD, CFP, AIFA;Evensky, Harold, CFP, AIF",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,13-Sep,2013

As a financial plan becomes outdated, clients begin to chafe at paying the same fee for what they perceive as less effort. The real value is in monitoring the planning on how personal, how frequent, and how synchronized the monitoring is to the client's life and circumstances. The return on life (ROL) practitioner perceives that for a financial plan to be a living, breathing instrument, it must be infused with aspects addressing individualized life needs in the context of money that basic data gathering, analysis, and projections alone cannot provide. The ultimate end of a financial plan is that it will comprehend a client's meaning as it relates to his or her means.

In June, the House Financial Services Committee sent H.R. 2374: Retail Investor Protection Act to the full House for consideration.

Never mind that these diversified and well-risk-managed portfolios have enjoyed returns well above long-term averages and far above any reasonable expectations from a financial planning perspective. Most of these facts are grounded in simple arithmetic.

JFP,5 Steps to Planning for Internal Successors in a Small Business Environment,"As the baby boomer generation nears retirement, sole proprietors and managing equity partners are beginning to focus on an exit strategy for their small businesses. In general, the available exit strategies are to sell the business to an internal successor; sell the business to an external party; or merge with a complementary business and sell to an internal successor or external party at a later date. Among family owned businesses, 52% plan to transfer ownership and management to family members, although 50% express concern about whether their successor has the drive and aptitude to steward the business into the future, according to Pricewaterhouse Coopers' 2012 Family Business Survey. Succession planning programs often differ in many details, but essentially, the major steps in developing a succession plan are: 1. Identify high-potential candidates. 2. Define the knowledge, skills, and abilities of a capable successor. 3. Assess candidate strengths and weaknesses. 4. Identify developmental opportunities. 5.

The approach described in this paper allows a firm to provide consistency in structuring the planning process, while offering some flexibility for individual financial planners.","Spivack, H Jeffrey, CFP®, AAMS®;Nelling, Edward, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Aug,2013

JFP,How to Make Your Website Work for You,"Your most powerful marketing resource may be one you overlook-your Web site. Unfortunately, many advisers fail to let their Web site shoulder the responsibility of initiating and developing a prospect relationship. Rather, advisers exhaust themselves following up with ill-matched inquiries, or worse yet, they miss out on opportunity they never knew existed. For service-focused businesses like financial planning, online marketing relies on driving response. Direct marketing relies on three essential elements, all intertwined: 1. List is the people to whom you market. 2. Offer is the hook to attract the target audience member to identify herself and her interest. 3. Creative is the way in which you present your service. Most prospects who visit your Web site likely take 15 minutes in between meetings or a few minutes at lunchtime to address their looming to-do: identify a (new) financial adviser.","Harad, Kristin C, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Aug,2013

SEC have recognized that their examination approach is never going to get them any significant completion of exams in a normal calendar year, so the SEC is taking numerous steps. They will continue to see them leverage technology to do more sweep exams on a particular topic, and then use the data and analytics to help identify risk and where they should be spending their time.

After significant amendments in 2003 and 2009, it has enjoyed considerable periods in the regulatory spotlight due to its broader reach and added complexity, most notably for advisers who may not have previously had custody on their radar.

Prior to enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the portability of a deceased spouse's unused exclusion amount, married couples were faced with a straightforward issue -- the estate tax exemption was a use it or lose it proposition. To avoid losing it, estate plans typically provided that the first spouse to die would leave assets equal to his or her exemption to a bypass trust, which would provide the surviving spouse with lifetime benefits but was drafted so that it was not included in the survivor's taxable estate. Unfortunately, this increased protection comes at a cost in terms of technical compliance with an IRS Revenue Procedure that will soon be celebrating its 50th anniversary -- Revenue Procedure 64-19.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Aug,2013

It's the culmination of a life's work, applied wisdom, and the reward for diligence. It's the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the ticket to a well-funded retirement. Use of the term ""exit strategies"" with a business owner may be akin to suggesting that you spend the afternoon discussing his or her funeral or planning for a root canal. While the term ""succession planning"" remains in the lexicon, perhaps ""continuity planning"" is a better descriptor, framing ongoing and refocused relevance during the journey from now to a new state. Many financial advisers in the independent space do not want merely to sell out and ride into the sunset. They want to transition, stay involved, and keep contributing, while recognizing that Father Time also has an agenda.

Claim and suspend allows an individual who has reached full retirement age to claim benefits and then immediately suspend them, either to put his or her own benefits on hold if reentering the workforce, or to allow a spouse to claim a spousal benefit while the individual continues to work and earn delayed retirement credits. In the ""claim now, claim more later"" strategy, a married individual at or past full retirement age claims a spousal benefit while delaying claiming his or her own retired-worker benefit to build up delayed retirement credits. It is possible that policymakers may evaluate these strategies as they look to trim expenses by reducing cost increasing provisions to ensure they are consistent with the basic goals of the Social Security program.","Munnell, Alicia H, PhD;Golub-Sass, Alex;Karamcheva, Nadia S, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Aug,2013

One of the many things that stands out about those efforts is how seamlessly different law enforcement agencies worked together, seemingly unhampered by politics or infighting. But it doesn't require a crisis to consider your approach to leadership. In thinking about your role as a leader, it's useful to examine it from three different angles: 1. leadership activities, 2. leadership style, and 3. leadership role. It's a lot easier to lead when people have tune to think about their activities and the most appropriate style of leadership to pursue. Considering the activities that define leadership, your leadership style, and your guiding values and principles are key steps to becoming a stronger leader.","Youngwirth, Joni",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jul,2013

JFP,One Life Insurance Size Doesn't Fit All Estate Planning Situations,"Life insurance has been the key asset associated with estate planning for decades. When an estate has been set up properly, a couple can avoid estate taxes on $10.5 million of assets. The critical planning device is for each spouse to have at least $5.25 million in their own name so that regardless of who dies first, their credit equivalent will be fully used. Life insurance works for estate taxes because estate taxes are due when death occurs -- the same trigger that pays life insurance death benefits. But one life insurance size doesn't fit all estate planning situations. If the insured is in good health with a reasonable chance of making it to 100, either the policy's premiums need to be changed so the policy's cash value will equal the death benefit at 100, or a new policy should be looked at. Life insurance is an ideal estate planning asset.

Their disparate research had a commonality; the relationship between high-level performance and social responsibility, between excellence and ethics. To grow and survive as a profession, financial planners must continue to innovate and improve without innovating just to innovate. They must also stay clear on what must not change: the values, standards, and behavior that place the interest of others ahead of their own; that help their clients make smart decisions that serve them well for the long-run -- not just focusing on a mere transaction; that give them good cause to say to themselves and others that they really do good work.","Adkins, Rick, CFP®, ChFC®, CLU®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jul,2013

The first is Google Apps for Business, which includes apps called Docs, Sheets, and Slides for word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation tasks, respectively.

Office 365 includes both locally installed and online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook -- staples of the office productivity software domain.

Automation provides a quick and efficient way to reach large numbers of people. It reduces the chance you or your staff will drop the ball with a client or prospect, and it provides a way to frequently stay top of mind with your contacts with little effort on your part.

JFP,Should Planners Bypass the Bypass Trust?,"The bypass trust, also known as the B trust or credit-shelter trust, has long been used as a key element in estate planning for wealthier families. Structured properly, this trust usually provides the surviving spouse income and the limited right to invade trust corpus while avoiding estate taxation after the first spouse's death. It does so by allowing the first decedent to use their $5.25 million exclusion -- the new applicable lifetime exclusion amount for 2013 thanks to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Not surprisingly, the bypass trust has lost its luster with many planners and estate attorneys, however, the bypass trust could still play an important role in estate planning for a number of reasons. These are: 1. protecting subsequent spouses, 2. asset protection, 3. transfer of two or more generations removed, 4. preventing accidental disinheritance, 5. professional management, 6. spendthrift provisions, 7. avoiding probate, and 8. growth outside the estate.

Investor preferences beyond high mean and low variance is the other source. Both sources of gaps call for investor judgment. Harry Markowitz, who introduced mean-variance portfolio theory and its optimizer, noted that judgment plays an essential role in the proper application of mean-variance analysis. The charade of the efficient frontier involves massaging the estimates of the mean-variance parameters until they yield the efficient frontier and portfolios they prefer. This paper offers the ""efficient range"" the location of portfolios that acknowledge imprecise estimates of mean-variance parameters and accommodate investor preferences beyond high mean and low variance, as a replacement for the ""efficient frontier.""

The factors above create the need for planners and advisers to understand the alternative strategies available to employers regarding health care reform. This paper also evaluates and explains what these alternative strategies are. It specifically addresses some of the following strategies: 1. Continue offering current coverage ""as is;"" 2. Decrease employer contributions to coverage; 3. Switch to a cheaper plan (a plan that has a tower actuarial value); 4. Drop coverage and pay the penalty under the ""Play or Pay tax; 5.

As a planner, you should understand these opportunities to help a married couple appropriately choose between portability and a bypass trust to effectively use both of their applicable exclusions and to protect their families from estate taxes. A portability election can play an unprecedented role in ultimately helping to avoid or reduce a married couples estate and income taxes. It is critical for a competent surviving spouse or executor to file an estate tax return within nine months of death (or within 15 months with an extension) even if no tax is owed. An optimal approach to leverage planning would empower the surviving spouse with the decision-making ability of whether or not to rely on portability.","Herzberg, Philip, CFP®, CTFA, AEP®",0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jul,2013

A simplified deterministic model, based upon the same Monte Carlo capital market inputs (expected arithmetic return and portfolio volatility) can efficiently provide Monte Carlo type answers to retirement income sustainability. The simplified method presented in this paper uses standard deviation for conversion of arithmetic average return to the derived geometric average return for each level of confidence. The deterministic model allows financial planners to easily incorporate customized withdrawal or success calculations into their proprietary workflows using a simple spreadsheet program. As discussed in this paper, the historical success and more recent failure of the 4% rule can be explained by the ratio of the real withdrawal rate to the portfolio arithmetic average return, and also recent market related reductions in the expected geometric average return.","Kasten, Gregory W, MD, CFP®, CPC, AIFA®",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,13-Jul,2013

Now along comes the authoritative book Resilience: The Science of Mastering Life's Greatest Challenges, co-written by Dennis Charney and Steven Southwick. Their book discusses 10 key ways to bounce back from stress and trauma. In examining what makes people resilient, the authors focused on three categories of people. After conducting a detailed analysis of the interviews, the authors identified 10 coping mechanisms that proved to be effective for dealing with stress and trauma.

JFP,The Shift from Accumulation to Distribution: What It Means for Planner Revenue,"For many years, the financial planning industry media have built up expectations of revenue inflows as baby boomers retire and realize they need professionals to help them manage their retirement funds. Financial planners, journalists, and consultants often discuss how the transition from retirement asset accumulation to distribution can create problems with traditional revenue models. FPA's 2012 Financial Adviser Retirement Income Planning Experiences, Strategies, and Recommendations study surveyed more than 440 financial planning professionals in July 2012. income planning. Although the majority of respondents do not expect revenue to change much, if at all, as clients transition into retirement, one-third expect the amount of revenue generated by fees to increase, and another 24% anticipate an increase in commissions from annuity sales. Many planners may see an initial increase in revenue as clients consolidate assets at retirement. Retiring baby boomers are creating demands and opportunities for planners. It is essential for planners to ensure their business structure, processes, and plans can support expectations.","King, Rebecca",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jun,2013

JFP,An Intuitive Examination of Downside Risk,"This paper offers insight regarding several unresolved issues related to downside risk evaluation. Specifically the authors provide clarity to semivariance, which is a well-known, but often misunderstood risk measure. They examine the calculation methodology for both semivariance and semideviation and give practical financial planning interpretations. Semideviation is used in the Sortino ratio, which assesses return per unit of downside risk. The Sortino ratio is pervasive and well understood, but they question whether a majority of practitioners can make an accurate calculation of the semideviation measure. Popular asset class returns from 1926-2011 are examined, and we find that while small company stocks and large company stocks have similar Sharpe ratios, small stocks have superior Sortino ratios. The information ratio is an important measure of active fund manager performance. We suggest replacing the standard deviation of active return with the semideviation. A real-world example demonstrates the value of this revised metric.","Washer, Kenneth M, DBA, CFP, CFA, CPA;Johnson, Robert R, PhD, CFA, CAIA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jun,2013
JFP,More than Enough Money,"Again and again, clients need advisors to communicate in ways that range from simple to savvy to sophisticated. Relating this to the analytical and the behavioral forces of retirement income planning leads the author to an inescapable conclusion: it is exceedingly likely that many of their current and future retired clients will leave behind more money at the end of their lives than they can possibly imagine today. This is because there is possibly no area of financial planning where the behavioral and analytical forces move so strongly in the same direction. In their client relationships, they are asked to show skill and nimbleness in situations teeming with the fear of scarcity as well as the possibility of abundance. The ongoing client relationships at the heart of the financial planning process are ideally suited for the conversations that can help clients see what is happening, if they are able to let them.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,5,1,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jun,2013
JFP,The 4 Percent Rule Is Not Safe in a Low-Yield World,"The safety of a 4% initial withdrawal strategy depends on asset return assumptions. Using historical averages to guide simulations for failure rates for retirees spending an inflation-adjusted 4% of retirement date assets over 30 years results in an estimated failure rate of about 6%. This modest projected failure rate rises sharply if real returns decline. As of January 2013, intermediate-term real interest rates were about 4% less than the historical average used in previous simulations. Calibrating bond returns to the January 2013 yields offered on five-year TIPS to match the duration of bond investments used in previous simulations, while maintaining the historical equity premium, causes the projected failure rate for retirement account withdrawals to jump to 57%. Results from this analysis suggest that the 4% rule cannot be treated as a safe initial withdrawal rate.","Finke, Michael, PHD, CFP;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA;Blanchett, David M, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jun,2013

Tactical, to them, is where they, as the manager of the portfolio, are changing the allocation between asset classes. Jerry Miccolis, CIO, Brinton Eaton, said in their view, modern portfolio theory is just taking what they call the three Rs for each asset class -- returns, risk, and relationships with other asset classes -- and figuring out what the best mix of those asset classes are to get the best-performing portfolio in some sort of risk-adjusted sense. Mebane Faber, CIO, Cambria Investment Management, said one of the biggest challenges in tactical portfolio is sticking with your guns and not letting your emotions guide you to the market fads and the psychology of pain of loss.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jun,2013

This column introduces readers to the initial results of that project: the business skills trust (BST). The BST is not intended to replace family governance of a business or to create a one-size-fits-all trust within a rules-based framework.

When reviewing clients' estate plans, watch for mandatory allocations to bypass trusts based on the current tax exemption. Depending on the wording of the funding language, the trust may require that a bypass trust be created and possibly all of the trust assets be allocated to the irrevocable bypass trust rather than a revocable survivor's trust. In particular, the surviving spouse should consider the potential benefits of making lifetime gifts to use the DSUFA left by his or her deceased spouse. With regard to the use of bypass trusts, clients will need to choose between the simplicity of the one-trust approach and the protections of the more complex two-trust approach.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CFP, CPA;Daff, Leslie, JD;Dymond, Lew, JD;Welch, Julie, CFP, CPA",0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,13-Jun,2013

The way the brain actually works is that practice does not make perfect, practice makes permanent. Whatever people repeatedly think or do gets wired into the habit center of their brains. What they are allowed to do with their mind, which operates within the brain, is they can use their mind to decide what to think to change their physical brain. That's called neuroplasticity. Greed will stimulate irrational behavior, and fear will stimulate irrational behavior. There are many strategies planners can help their clients make better financial decisions, but one is just to help the client deal with the truth of uncertainty. So, the best thing advisers can do for clients is prepare them financially for virtually anything that can happen.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-May,2013
JFP,Controlling the Urges: How Biases Influence Our Investment Decisions,"Behavioral biases are traits or tendencies that influence people to think and act in certain ways. All people have some combination of behavioral biases. Biases are either of a cognitive or emotional nature. Biases are generally latent, and their influence often is subconscious, usually influencing you in stressful or emotional situations, so you are seldom aware of their influence. However, by asking the right questions, you can proactively identify specific biases that may influence you, and take measures to reduce the influence of those biases. Cognitive biases influence the way you think and may be corrected through recognition of the bias, education, and illustration. Financial advisers can help their clients understand their error in thinking by providing evidence of such error and examples of correct thoughts. Emotional biases often are more difficult to tackle because feelings are complex. Emotional biases may be best considered in the portfolio recommendation and investment management phase.","Mooreland, Jay, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-May,2013

Without realizing it, these and other ingrained perception errors can cause them to undermine their own best interests. The following key factors affecting perception of risk provide the foundation for understanding, addressing, correcting, and then neutralizing the impact of many common misperceptions of risk: 1. trust, 2. risk versus benefit, 3. control, 4. choice, 5. natural versus man-made, 6. horror, 7. catastrophic versus chronic, 8. uncertainty, 9. you versus them, and 10. new versus familiar.

Fair enough, people aren't fully rational, but it's dangerous to leap to the other extreme that people are utterly irrational. Numerous money managers have created money management strategies designed to exploit various behavioral anomalies. It would be interesting to see whether managers who have tried to exploit these anomalies under real-world conditions have better success than managers who employ more traditional techniques.

Measures of total risk and downside risk further support the enhanced performance of the minimum variance small-basket portfolio strategy.

JFP,Hedging Longevity Risk for Worry-Free Retirement,"Financial planners recognize that insurance, as a risk management tool, is designed to transfer the risk of uncertain outcomes to an entity that can spread those risks among many insureds. From a financial perspective, transferring risk by purchasing insurance is usually more effective than other risk management tools, such as risk retention and avoidance, when the probability of a risk is small and the financial consequence of experiencing the risk is large. Longevity risk poses challenges for planners and their clients. The nature of longevity risk and methods of dealing with it have changed over time. Over the past 30 years or so there has been a shift away from traditional DB plans toward defined contribution plans, especially cash or deferred arrangements such as 401(k) and 403(b) plans. As the products employed have changed, so have the planning risks. A particularly enticing aspect of longevity insurance is the fact that, unlike life insurance, it is not underwritten, so planners can use adverse selection to their clients' advantage.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CLU, CFA;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,13-May,2013
JFP,"Inflation, Hyperinflation, Adjustment Lags: Why TIPS Don't Guarantee Real Rates of Return","Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are popular investment vehicles for investors concerned with maintaining positive real returns during periods of inflation. However, the popular idea that TIPS guarantee a given real rate of return is not true. Of course, during periods of inflation. TIPS returns greatly exceed those of standard, non-inflation adjusted, Treasury bonds. Nonetheless, as inflation increases, the real realized yield of TIPS declines. The explanation is that the mechanics of adjusting for inflation for TIPS limit the exactness of the inflation adjustment. The adjustment to the TIPS principal reflects CPI values from about three months prior to the adjustment. Such adjustment lags are a fact of life for any inflation-adjusted contract, at least until someone develops the foresight to provide true ex ante inflation data. The adjustment lag mechanics for any inflation protected contract limit all such contracts to being only appropriate inflation hedges. Financial planners should realize that TIPS are just one tool in the inflation toolbox.","Laatsch, Francis, PhD, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-May,2013
JFP,The ABCDs of Retirement Success,"Past research has introduced the concept of ""Gamma,"" which is a metric designed to quantify the potential retirement income benefits that an investor can realize from making intelligent financial planning decisions. This paper continues this line of research, but focuses on the accumulation phase, examining the relative importance of four different factors called the ""ABCDs of Retirement Success."" These factors are: Alpha, Beta, Cash Flows (savings for accumulators and distributions for referees), and the benefits of Delayed Retirement. Through multivariate regressions and constrained optimizations, this research shows the relative importance of each factor for different scenarios. The authors find that while each of the different factors considered are important, they are not equally important, and affect outcomes differently. For example, the relative importance of Cash Flows depends on the size of an investors account balance. They also find that for a hypothetical investor nearing retirement, delaying retirement a single year can increase the probability of success by approximately 10.6%, which is approximately equivalent to generating 1.0% of Alpha during each year of the entire retirement period.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,13-May,2013

JFP,Another Case of Bad Facts Making Bad Law,"Kite v. Comm'r, T.C. Memo 2013-43, illustrates both the potential tax savings possible through the use of deferred private annuities and the difficulties posed by one of the more arcane provisions of the gift tax laws. Kite's conclusion that Section 2519 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) applied to the private annuity transaction appears to be bad law that creates unnecessary doubt and confusion when planning for distributions from Qualified Terminable Interest Property (QTIP) trusts. The decision devotes 18 pages to describing the complex facts. Kite is an excellent primer for the planner who is considering a private annuity transaction. The problem with Kite arises when the Tax Court discusses the alternative argument by the Service that the annuity transaction constituted a disposition of Kite's qualifying income interests for life, which she held in the various QTIP trusts, and that such disposition constituted taxable gifts under IRC Section 2519.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Apr,2013

In particular, it analyzes some of the problems in the application of portfolio optimization techniques to individual investors. The authors then discuss what can be done today to compensate for the problems with the theory, and what additional work needs to be accomplished. Various books and articles have discussed some of the problems with modern portfolio theory, which is the basis for most portfolio optimizers. This article compiles that information into a critique of the investment industry's continued reliance on portfolio optimization tools. Clients and investment professionals alike place far too much faith in the mathematics of portfolio optimization techniques and the recommendations that result from applying optimization techniques to clients portfolios. Clients will benefit from being more aware of the very substantial gap between asset allocation theory and the real world.","Ballentine, Roy, CFP, CLU, ChFC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Apr,2013

The most important thing is getting the vision right -- a vision for all people that inspires trust, the highest standards of integrity and that delivers freedom.

It has become commonplace in economic circles to assume that free markets are paramount, but if any of the sanctities listed below is not held sacred, their economic system fails people as trust is eroded and cynicism enhanced.

Your junior planners, however, should be aware of the following, because the retirement planning needs of the mid-market will be the big opportunity of their careers, in addition to health care planning. According to LIMRA's Retirement Income Reference Book (published in December 2012), investible retirement assets of US households aged 55 and older are expected to reach $22 trillion by 2020, up from $12 trillion in 2010. That's a whopping 83% increase. ""The Impact of Running Out of Money in Retirement,"" a November 2012 joint report by the Society of Actuaries, Urban Institute, and Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement, demonstrates that many of the same issues identified in the first Post Retirement Needs and Risks Retirement Risk Survey in 2001 (now updated every other year) are still with people today.","Meredith, Betty, CFA, CFP, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,13-Apr,2013
JFP,5 Ways to Handle a Long-Term-Care Insurance Rate Increase,"As the long-term-care (LTC) insurance industry continues to struggle in today's low interest rate environment, a growing number of clients who bought long-term-care insurance in the past are getting notifications of premium increases -- and often they're very significant increases, even from major companies like Genworth, John Hancock, Prudential, and MetLife. While the rate increase may be a shock, the reality is that in many cases the coverage is still cheaper than it would be to buy the policy anew in today's marketplace -- which essentially means that even with the premium increase, continuing the LTC coverage can be a pretty good deal. The good news is that given how much more expensive LTC insurance is in the current marketplace, it's drastically less likely there will be premium increases on today's new policies. However, it's still necessary to properly deal with and navigate the rate increases that are occurring on coverage purchased years ago.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Apr,2013

The popularity of stocks that offer investors generous dividend distributions has only been heightened by their recent performance. From Jan 1, 2011, to Sep 30, 2012, the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index of US stocks returned 26% compared to just 19% for the S&amp;P 500 Index. In seeking to better understand the outperformance of high-dividend-yielding stocks relative to the broader equity market, this paper dissects their return patterns and examines returns over a period of more than 30 years through the lens of risk factors. Results suggest that it was actually the value factor that is inherent in most high-dividend-yielding stocks that was responsible for the outperformance of these stocks over the period studied. The yield factor associated with high-dividend-yielding stocks actually detracted from performance.","Fisher, Gregg S, CFA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Apr,2013

Several years later, he read Daniel Pink's book Drive, which seemed to underscore the same point. His theory is that people need to be paid fairly, but beyond that, they need autonomy and meaning. For the plan to be self-funding and accelerate growth, it doesn't kick in unless they reach a minimum dollar amount of growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This number is beyond their traditional growth rate. After they hit this target, they fund the plan. The employees receive their payout based on a combination of firm targets, personal targets, and personal evaluations.","Levin, Ross, CFP",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Apr,2013

That moment -- whether it is a handshake, a telephone call, or an email -- locks in a relationship trajectory that may last for weeks, months, or even a lifetime. For financial planners, it's vital to understand trust. Trust begins and maintains successful client relationships, and distrust, in some cases, ends them. Your level of trust is changed, in many cases, by the way you share information -- that is, through conversations. Conversations trigger physical and emotional changes in your brains and bodies through altering the amounts of two of the most powerful hormones that affect social interaction: oxytocin, which enables bonding and collaboration, and testosterone, which enables your aggressive behaviors. If you build a foundation of trust to guide your interactions with clients, prospects, and peers, you'll realize higher productivity and a sustained focus on achieving extraordinary goals.","Glaser, Judith E",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Apr,2013

Then, the rich universe of GE Capital's callable and non-callable bonds is used to quantify the yield rewards for bearing the risks of callable bonds. Upfront yield to call premiums as large as 4% and yield to maturity premiums as large as 2% are identified.

JFP,A Practical Understanding of Cash Value,"Several recent client conversations about various aspects of life insurance cash value prompt this discussion of cash values -- not in a historical and comprehensive sense, but using various anecdotes to pursue a better practical understanding, including: 1. Cash value is not a bank account. 2. Unattended cash value loans can crater a policy. 3. Account value and cash value are not the same. Permanent life insurance must be managed around those all-important cash values. Use astute judgment about how they are used, and you can get maximum effectiveness out of the policy.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Mar,2013
JFP,The Team Approach to Financial Planning for Families with Special-Needs Dependents,"Financial planning for families with special-needs dependents is characterized by unusually complex challenges. When defining special needs, disabilities cover a broad range of physical and cognitive issues, from mobility to Down's syndrome. With most special-needs diagnoses, parents must plan for partial or complete dependency extending throughout the child's lifespan. A comprehensive special-needs plan, however, must encompass far more than the family's financial aspects and legal planning matters. It must take into consideration the psychological and social issues (psychosocial) and family support needs that accompany planning for disabled dependents. This paper focuses on highlighting the differences between traditional and special-needs financial planning models. In addition, it addresses concerns of working with this complex segment of the population by encouraging planners, with practices of all sizes, to adopt a team approach that can provide the additional legal and psychosocial support required to facilitate the planning process for special-needs families.","Lauderdale, Mitzi K, JD;Huston, Sandra J, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Mar,2013
JFP,Checking a Box,"In the early years of the author's firm when revenues, both gross and particularly net, were scant, he taught finance as an adjunct professor to be able to cover his mortgage payment. He was extremely idealistic and had great visions of changing his students' futures by helping them learn to compute the net present value of after-tax cash flows in complex financial transactions. Box-checking is such an interesting activity. There's one document that most financial planners complete each year that extensively uses check boxes: Form ADV. The SEC essentially uses the boxes they check as the basis for their firms' audits. In the early days of their firm, they probably saw Form ADV as much as a marketing tool as we did a regulatory tool. If you looked at most firms' ADVs from the 1980s, lots of boxes were checked.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Mar,2013

Michelson, CEO of Private Health Management Inc. One can name many world-shaping events, including advancements in aviation, the microchip, etc. Michelson opined that the one event that most greatly affects your life and the planning delivered to clients is the increase in life expectancy. Life expectancy in the Middle Ages in Europe was skewed by high infant mortality rates, but few adults survived past age 45. Michelson theorizes that mankind has evolved over more than two million generations. Yet average life expectancy only reached 48 years by 1900. The US originates 70% of global biomedical research. Leading change is the field of genetics. Since 1950, gains in life expectancy stemmed largely from the prevention and control of chronic adult diseases, including heart and cerebrovascular diseases (stroke).","Walker, Lewis J, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Feb,2013
JFP,Independent Contractor or Employee?,"An increasing number of business owners are addressing their human capital needs by hiring independent contractors. Business owners benefit by avoiding the administrative hassles of employing workers and the out-of-pocket costs of payroll taxes and fringe benefits. With the jobless rate, although decreasing, still hovering around 8%, the number of people willing to work as independent contractors at reasonable rates is high. The trend toward independent contractors will likely continue as business owners cope with the insurance mandate of Pres Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by hiring contractors rather than full-time workers. Several disadvantages exist, however, when working as an independent contractor. The contractor is responsible for self-employment tax, which is a 15.3% rate rather than the 7.65% FICA rate collected from an employee, and the contractor may need to pay estimated taxes. In making the determination whether a worker is an employee, examiners usually apply a 20-factor test.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CFP®, CPA;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CFP®, CPA",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,13-Feb,2013
JFP,When an Ounce of Discretion(ary) Is Worth a Pound of Core,"Additional one-time withdrawals affect the long-term sustainability of the clients retirement income because they are drawn from the same assets that are being asked to generate income month after month, year after year. A withdrawal is a withdrawal whether it goes for regular monthly income, income tax withholding, or a one-time want. And repeated additional withdrawals, even if they don't occur every year, increase the withdrawal rate -- perhaps to an unsafe level. The problem here is that the planner has too much responsibility for the achievement of the goal (a sustainable lifetime income) and the client does not have enough. The planner can help this situation and the client by establishing some broad yet specific boundaries early on, and then empowering the client to make and be responsible for their choices. Have the client establish a separate and distinct discretionary portfolio that stands apart from their separate and distinct core portfolio.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP®",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,5,1,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Feb,2013

The challenge Winterberg thinks financial advisers face is there's much more choice than ever before in technology solutions, so many advisers really want to get a handle on all the available options and all the choices that are in the marketplace, but to a large extent, they get paralysis from analysis. At the risk of making a wrong decision or a poor decision, many advisory firms and many planners fail to move forward with some of the options that really can push their business forward, help them grow their business, and help deliver better service to clients. Clearly, any adviser using social media has to archive everything, and the inefficient way to archive everything is to try and do it manually.

JFP,"2 Designations, 2 Professions","When the ""Certified Financial Planner"" (CFP) designation was born, no other designation represented this new discipline called financial planning. It took a lot of courage and commitment to pioneer this designation. The insurance industry detested financial planners in the early days. In fact, they rejected financial planning. The life insurance industry lost its focus and undermined its own strength. Its strength lies in being the master of all life insurance products and services, and where that area of expertise critically fits into the holistic financial planning spectrum of an individual's life. The insurance industry decided to be a generalist instead of a specialist. It wanted to lead the orchestra rather than be a critical instrument. There is very definitive turf for the one designation that represents the financial planning profession -- the CFP certification.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Feb,2013
JFP,Career Asset Management: Where Wealth Is Created,"It is more challenging today for financial planners to articulate their value proposition to clients, especially if what they base their relationships on primarily consists of investment returns. The current financial planning practice standard includes investment management, estate planning, risk management, income tax planning, retirement planning, and employee benefit planning. Not included in this standard is arguably the clients' most valuable asset -- their career or human capital equity and the service called career asset management. Today it is more relevant than ever as they transition to an economy based on human capital. When viewing career as an asset, financial planners need to explore the alternatives on the continuum from not working at all to working full time until retirement. As financial planners look for opportunities to add value to the client-planner relationship, along with creating greater client wealth and overall well-being, career asset management is a logical consideration.","Haubrich, Michael P, CFP®",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Feb,2013
JFP,The Affordable Care Act's 'Play or Pay' Tax: Determining Coverage Alternatives,"In 2014, the ""Employer Shared Responsibility Tax,"" better known as the ""play or pay"" tax of the Affordable Care Act, will take effect. The question that has been looming over employers, and especially their employees, nationwide has been whether employers will drop their employer-sponsored health care coverage and simply pay the tax penalty for doing so. Employers have the option of doing this, and sending their employee population to one of the Affordable Insurance Exchanges that have been established under the Affordable Care Act, where health care coverage will be offered to the individual and small group markets. This paper examines which employers will be subject to this new tax, how the tax is triggered, how to calculate potential employer tax liability, and under what conditions some employers will actually drop coverage or keep the employer-sponsored plans that many Americans have grown accustomed to over the past several decades.","Tacchino, Arthur, JD",1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Feb,2013
JFP,A Broader Framework for Determining an Efficient Frontier for Retirement Income,"This paper outlines a different way to think about building a retirement income strategy that dramatically moves away from the concepts of safe withdrawal rates and failure rates. The focus is how to best meet two competing financial objectives for retirement: satisfying spending goals and preserving financial assets. Much of the current failure-rate framework fails to consider the retiree's entire balance sheet of income-generating assets, such as Social Security and immediate annuities; ignores lost potential enjoyment from spending more early in retirement; and ignores the magnitude and severity of ""failure."" The process described in this paper focuses on allocating assets between a portfolio of stocks and bonds, inflation-adjusted and fixed single-premium immediate annuities, and variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders. This process incorporates unique client circumstances, bases asset return assumptions on current market conditions, uses a consistent fee structure for a fair comparison between income tools, operationalizes the concept of diminishing returns from spending by incorporating a minimum-needs threshold and a lifestyle spending goal.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Feb,2013

These meetings is called ""interactive surveys."" If you change your approach, you can make your meeting with any circle of influence highly interactive and professional.

JFP,Brain Activity Suggests Planning Designation Helps Calm Investors,"Retaining client confidence during difficult market times is often a challenge for financial planners. Previous studies have found participants under risk tend to ""offload"" financial decision making to experts. This paper extends those studies, and the findings suggest that the presence of a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) certification brings more certainty to investors during times of market underperformance. The study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to record the neural activations of participants during a stock market game. Employing four different investment strategies, the experiment compares participants' brain activity in regions associated with continued decision making and error detection when employing an adviser who does not have CFP certification versus an adviser who is a CFP certificant. Greater brain activations were associated with the use of a non-certified adviser than when relying on CFP certificants during times the adviser is underperforming the market.","James, Russell N, III, JD, PhD, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Feb,2013

As an organization, they've always pushed and should continue to push more high standards and principles that would ultimately benefit the end client, but also help build the credibility for the profession as a whole, which is still young.

JFP,Examining the Benefits of Immediate Fixed Annuities in Today's Low-Rate Climate,"Immediate fixed annuities (IFA) are one of the oldest and most well-known products that can be used as a hedge against longevity risk for a retiree. Surveys show consumers like the fundamental attributes of annuities, yet a majority dislike annuities. This paper explores the potential benefits and true cost of IFAs based on various annuitization ages and scenarios. It uses two frameworks to achieve this: the internal rate of return (IRR) calculation, weighted for mortality, and a utility function. The paper first discusses the potential value of IFAs in terms of defined-contribution and defined-benefit plans. It shows that while longer life expectancies affect annuity payments, their overall impact is much less than the high correlation between bond yields and IFA rates. Using initial nominal withdrawal rates, the paper examines failure rates for straight life and period-certain IFAs for males, females, and joint couples. It finds that IRRs are similar across scenarios, but level off the longer the distribution period.","Blanchett, David M, CFP®, CLU, AIFA®, QPA, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,13-Jan,2013

He was reminded just how challenging it can be when he was asked by a friend for a recommendation. Two elements contributed to the difficulty he had. The first is that financial planners are terrible at marketing. The bigger contributing factor to the difficulty in searching for a financial planner is something the planning profession has been trying to address. Their regulatory structure is not conducive to helping people find competent and ethical financial help. Regulators ignore marketing that presents salespeople as advice givers.

JFP,How to Help Employees Better Value Stock Options as Compensation,"Employee stock options (ESOs) are often used to compensate employees other than top executives; however, ESOs are complex and not well understood by employees. In a study of 210 ESO recipients from five companies, Financial Planning found employees often value their own options based on simple mental shortcuts, or anchors, that make subjectively judging value easy, but they typically misestimate the true value of ESOs. Options are exercised in the future, so a judgment that incorporates the time value of money leads to higher quality, and often higher dollar, estimates of their value. Using actual employees subjective estimates of the value of their ESO holdings, they show companies can influence subjective variations of stock options by educating employees about valuation techniques that incorporate the time value of money In an experiment using graduate business students who value hypothetical ESOs, they demonstrate that the type of training provided to employees matters.","Convery, Susan P, PhD, CPA, CMA;Farrell, Anne M, PhD, CPA, CGMA;Krische, Susan D, PhD, CA;Sedatole, Karen L, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jan,2013

JFP,Planners Beware: ILITs Are Under Attack,"While the federal government continues running massive budgetary deficits, many politicians have proposed closing the gap by raising taxes on so-called millionaires and billionaires. However, raising marginal income tax rates is not the only path to raising taxes. Closing loopholes is another strategy. One particular tool of financial planners, the irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT), is now under attack and may become a victim of the federal government's need for revenue. Life insurance is typically used for two purposes in family situations: as a hedge against disappearing human capital, and as a means of Funding the costs of wealth transfer. The quest to close loopholes for the wealthy may increasingly burden the middle class, and in particular small business owners, who are using estate planning techniques such as ILITs to preserve the wealth they have created. Perhaps more significantly for the financial planning community, life insurance will lose some of its luster.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP®, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP®, CFA",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,13-Jan,2013
JFP,Defining Financial Planning With the 4 Factor Decision Model,"Financial planning can be defined as a profession that helps people make good decisions. Making financial decisions can be broken down to the interplay of four factors. The financial planning profession is strongly grounded in financial analysis. Money scripts should be considered in client's financial decision-making model, but they cannot be allowed to live unchecked. Emotions form the third factor in the four factor decision model. It is incumbent upon financial planners to recognize the impact emotions have on decision making and to help clients understand that impact. The fourth factor that must be considered when making financial decisions is the impact of the decision on overall wellbeing. The four factor model offers financial planners a comprehensive approach to help people make good financial decisions. Ultimately, everything they do as financial planners comes down to helping clients walk through decisions they are making.","Gehring, Nathan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jan,2013
JFP,A 'New Normal' Look at Practice Growth,"Over the past five years, the financial crisis has wreaked its havoc on the economy and consumers, and US households still have not recovered their total net worth to where it was before the crisis began. As a result, the financial planning industry too has been suffering in this new normal environment, as firms struggle to grow revenues in the midst of sluggish organic growth, rising costs, and the lack of any tailwind from markets that haven't entirely recovered to their pre-2008 highs. Given the stagnation of the asset base upon which much of the industry calculates its fees, there has been a growing trend toward alternative business and revenue models that can better facilitate growth, such as retainer fees and standalone financial planning fees. The combination of rising costs and weak revenue growth is pushing many firms to seek out greater efficiencies, and this, in turn, is fueling an urge for financial planning firms to merge in attempt to get larger with the hopes of obtaining economies of scale for the costs of running a financial planning business.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP®, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jan,2013

JFP,Achieving a Higher Safe Withdrawal Rate With the Target Percentage Adjustment,"Previous studies have evaluated portfolio withdrawal rates assuming a fixed initial withdrawal rate with inflation-adjusted increases thereafter. This study evaluates withdrawal increases zero or greater but not more than inflation. Future increases are contingent upon portfolio performance. A much higher initial withdrawal rate than previously thought possible can be achieved without increasing the probability of failure as long as the retiree reduces or eliminates the inflation increase for years indicated by the Target Percentage. The Target Percentage is developed and used to determine whether the portfolio is ahead of or behind target at any point during retirement. If the portfolio is ahead of target, the full inflation increase is taken in that year. Various adaptive withdrawal techniques that reduce or estiminate inflation increases based on portfolio metrics have been previously described by other researchers. The Target Percentage Adjustment is simpler, more flexible, more precise, and more efficient than these techniques.","Zolt, David M, CFP®, EA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13-Jan,2013
JFP,Tools for Digital Age Marketing,"Successfully marketing to a large audience of prospective clients used to require a budget beyond the reach of most financial planners. Unable to make substantial investments in marketing, planners often found themselves losing an uphill battle to the multi-million-dollar ad campaigns of brokerage firms and financial product companies. Many simply gave up and avoided marketing altogether, relying almost exclusively on referrals to grow their businesses. Today, planners can use many of the same tools and techniques employed by large companies in marketing campaigns without spending millions, or even thousands, of dollars.

JFP,Divorce and Life Insurance Proceeds: Be Aware of the Law,"Divorce and life insurance present issues in financial planning that are complex and often overlooked. Based on the current divorce rate and the current amount of life insurance in effect as of 2010, the financial planner will most likely encounter at least one client affected by divorce and life insurance proceeds. It is important for financial planners to be aware of their state aw on divorce and life insurance proceeds. The reason is twofold: if the client is a beneficiary on a life insurance policy, to make sure the client gets the proceeds, and, if the client is the insured, to make sure the person the insured intends to get the proceeds does, in fact, get the proceeds. It's equally important to know what Is meant by federal preemption and how It may affect the clients receipt of life insurance proceeds or the distribution of the proceeds.","Gradisher, Suzanne M, JD;Kennedy, David R, Esq;Redle, David",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Dec,2012
JFP,"Financial Planning: Do Ask, Do Tell","The financial planning profession should instate a ""do ask, do tell"" policy to encourage meaningful conversations with clients. This policy challenges financial planners to courageously address biases and deficiencies that prohibit in-depth analysis of a client's situation. Asking engaging questions that inspire clients to share their life journeys and listening intently to their responses promotes a productive financial planning engagement. Clients come to financial planners battered by economic circumstances that leave them uncertain about many aspects of their lives. Financial planners who focus solely on the numbers drive an obsession that some magical return, account balance, and income stream will improve a clients quality of life. Financial planners should discuss these facts and figures within the framework of the client's current circumstances and envisioned future. Financial planners can help clients understand key factors when considering a transition to a more fulfilling position.","Braxton, Lazetta Rainey, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,7,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Dec,2012
JFP,Retirement Planning Advice in the Workplace Now a Possibility?,"A couple of months ago, the author went to the optometrist at the new Costco in Ann Arbor, MI, because his eyesight had changed so much he could tell it was time for new lenses. The doctor's assistant used a diagnostic machine to take several pictures of each eye to form an initial prescription, so the doctor had a baseline scrip to fine-tune during the exam. Using technology and employing lower-paid staff to provide the doctor with preliminary information, along with a steady stream of patients, keens the exam fee at a reasonable level. Retirement planners can be doing the same in the employer-sponsored market. Its time to provide retirement planning advice through software that objectively allocates product types for desired outcomes (annuities, long-term care, longevity insurance, and investments) versus just systematic withdrawals.

Comm'r, 109 F2d 99 (2nd Cir 1940), where two brothers created irrevocable trusts for each other. Each trust provided that the trustee was to pay the income to the other brother for life, with remainder to that brother's issue. Each brother transferred substantially identical stocks and bonds into the trust for the other brother. When the first brother died, the IRS ""uncrossed"" the trusts, finding that each trust was the quid pro quo for the other. As a result, the deceased brother was treated as if he had created the trust for his benefit, with the result that the trust was includable in his gross estate under the predecessor to IRC section 2036(a)(1), which includes property transferred with a retained life estate.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Dec,2012

At the time of this writing, there are two potentially closing windows to watch. Unless Congress acts soon, the first window closes automatically Dec 31, 2012. Pres Obama supported estate planning proposals during his first term. Working with a compromising Congress, he could succeed in legislation related to some or all of them in his second term. When these windows close depends on Congress. If your clients have been contemplating these strategies, now may be the time to implement them.

Two techniques that increase the usefulness of retirement analysis are the Monte Carlo method and scenario analysis. The Monte Carlo technique creates multiple iterations of a particular scenario and yields a likelihood of success. Scenario analysis allows one to modify the inputs to the Monte Carlo analysis to create alternative situations, each with its own success rate. Most financial planning software packages offer Monte Carlo simulations, and many permit scenario analysis as well. The process of creating, implementing, and tracking a retirement plan, as with any financial plan, not only increases the odds of success, but also gives both client and adviser piece of mind.

Jonathan T. Guyton, CFP, principal of Cornerstone Wealth Advisors Inc, whose research showed how systematic, dynamic decision rules may generate higher safe withdrawal rates, says a mean initial sustainable withdrawal rate of 4.07% in 2012 is nothing to raise an eyebrow at, if this is the rate used by planners who only and always adjust for inflation.

The study required advisers to anonymously disclose the percent of their clients in retirement who in the past 12 months became re-employed, significantly adjusted their lifestyle due to economic conditions, or made no significant changes to their retirement status or lifestyle. Advisers who experienced less success were likely to be using an essential-versus-discretionary income approach.

JFP,Transition Through Old Age in a Dynamic Retirement Distribution Model,Past research on the topic of sustainable withdrawal rates has primarily focused on longer distribution periods that apply to younger retirees. This research project seeks to answer the following questions regarding superannuation (continuing to survive and live into very old ages). 1. What does the withdrawal rate profile need to look like for a retiree who survives into extreme old age? 2. What should the withdrawal rate sequence be to sustain portfolio values sufficient to continue cash flows from old retirement ages throughout superannuation? Equity allocations above 50% cause an allocation volatility drag on optimal withdrawal rates. High cash flows early in retirement deplete portfolio values and reduce cash flows during later retirement years. This paper develops a longevity-based methodology to rationally restrain the early age withdrawals to improve portfolio survivability later in retirement with transition between the two stages in the mid-70s.,"Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP;Mitchell, John B, DBA;Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,12-Dec,2012

In the modern era, money is created not by going out and finding physical things, but by entering into credit relations, entering into contracts that are based on credit, and money is created essentially out of thin air. When ask what are the policy recommendations of modern money theory, his personal position is to allow the private sector to come as close as it can to achieving full employment. That's the goal for any macro economist. You want to see an economy that operates at its potential. Any economy can be examined by looking at three sectors: the domestic private sector, the domestic public sector, and the foreign sector. Money flows within and between those sectors.","Corbin, Mary K",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Nov,2012

JFP,How Clients' Money Scripts Predict Their Financial Behaviors,"  It is common knowledge that psychological traits may interfere with the financial planning process. This study examines the association between money scripts and disordered money behaviors. By identifying the association between money scripts and financial behaviors, practitioners can quickly identify clients who may be at risk for disordered money behaviors based on an assessment of their money scripts. To further assist planners in identifying problematic money scripts and behaviors among their clients, the authors tested the association among respondents' profession and their financial psychological profile. Money scripts, a term coined by financial psychologists Brad Klontz and Ted Klontz, are core beliefs about money that drive financial behaviors. When money scripts are developed in response to an emotionally charged, dramatic, or traumatic personal, family, or cultural financial flashpoint, money scripts can become resistant to change, even when they are self-destructive.","Klontz, Bradley T, PsyD, CFP;Britt, Sonya L, PhD, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Nov,2012

Right off the bat, a targeted successor views a business through a very different lens than someone beginning to plan a transition. They may have significant changes they would like to undertake with the firm to prepare it for the next 20, 30, even 40 years, while the existing owner sees a relatively short time horizon to maximize or maintain their firm's value before walking away. Young planners often do not realize the magnitude of the changes they are asking for, particularly when there is no guarantee those changes will actually have a positive impact. The closer your business matches your successor's vision, the more they will be willing to pay for it. After all, people are willing to pay more for something they want, rather than what you want.","Pitzl, Joe, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Nov,2012

But it is information clients need to understand to make informed decisions regarding their permanent life insurance. Proper management of a policy depends on understanding how a policy matures, other than death. But this isn't one-size-fits all. How a policy matures depends on the type of policy. Many universal life (UL) policies sold in the 1980s and early 1990s have age-95 maturities. However, unlike participating whole life, UL funding (target premiums) is the responsibility of the policy owner, and without astute management, this funding always gets messed up. As presented by life insurance agents, policies may seem quite simple. But for many types of policies, complexity is a given. Among the complexities is properly managing a policy's maturity. This can be handled with experience, good sense, and patience.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Nov,2012
JFP,The Key to the Profession,"The transactional model has been used by insurance and securities regulators for over 70 years. It's based on rules that can be proven to have been followed, or not. But financial planning is not merely a transaction; it is data gathering, it is analysis, it is advice, it is experienced judgment, it is a professional relationship. For financial planning to ever actually be regulated, the focus also will have to be on a standard of care and on process, not merely transactions. Ironically, that was the original intent almost 20 years ago when Financial Planning Practice Standards were conceived. They took seven years to develop, but were then pretty much put on the shelf. These standards hold the key to moving forward with any meaningful regulation of financial planners and, more importantly, in causing financial planning to be recognized by the public as a profession.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Nov,2012

High-yield bond fund investors appear to have a steady focus on performance throughout all sorts of different economic and interest-rate environments. Intermediate-bond fund flows are a more nuanced and confusing story. The full period correlation of 0.10 indicates an extremely mild positive correlation. High-yield returns have been correlated with equity returns in the past. When rates rise, if they are accompanied by a rise in stock prices, it wouldn't be surprising if the final impact on flows is more muted. It's not obvious how to empirically test these propositions, but given the variability in the sub-period results and the low correlation over the full period, it is hard to draw anything definitive from these numbers.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Nov,2012

On what they consider to be the safe withdrawal rate, Bengen said you have to make a lot of qualifications, (whether) it's for a portfolio of 30 years' duration that's tax-deferred, and so on. He's still using 4.5% because he hasn't seen anything that would endanger that yet, although the possibility of that occurring may be in the future. Whether a 4% withdrawal rate is relevant for complex real-world client siuations, Guyton thinks that it's one of the best tools they have, although he'd qualify it by saying that every retiree has a core element of their spending that needs to be maintained and sustained throughout the length of their retirement.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Oct,2012

They are the transitions experienced by parents and young adults in the process of moving from financial dependence to financial autonomy. Life planning facilitates these transitions and the reorganization of relationships they frequently require. As William Bridges, author of The Way of Transition: Embracing Life's Most Difficult Moments, points out, it is important not to confuse change with transition. Change is a shift in your situation: you move to a new home, get a promotion, buy a new car. A transition, on the other hand, is the process of letting go of the way things have been and taking hold of the new way they are becoming. In between letting go of the old and taking hold of the new, there is a chaotic interim zone where things are not the way they used to be but also not yet the way they are going to be.","Gallo, Eileen, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Oct,2012

And it has been suggested that by following a static withdrawal strategy with annual inflation adjustments and rebalancing, the millennial retirement date of January 2000 could ultimately be just that scenario. Historical analyses must be careful not to place undue advantage on hindsight. That said, the author believes that revisiting the millennial retirement and examining the combined impact of key safe withdrawal research published since then can be both illuminating and build confidence. The use of recent empirically based dynamic allocation and withdrawal policies have had a significant and stabilizing impact on the challenging case of the millennial retiree -- at least thus far.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Oct,2012

Emotions drive their clients' financial decisions. An economist who dismisses or marginalizes behavioral finance needs to spend a week with a financial planner. Behavioral finance is about studying how beliefs, thoughts, and emotions affect the economic decisions of individuals and institutions, and how those decisions affect markets. Usually, people first consult financial planners during significant life transitions like marriages, divorces, inheritances, buying or selling businesses, and retirement. The key words here are ""appropriate education."" Appropriate sharing of your own money stories -- including, ironically, some of your mistakes -- can help build trust.

It is extremely dangerous to assume that success in one thing will automatically lead to success in another endeavor. Look no further than the attempt of perhaps the greatest basketball player ever, Michael Jordan, to become a professional baseball player. He totally struck out in the sport. 2. To avoid a crisis, people must possess the skills required to perform the task they are thinking of doing. If it takes a hammer, they don't want a screwdriver. 3.

One of the main points he makes in his book, ""Thinking, Fast and Slow,"" is that subjective confidence that people experience in what they think and they believe they know is not really a judgment. It is not a judgment of the likelihood that they're right. It is not an evaluation of the quality of the evidence that they have. Confidence is a feeling, and it's a feeling that comes, basically, from the coherence of the story that you're telling yourself. The real enemy, he thinks, of wealth accumulation is loss aversion.

JFP,A Decision Model for Non-Qualified Stock Options,"This paper analyzes various strategies for an individual who holds a non-qualified stock option and desires to maximize the amount of after-tax wealth generated by the option. Stock prices are volatile. Most option pricing models use the stock's volatility as a key factor in the pricing model. The model described in this paper implicitly takes volatility into account by asking the executive to predict the highest stock price that will be achieved within the option holding period. The model also requires the executive to predict the return on an alternative investment that the executive would consider making if the executive were to cash out some or all of their options today. This approach can be used in conjunction with a volatility-based option pricing model. Unless otherwise noted, the model assumes that the executive will exercise options by surrendering option shares.","Ballentine, Roy C, ChFC, CLU, CFP",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Oct,2012

Currently used sales illustrations do not readily provide the necessary framework or adequate information for assessing life insurance policies. The paper introduces an informative illustration format, one built on the structure or mechanics of life insurance policies, that is, that policies comprise streams of annual costs and rates of return. This approach facilitates policy comprehension and emphasizes the need for relevant financial performance information. This perspective is then used to compare historical performance of traditional whole life policies and to evaluate such policies with the alternative of buying term and investing the difference. By clarifying all policies, this educational approach brings new understanding to the marketplace, and thereby contains all the inherent possibilities, such as better value for clients and more opportunities for agents and planners to demonstrate greater expertise and provide superior service.","Fechtel, R Brian, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Sep,2012

That can be true if certain assumptions are met: tax rates are uniform across income types and constant over time, and the client's personal discount rate is lower than the expected rate of return on the assets. Given current tax rates, the compounding benefit of deferral is largely, but not totally, offset by the shifting of long-term gain to ordinary income. This paper explores various client tax situations involving different asset classes and vehicles, and provides guidelines based on analyses of multiple scenarios to determine when tax deferral makes financial sense and when it doesn't.","Silk, Roger D, PhD, CFA",1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Sep,2012

However, they learned that fundamental factors can be used to shape their expectations regarding the intermediate to long term. The insights ultimately led them to improve their methodology for calculating long-term, forward-looking expected returns for asset classes.

Thus, for instance, stocks, bonds, and cash represent the three most common asset classes, as each has different risk/return characteristics and behaves very differently in response to various economic and market events. One of the most common ways to determine whether an investment represents a unique asset class is to examine its correlation with other investments. Given how modern portfolio theory demonstrates that investments with a low correlation to the rest of the portfolio can lower the overall volatility of the portfolio -- even if the underlying investment itself is volatile -- advisers have increasingly sought out low correlation ""alternative"" asset classes and investments to manage risk through diversification.

JFP,Alternative Asset Replication in Traditional Vehicles: How Authentic Can It Be?,"Today, mutual funds created to mimic ""alternative"" investments (usually private equity, other hedge fund strategies, real estate, and commodities) popularized by the so-called ""Yale model"" are readily available to retail investors and, at least conceptually, provide excellent opportunities for individual investors. They have the added benefits of lower fees than hedge funds, greater transparency and daily liquidity. In 1991, 53% of Yale's endowment was committed to US stocks, bonds, and cash; today, barely 10% is devoted to domestic marketable securities with only 4% in fixed income. Initially, alternative strategies were primarily accessible through hedge funds, usually in the form of limited partnerships, meaning that investors had to have a lot of money to qualify. The use of the mutual fund structure itself for alternatives suggests an inherent dissonance. A crucial virtue of the Yale model is the ability to exploit illiquidity, following a growing body of research that supports the idea that illiquid assets provide the potential for higher return.","Seawright, Robert P, JD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Sep,2012

Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, stated that the law's insurance mandate passes constitutional muster under the federal government's taxing authority, although not under the power of the Commerce Clause. The decision has been termed both a brilliant stroke of judicial legerdemain and the worst decision in the history of the Court. Except for rate increases, the immediate impact of the Affordable Care Act may be minimal for most clients. Perhaps one of the most perplexing tax increases imposed by the Affordable Care Act is the tax on ""Cadillac"" health insurance plans.

The SWR is the maximum initial percentage of a client's invested assets that can be spent as a constant standard of living (resulting in a dollar amount that is subsequently inflation-adjusted regardless of market performance) without running out of money when tested over any historical market scenario. Most planners use some version of a lifetime cash-flow projection (LCP), with Monte Carlo simulation, to evaluate the viability of each of their clients' financial plans. The LCP is a very powerful planning tool, and one that resonates well with clients. The conceptual advances in approach that SWR studies have introduced in recent years provide a blueprint for client to make each of these LCP features more flexible and realistic. Clients have choices. They should, accordingly, allow the LCP model to incorporate rules-based decision making by the client as events play out.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFA, CFP, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,6,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Sep,2012

One area where misconceptions are found is with alternative investments. Alternative investments might simply be viewed as the third leg of the investment stool: equities, fixed income, and alternative investments. Managed futures, in particular, are an alternative investment that intimidates many investors and some advisers. Historically, the majority of investors summarily dismiss this asset class without really understanding anything about it, but this appears to be changing. One primary reason to use managed futures in a portfolio is their compelling risk/reward characteristics. Managed futures can involve up to 150 global markets and many different assets classes, such as currencies, energy, agriculture, metals, interest rates, or equity indices. Overall, managed futures are a worthy asset class to explore when building a well-diversified portfolio.

The proposed framework in this paper includes two reward and three risk metrics.

In an article in Financial Advisor magazine, adviser Bill Bengen took another look at the well-quoted 4% rule. With volatile markets, retirement planners continue to seek ""the number"" -- the ideal withdrawal rate from a portfolio most likely to sustain income over one's lifetime (and that of a surviving spouse for married persons). At a time of heightened investor nervousness, low interest rates, and inflationary threats, boomer angst is fodder for creative, empathetic, and fiduciary-based life planning counseling.

One of the problems with earlier attempts to use trusts to motivate beneficiaries to manage money responsibly was the failure to describe the desired results in operational and objective terms. They suggested that part of creating a financial skills trust is to ask the client to describe what each of these skills would look like to him or her in day-to-day life and to use the client's input to describe them in operational terms.

Importantly, there is strong evidence that many financial advisers are not expending enough effort to educate their clients on the risks of disability or putting a plan in place to mitigate their financial impact.

Two individuals who are ""married"" receive beneficial treatment in several financial areas as compared to two unmarried individuals who form a household.

JFP,The Impact of the Broker-Dealer Fiduciary Standard on Financial Advice,"Financial advisers provide expert assistance selecting financial instruments for retail customers. Registered representatives of broker-dealers facilitate the sale of securities and often provide financial advice to clients who are less knowledgeable about the product. This imbalance of information has led to the imposition of a legal fiduciary standard when an informed agent is hired to make decisions on behalf of a less-informed client (Frankel 1983). In the absence of an informational imbalance between registered representatives (or brokers) and their customers, the primary service provided through broker-dealers is to sell retail financial products demanded by the customer. The difference in regulation between investment advisers and brokers affects the market for financial advice.

To put them into context, think back to the advertising campaigns of the 1980s: if you were fortunate enough to find yourself at a major sporting event, the dining room of a prestigious country club, or attending a party on a yacht the size of a whale, you might become the beneficiary of information available only to a select few (also known as ""their customers""). The newer crop of advertisements are healthy indicators that large financial firms are finally seeing an important truth: the achievement of important financial goals isn't accomplished by either gaining unfair advantage or randomly throwing money at an investment product du jour, and just hoping you have enough in order to retire.

But many of these products share some common characteristics that are not found in traditional marked-to-market products.

Subscribing to services delivered exclusively through the Internet can yield a variety of benefits, but many planners remain concerned about the security of information stored in the cloud. If due diligence isn't performed on a cloud provider's security practices, private and confidential information about clients, planners, or even the firm itself may be compromised and exploited by intruders. One can reasonably identify individuals responsible for the security of computers, servers, and software applications physically located in a financial planning firm, including the data and information stored within them. Whenever possible, use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and HTTPS connections for Web-based tools, advises Brad Burgess, director of software development for Orion Advisor Services LLC, a back-office portfolio service bureau for financial planners. Before planners start storing clients' personal information on cloud services, Burgess advises that planners request and review a provider's corporate security documents.","Winterberg, Bill, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Jul,2012

The client must have capacity to execute these legal documents. Otherwise, the validity of the documents could be questioned by heirs and the courts. A higher standard, the capacity to enter a contract, is generally required to execute a revocable living trust. This standard describes much higher cognitive function than needed to sign a will. Some individuals who want to remain in control as long as possible or who are concerned about others making decisions for them prefer a conservative standard, whereas others who have been in long-term relationships and are confident in their decision makers are comfortable with an easier process.

Over time, the author have found that the first step in any conversation is to define what alternatives means. The term has evolved quite a bit over the years. Not that long ago, alternatives might have meant emerging markets. Now common, the asset class was not always so well understood; it was perceived as risky and scary by many clients and advisers. Most asset classes have been pretty well explored and colonized. There are stock and bond funds that specialize in what are now called frontier markets. Once you get into Yemen, for example, you've pretty much hit the limits of diversification. Likewise, size classes have largely been explored, with company sizes down to micro-cap and all sorts of splits in size, industry, style, and what have you. Weird and scary or not, the success of alternatives lies in their contribution to the risk-adjusted returns of your clients portfolios.","McMillan, Brad, CFA, CAIA, MAI, AIF®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,12-Jun,2012

JFP,Financial Planning: A Look from the Outside In,"Economics offers a full body of knowledge about securing lifetime financial security for an individual that, oddly, is not incorporated into their financial planning body of knowledge. The theory, known as the Bodie Merton Samuelson theory of life-cycle saving and investing (LCSI), has been well settled in the economic literature since at least the 1970's. LCSI further focuses on optimizing earned income, matching investment risk to goals, and optimizing spending over one's lifetime. These are the core planning tasks in the LCSI theoretical model. If human capital is the primary determinant of long-term financial well-being, then a corollary is that human capital also needs to be managed, cultivated, and protected. The emphasis on human capital in the LCSI theory also positions life planning as central to the advisory mission. Life planning focuses on values clarification and goal specification and thus, like LCSI theory, puts the individual as the focus of attention.","Hogan, Paula H, CFP®, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Jun,2012
JFP,You Must Know How to 'Sell' to Develop Your Business,"One void in many financial planners' skill sets is the ability to convince someone they should use you instead of the planner across town. One reality about clients relates to their comfort zones. When you first start to work with them they are most likely ""sifting"" right in the middle of their comfort zones. That presents a problem to you, the planner, because clients will likely have to expand their comfort zones to reach their goals. One of the most critical tasks you have is to expand a client's comfort zone to include what is needed to realize his or her goals. At least four actions will accomplish this: 1. education, 2. participation, 3. visioning, and 4. building trust. Combining proven sales processes with these proven client concepts will help you obtain and keep clients.

With no place to hide at the time, traditional market lore offered satirical consolation -- the only thing that goes up in a down market is correlations. Testing this lore, the FPA 2012 Trends in Investing study asked advisers whether their correlation assumptions/figures for asset classes used in asset allocation changed since 2008. This split reflects the broader theoretical war, ignited by the 2008 bear market, over modern portfolio theory and its siblings: the efficient market hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model, and asset allocation. Strategic asset allocation promises a longer-term portfolio compound return that is higher than the weighted-average compound returns of the asset classes used to build the portfolio.","Grote, Jim, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Jun,2012

Most of these have unacceptably excessive costs due to high fees, underperformance during normal markets, and/or limits to upside portfolio potential. The area of designing tail risk hedging strategies is quite young and currently experiencing a burst of growth and creativity. A number of portfolio protection techniques work beautifully over the very short term, if you know exactly when to use them and when to stop. A risk management technique that has had a surge in popularity is a variable annuity that provides a guaranteed minimum benefit. But the guarantee comes with a price -- these annuities are costly in terms of their explicit costs and the limit that is implicitly placed on the investment growth of the policy's cash value.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFA, CFP®, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Jun,2012

A trusting financial planner-client relationship develops when the firm demonstrates who it says it is by name and confirms its name through action. Living into a name is an important concept for many cultures. For instance, some traditional African and Asian families spend several ceremonial days reflecting upon the name of a newborn child. Living into a firm's name also involves regenerative processes that keep the firm's transactions aligned with its mission and beliefs. Many financial planning firms extend their surname to their commercial offspring. In this case, the firm's persona should represent a living manifestation of the founder's guiding principles. This naming technique leverages relationships with those who are familiar with the founder.

Think about it for a moment: many have clients with whom relationships span enough years and have built sufficient trust that they may feel quite safe in opening this window for you onto their transition. When they do, it's your ability to use eyes to see and ears to hear that will determine your learning. For starters, it will help to remember that their experience is a transition and not an event.

Yet in his original paper, Harry Markowitz himself acknowledged that the modern portfolio theory tool was simply designed to determine how to allocate a portfolio, given the expected returns, volatilities, and correlations of the available investments. Although not widely discussed across the profession, FPA's latest Trends in investing study reveals that the rise of tactical asset allocation has quietly but steadily been under way and in fact now constitutes the majority investing style. Regardless of how it is implemented, the trend toward tactical itself appears to have grown from a broad dissatisfaction among planners and their clients that the lost decade of equity returns has left many clients lagging their retirement goals.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP®, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Jun,2012

The 2008 FPA Trends in Investing study showed that while nearly 70% of advisers were using individual stocks in client portfolios, only 52% were using cash and equivalents. The 2009 study results revealed that advisers were indeed changing with the economic times. Gone were the days of seeking out the best return. Instead, advisers were now seeking out the best risk-adjusted return. The 2010 study results demonstrated that advisers were also more confident in their current asset allocation strategies. The 2011 study demonstrated consistent growth over the prior four years among ETFs, alternative investments, REITs, and permanent life insurance products. The 2012 Trends in Investing study shows the first noticeable slide in adviser use of cash and equivalents.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Jun,2012

JFP,Sustainable Withdrawal Rates: The Historical Evidence on Buffer Zone Strategies,"The decumulation discussion involves four variables: 1. the amount of assets at retirement, 2. the optimal asset allocation, 3. the initial withdrawal rate, and 4. the withdrawal strategy. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as the correct or optimal answer to what each of these four variables should be. When evaluating different strategies, a common metric is the portfolio success rate, which is the percentage of times a particular decumulation strategy sustains a time-series of real withdrawals. Some financial planners advocate the use of buffer zones -- the use of money market funds to ensure the safety of withdrawals -- as a component of a decumulation portfolio. This paper examines four strategies involving the use of buffer zones and a variety of withdrawal rates, and compares the success of each strategy to the success of a traditional withdrawal strategy.","Woerheide, Walter, PhD, ChFC, CFP;Nanigian, David, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-May,2012

Perhaps lesser known are the connections between CCRCs and LTCI, and why it is necessary to consider them in concert when planning. This paper provides information to help financial planners broach long-term-care risks with clients to determine appropriate steps for helping them plan for care later in life.","Nelms, Linda L, CPA, CMA;(Betsy) Mayes, Sarah L, CPA;Doll, Betty, CLTC",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-May,2012
JFP,Risk Tolerance Questions to Best Determine Client Portfolio Allocation Preferences,"The literature on risk tolerance overwhelmingly justifies the use of questionnaires based on validity and reliability or psychometric testing, but there has been little research examining the relation between questions and actual investor portfolio behavior. This study examines risk tolerance questions based on economic theory, prospect theory, and client self-assessment to determine the extent to which they explain variation in portfolio allocation preference and recent investment changes. The authors conclude that risk tolerance questions based on loss aversion and self-assessment should be used when determining the portfolio allocation of clients. While questions based on economic theory should theoretically be the best measure of a client's portfolio allocation preference, the results of this study indicate that these questions are not very useful when both loss aversion and self-assessment questions are included in a risk tolerance questionnaire. Planners should begin to reassess the risk tolerance level of their clients around age 60.","Guillemette, Michael A;Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP;Gilliam, John, PhD, CFP, CLU",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-May,2012
JFP,How Washington Is Killing Deferred Annuities,"Deferred annuities have held a valued place in retirement portfolios for decades. Unfortunately, the benefits of deferred annuities will decline next year. Changing tax laws resulting from recent legislative enactments, as well as recent failures to enact legislation, are making deferred annuities less beneficial. Financial planners should be extremely diligent in evaluating deferred annuities (annuities), especially for high-income clients. And ""high income"" may not be what you think it is. Annuities have long been a favored product for providing retirement income largely because of the benefits of income-tax deferral. Like all financial products, annuity contracts are valuable tools for meeting client goals and objectives when used in the right circumstances. The pending tax changes that take effect Jan 1, 2013, make annuity contracts a bit less attractive for high-income taxpayers and taxpayers who will become high-income taxpayers in the future.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA",0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,12-May,2012

Technology can be a key differentiator for you and your firm, or it can be a deep black hole into which you drop valuable time and money in the hopes of greater returns. It's a given in 2012 that you've got to have a Web site. It can be as basic as a digital version of your brochure, but it can be so much more. There are compliance challenges and concerns, but it's worth the effort to address these and make your Web site a hub for your digital presence. And now for the ""low tech"" side.

While in China last summer, people learned of the punishment for a man arrested a mere 10 days earlier for petty theft from a few cars in a parking garage. He was executed. Back home, less than a month later, they in Central Florida played host to the circus that was the Casey Anthony trial. As the whole world knows, she walks free today while many people believe she murdered her own daughter, put duct tape over the little girl's mouth, and dumped the child's body in the woods down the street. The contrast between how the two cultures addressed these crimes is striking. Neither stands out as exemplary.

JFP,Seeking Alternatives to Long-Term-Care Insurance,"One of the biggest challenges many advisers face is preparing their clients for long-term-care needs, which can wind up being hugely expensive -- or nothing at all. For those who need long-term care, the costs are taking up an increasing amount of their medical spending. According to the latest study from the National Health Policy Forum (NHPF) at George Washington University, Americans spent $207.9 billion on long-term services and supports for the elderly and disabled in 2010 -- that's nearly 8% of all health-care spending. The NHPF found that 12% of all Americans turning 65 in 2005 will personally end up incurring long-term care expenses between $25,000 and $100,000. But there will be people who resist, for good reasons or bad, and those people still need some form of self-insurance.

JFP,Reality Versus the Expectations of Reality,"A frequent question the author gets from casual investors is why the stock market rose (fell) when the economic news of the day is bad (good). They often assume that bad economic news should result in an immediate negative movement in stock prices, and vice versa. There are a lot of reasons this relationship isn't nearly as tight as investors suppose. His impression is that the financial media do a good job of positioning new economic news relative to what numbers were expected, but the mainstream media, which devote a few minutes in a given broadcast to financial markets, rarely go to this trouble. The lesson for your clients: stock market reactions to the daily flow of news are not so much about the news itself -- good or bad. They are about whether that news was expected, leading to a reaffirmation of existing market valuations, or a surprise, leading to a reassessment of current valuations.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-May,2012

McClanahan founded Life Planning Partners Inc in Jacksonville, FL, in 2004. Financial Planning magazine named her a ""Mover and Shaker"" in 2009 for her work on proactive insurance planning, and in 2010 Medical Economics magazine included her firm in ""Best Financial Advisers for Doctors."" Doctors are more circumspect about the end of life, and that makes them approach planning differently. It makes some a little more cavalier.

This article provides favorable evidence based on the historical record for long-term investors to obtain improved retirement planning outcomes (lower savings rates, higher withdrawal rates) using valuation-based asset allocation strategies. But even if clients or advisers decide against adopting valuation-based asset allocation, advisers may at least be able to use the research findings to help persuade clients to stay the course and not give in to the temptation to change their asset allocation in the wrong direction, such as increasing stock holdings after valuations rise or panicking and selling stocks after a plummet in valuations.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Apr,2012
JFP,Housing: A Potentially Active Player in Client Wealth Strategies,"It's easy to overlook the role of housing in clients' finances. Even though home equity can account for a large percentage of personal net worth, advisers and clients often view it as a use-asset, not an investment. There are a few rays of hope that the US housing market is near a bottom. The National Association of Realtors reported that existing-home sales in December 2011 rose 5% versus November's figures and were 3.6% higher than December 2010's results. Mortgages matter. They're a major expense for borrowers, and refinancing at a lower rate is an effective method to free up cash flow. Even with prices depressed nationwide, homes in some markets have held up well and remain expensive. Most of the advisers interviewed for this article view the home as a use-asset, not an investment. Consequently, they believe that short- and medium-term changes in home values don't matter much to the clients' financial health.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Apr,2012

JFP,How the Social Security Claiming Decision Affects Portfolio Longevity,"This study illustrates how the Social Security claiming decision can affect the longevity of retirees' financial portfolios. The claiming decision or claiming strategy refers to the month in which the single retiree begins Social Security benefits. For a couple, claiming strategy refers to the months in which each partner begins his or her own benefits and, when applicable, spousal benefits. Reichenstein and Meyer (2011) illustrate that different claiming strategies can produce significant differences in real cumulative lifetime benefits. As a result, it is common sense that if you select a claiming strategy that garners more real lifetime benefits it will extend the longevity of the retiree's financial portfolio. This is the first study to provide estimates of how much longer the financial portfolio will last if a retiree delays the beginning of Social Security benefits.","Meyer, William;Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Apr,2012

Base model results show that the tax-efficient strategy is achieved by long-term income stability and characterized by low withdrawal rates early in retirement, sequenced as follows: tax-deferred assets up to tax deductions, the rapid depletion of taxable assets, tax-free assets, and tax-deferred assets, preserved throughout the planning horizon.

All of these variables play into how they do their planning and how they render advice. The only things that they know observable facts. More important than the analytics are the connections with the clients. Flexibility and adaptability can be created in a number of ways. When clients retire, advisors try to drive down their fixed costs as much as possible so they can adapt much of their spending for when they feel richer or poorer.

In either scenario, the clients are using debt to leverage the total assets on their balance sheet in order to achieve a higher return on equity, albeit with the risk that leverage entails. The looming tax-rate environment presents a total upheaval to traditional tax planning. In the traditional world, the standard framework is to accelerate deductions and defer income as long as possible.

JFP,Spending Flexibility and Safe Withdrawal Rates,"Shortfall risk retirement income analyses offer little insight into how much risk is optimal, and how risk tolerance affects retirement income decisions. This study models retirement income risk in a manner consistent with risk tolerance in portfolio selection in order to estimate optimal asset allocations and withdrawal rates for retirees with different risk attitudes. The study finds that the 4% retirement withdrawal rate strategy may only be appropriate for risk-averse clients with moderate guaranteed income sources. The ability to accept greater shortfall probabilities means that risk-tolerant investors will prefer a higher withdrawal rate and a riskier retirement portfolio. A risk-tolerant client may prefer a withdrawal rate of between 5% and 7% with a guaranteed income of $20,000. The optimal retirement portfolio allocation to stock increases by between 10 and 30 percentage points and the optimal withdrawal rate increases by between 1 and 2 percentage points for clients with a guaranteed income of $60,000 instead of $20,000.","Finke, Michael, PhD, CFP®;Pfau, Wade D, PhD, CFA;Williams, Duncan, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Mar,2012
JFP,Be Careful with Correlation!,"At the heart of portfolio diversification is the assumption that at least some assets have low correlations with each other. Having a better understanding of how assets relate to each other dynamically across different environments can help the adviser build a truly diversified portfolio and help identify the times when the portfolio may be most vulnerable. One reason for a dynamic approach to correlation is that correlations can change as fundamental market forces change. A useful way to capture these changes is to calculate rolling correlations over a certain period. There are more troubling problems with traditional measures of correlation. A particularly grievous one is that, in addition to being time-dependent, correlations are dependent on how well the assets themselves are behaving. One way to view this phenomenon is via a scatter plot in which the returns of one asset are graphed along the x-axis and the returns of the other asset are graphed along the y-axis.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFA, CFP®, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP®",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Mar,2012

In general, tech-savvy advisers (high technology users) report that their use of technology has increased their satisfaction across a number of factors, particularly with aspects of professional/personal life, such as day-to-day tasks, revenue- and income-generating abilities, practice growth, client satisfaction, and office efficiency.","King, Rebecca",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Mar,2012

JFP,Daylian Cain on Dangerous Conflicts and the Imperfect Antidote of Disclosure,"In an interview, Daylian M. Cain, assistant professor, organizational behavior, Yale University, talked about conflicts of interest for financial planning professionals. Cain's research found that people do not fully appreciate that many of the problems caused by conflicts of interest are not from intentional corruption -- not from advisers staying awake at night trying to figure out how to bilk their clients. But a lot of it is from unintentional bias. In an original study Cain did with George Loewenstein and Don Moore called ""The Dirt on Coming Clean"", they showed that disclosure can morally license advisers to give worse advice because in some sense audiences have been warned -- caveat emptor. Other researchers have paired disclosures with repeated experience, or the ability to sanction biased advisers -- that has worked somewhat.","Nelson, Christina",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Mar,2012

JFP,"An Age-Based, Three-Dimensional Distribution Model Incorporating Sequence and Longevity Risks","The authors develop an age-based, three-dimensional distribution model that illustrates a retirees yearly transition through retirement, including superannuated years (very old age), to demonstrate the impact of longevity risk. The model developed in this paper demonstrates how longevity probability can be developed into dynamic, yearly adjustable distribution periods and these dynamic distribution periods can then be combined with stochastic (Monte Carlo) real returns. The distribution period (DP) can be dynamically managed, as the retiree ages, by varying the percentiles of longevity. The withdrawal rate is very sensitive to DP, and the DP is very sensitive to life expectancy; thus more attention should be paid to longevity risk than has been in past research. The probability of failure (POF) remains a useful metric to evaluate exposure of a retiree's portfolio to market sequence risk, and a POF-based decision rule applies to both the asset allocation effect and the age effect on withdrawal rates.","Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP®;Mitchell, John B, DBA;Blanchett, David M, CFP®, QPA, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Mar,2012

JFP,Convoluted Valuing of Life Insurance Policies,"The valuation of life insurance policies is primarily associated with gifting or selling policies to irrevocable life insurance trusts and measuring the income tax amount when they are distributed from qualified pension plans and welfare benefit trusts. Aside from permanent life insurance being inherently complex, its valuation is more challenging because it can encourage battle between purveyors of qualified and nonqualified plans and the IRS, each side having partisan arguments that interfere with what otherwise could be a more logical approach. The bottom line for asset valuation is to ascertain its fair market value. In the case of Schwab v. Commissioner (136 T.C. No. 6, 2/7111), the court did correctly observe that ""fair market value of insurance contracts can be a slippery concept."" Because life insurance is so complex, it has been used for various tax schemes that have made setting logical valuation methods by the IRS like a game of whack-a-mole.","Katt, Peter C, CFP®, LIC",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Mar,2012

But in light of the recent hacking incident at Stratfor Global intelligence advisers might be thinking how to combat this. If the adviser's email is going to a business, then most likely the mail is secure. If it is a personal account, he should ask his mail provider the question. Whatever the answer, he should add it to his compliance manual. Compliance regulations require the monitoring of employee email communication. Although this action may seem difficult at first, it is not that bad. Regulators talk about encrypting sensitive information in email. The author personally finds encryption does not work well.

Whether financial advisers want to offer Web portals to their clients, or already do and are looking for strategies to help clients embrace them, the two case studies offered in this article provide best practices for realizing operational efficiencies and cost savings while providing value to clients. The best practices are: 1. Have expertise on staff. 2. Focus on the content. 3. Think beyond reporting efficiencies. 4. Introduce Web portals slowly. 5. Be prepared to help with passwords. 6.

Twenty-four percent of the 407 financial planners who took FPA's Adviser Technology Use &amp; Benefits survey are using a tablet professionally, and 71% are using a smartphone. When asked to describe the impact of technology on their client interactions, almost three-quarters of planners in the FPA survey report that client satisfaction has increased. Advisers like email and texting for obvious reasons -- they're fast, efficient, and immediate. It's one thing to buy a tablet and justify its use for late-night online reading or to appeal to that very special but tiny group of clients an adviser just knows will be seduced by the latest and greatest, and another thing entirely to adopt a radically different business model that relies only on mobile devices.","Lee, Shelley A",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Mar,2012

JFP,A Utility-Based Approach to Evaluating Investment Strategies,"Previous studies on asset allocation for retirement have typically focused on the probability of running out of money as the key evaluation measure. In this article the author develops an approach that broadens the measures to also include the magnitude of plan failure and expected bequest amounts. He combines these three financial measures into a proposed single utility measure. To provide a utility measure for plan failures, he uses the behavioral concept of loss aversion. Results of an informal survey are used to gauge loss aversion. The analysis uses a specific retirement example to demonstrate how the utility concepts are developed and applied. The available asset classes are stocks, bonds, and an inflation-adjusted immediate annuity. The results demonstrate the importance of individual loss aversion characteristics in setting an asset allocation strategy. Also, the assumption about future stock returns is critical. Optimal allocations tend toward 100% stocks or 100% annuities depending on loss aversion and the stock return assumption.","Tomlinson, Joseph A, FSA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Feb,2012
JFP,Dynamic Asset Allocation: Using Momentum to Enhance Portfolio Risk Management,"The best-designed asset allocation and rebalancing systems are not infallible -- they were not designed to meet every market circumstance. Something else is needed when the core assumptions of modern portfolio theory (MPT) are violated. Dynamic asset allocation (DAA) is a response to those times when MPTs key assumptions need to change. Rebalancing, which is designed to exploit mean reversion among asset-class returns, needs to be taken to the next level. A particular example of DAA, momentum-based moving average (MA) strategies, represents a more proactive means of achieving the goals of rebalancing. A specific application of an MA strategy is illustrated. DAA, in combination with modernized' MPT and tail-risk hedging (when all else fails), collectively form the vanguard of the next generation of investment risk management.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFA, CFP, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Feb,2012
JFP,Reversing the Conventional Wisdom: Using Home Equity to Supplement Retirement Income,"This paper examines three strategies for using home equity, in the form of a reverse mortgage credit line, to increase the safe maximum initial rate of retirement income withdrawals. These strategies are: 1. the conventional, passive strategy of using the reverse mortgage as a fast resort after exhausting the securities portfolio; and two active strategies, 2. a coordinated strategy under which the credit line is drawn upon according to an algorithm designed to maximize portfolio recovery after negative investment returns, and 3. drawing upon the reverse mortgage credit line first, until exhausted. A three-spreadsheet stochastic model is described, with one spreadsheet incorporating each strategy. The authors find substantial increases in the cash flow survival probability when the active strategies are used as compared with the results when the conventional strategy is used. The model also shows that the retiree's residual net worth after 30 years is about twice as likely to be greater when an active strategy is used than when the conventional strategy is used.","Sacks, Barry H, JD, PhD;Sacks, Stephen R, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Feb,2012

JFP,Life Planning ... Extending the Conversation,"In 1995, Dick Wagner and George Kinder, founders of the Nazrudin Project, affirmed that money is more than numbers. The word holistic crept into the planning lexicon as they recognized that issues of money and finance should be related to the whole person, to issues surrounding life -- now and going forward. Life planning, financial life planning, and life transitions planning are all terms frequently used. Money conversations should be replaced with life transitions conversations. A business must orchestrate memorable events for its customers, and that memory itself becomes the product. The overall goal in mastering holistic conversations and the precepts of life transitions is to further develop a well-defined, interdependent, and sequential framework, and apply it to a series of client challenges that include, but transcend, traditional approaches to money, retirement, estate planning, and business planning issues. Additional education, and potentially coaching, is central to your growth and development as a fiduciary and as a valued adviser, set apart from the ordinary and product-centric approaches.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,12-Feb,2012
JFP,Selecting and Maintaining Appropriate Fiduciaries in an Estate Plan,"Probate courts are rife with litigation involving fiduciaries. Fiduciaries are individuals or institutions designated to handle financial and health-care matters during client incapacity and to distribute assets to beneficiaries upon death. They are successor trustees of the living trust, executors of the will, and agents under the financial and health-care powers of attorney. However, in conflicted families or in complex estates, these individuals may not be the best choice. Other choices include professional advisers, corporate trustees, or private professional fiduciaries. If a client is incapacitated or deceased, and his or her documents do not specify a manner in which to remove and replace fiduciaries, a court will need to make the determination. Although there are times when clients may want to make it difficult to remove and replace a fiduciary, often they will want to preserve family harmony, avoid litigation, and ensure their affairs are handled as planned by building in other safeguards.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,12-Feb,2012

Neiman, CFP, painted a grim picture of what the surviving member of an unmarried couple might face after the death of a partner. They can become mired in a financial and emotional mess -- destitute and homeless -- all while trying to cope with the loss of a partner. Given today's demographic trends, it would hardly be unusual for a planner to be sitting across the desk from an unmarried couple. For financial planners, the challenge is to know enough to provide accurate and helpful general guidance on estate planning (and related) topics to such couples, but avoid straying beyond their level of expertise -- just as they would with married heterosexual couples. But some planners may wish to take on an additional challenge: boning up on the estate planning issues specific to unmarried couples in order to broaden their client base.","Stolz, Richard F",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Feb,2012

These and many others are from what he calls the mud of the marketplace. It isn't a position, a law, a standard, or a designation that determines a person's honesty. It is good character.

However, nothing grabbed his attention more than this: responding planners reported that, on average, 24% of their retired clients had experienced a significant change in their lifestyle from last year to this. In his experience working with their clients and in talking with colleagues around the US, he has come to believe that when clients trust their adviser they place a very high value on the adviser's interpretation of how economic and market conditions relate to their personal financial well-being. However, the analytical tools and resources that inform their advice on this matter are what he wants to explore.

According to Davey, financial planning is invariably about having to make one or more trade-off decisions. One of the classic trade-off decisions around an investment strategy has to do with three aspects of risk -- risk required, risk capacity, and risk tolerance.

But planners may have their own capital market expectations for future returns from stocks, bonds, and other assets they deem suitable for their clients' portfolios. The objective of this study is to provide a general framework for thinking about how to estimate sustainable withdrawal rates and appropriate asset allocations for clients, based on ones capital market expectations, as well as other inputs about the client including the planning horizon, tolerance for exhausting wealth, and personal concerns. The study also tests the sensitivity of various assumptions for the recommended withdrawal rates and asset allocations, and finds that these assumptions are very important.

Today, Oxley is the chief lobbyist for FINRA. Congress is asking the wrong questions of FINRA. What Congress should be investigating is whether FINRA should be shut down entirely. Shutting down FINRA may sound impossible, but the UK has put an end to the charade and shut down its SRO in regulatory reform.

Sales coaches assist advisers in closing a sale; these coaches were more popular when financial planning was a more transaction-oriented business. Marketing is merely the right skills set made visible. For Million Dollar Producer Inc president Kenneth Unger, the key to successful marketing lies in proactive, regular communication -- mailings, meetings, and seminars.

JFP,When to Start Collecting Social Security Benefits: A Break-Even Analysis,"Many factors affect the decision of when to file for Social Security benefits, including health, personal financial considerations, and employment status. If clients can be flexible in their decision, planners should help them assess the financial advantage of the options available. One method of assessing the financial advantage is to calculate the break-even age. Break-even is the age when total Social Security income from two retirement options is the same. Using break-even calculations, the authors compare three basic options for when to start collecting Social Security benefits: 1. age 62, 2. full retirement age, and 3. age 70. The rate of return needs to exceed the rate of inflation by a lesser amount to justify taking benefits at full retirement age rather than waiting until age 70. It may make sense for a man to start collecting benefits at full retirement age rather than waiting until age 70 if the rate of return exceeds the inflation rate by as little as 3%.","Lemons, Doug",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Jan,2012

The author describe more sophisticated methods of estimating the three principal assumptions used in MPT -- returns, risk, and relationships. The authors also discuss ways of improving the optimization process itself. Optimization process allows for non-normal distributions of returns, and recognize that an investment horizon is not a single uninterrupted period. This allows the optimizer to reflect how volatility erodes returns and show the beneficial effects of rebalancing. This is all just one step toward the goal of bringing investment risk management into the next generation for financial planners.","Miccolis, Jerry A, CFA, CFP, FCAS;Goodman, Marina, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Jan,2012
JFP,Maximize Your Technology Spending in 2012,"The new year typically marks a brand new budget cycle for your firm's operating expenses. No doubt an increasing portion of your budget is allocated for your existing technology infrastructure and to fund new purchases for the year. Although most planners have a good handle on estimating annual technology expenses needed to keep the current tools and systems in place, many don't know how much money should be allocated for purchases of new products and technology in the year ahead. You do not need to spend thousands of dollars to discover ways to grow your business and get more accomplished each day. With a budget of $5,000, you have the potential to gain a significant return on investment with the purchase of the right technology. No matter how much money you've set aside for technology spending this year, you'll find products and services available across various price ranges that can significantly enhance your productivity and capabilities.","Winterberg, Bill, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12-Jan,2012
JFP,Cash Value Life Insurance for the Bad Times,"All financial planners know that life insurance serves as a cornerstone of a client's risk management plan by preserving the insured's human capital for named beneficiaries in the event of an early death. The economic uncertainty that has plagued people people since 2008 has been well documented. High unemployment, low levels of job creation, declining incomes, and reduced access to credit have presented challenges for many. Recently published studies on participant use of 401(k) plans raise concerns that the economic challenges individuals face and the choices they make in light of those challenges may have long-term effects on their financial security beyond the Great Recession. Although cash value life insurance is not appropriate for all clients, planners recognize the tax advantages and typically view the cash values as part of the low-risk portion of the client's portfolio. Still, planners often dismiss the use of permanent life insurance policies during good economic cycles when investment returns exceed returns on life insurance policy cash values.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA, CFP",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,12-Jan,2012

He had a great experience in Florida, where he was asked to join the board of the Central Florida chapter of FPA. He had been involved in his former city, in fact was instrumental in creating the IAFP chapter of what is now the Greater Hudson Valley chapter of FPA. Client confidence, in his view, is critical to their overall success, particularly after 2008. A single fiduciary standard would go a long way toward increasing their confidence. One only has to look at the Dodd-Frank legislation to come to that conclusion. Financial literacy is such a natural for their members to work on.

JFP,The Tyranny of Compounding Fees: Are Mutual Funds Bleeding Retirement Accounts Dry?,"Investments in retirement accounts are plagued by poor returns. An important factor is that, in aggregate, returns of actively managed equity mutual funds trail those of broad market indices. This paper partitions the real total return of the S&amp;P 500 into: return to mutual fund investors and return to the financial services industry. The financial services industry share of market returns increases with the length of investment period. For annual performance lags of 250 basis points, the industry share over 10 years is about 46% on average: over 50 years it increases to 74%. The shares of market returns to investors and the financial services industry are highly variable for shorter investment periods, but this variability declines as the investment period increases. The author recommends that pension plan fiduciaries be required to select default investments with a management expense ratio as low as possible, ideally no greater than 10 bps.","Neufeld, Stewart, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Dec,2011

His good friend and planner J. J. Sessions often says that as financial planners, they're talking to clients about goals. Goals are funded with dollars, and the dollars come from clients who understand their cash flow and budgeting. When people lay out where they spend their money, it's eye-opening. If you can help them identify earlier what their values are, and then look at their spending, they'll realize their spending isn't in line with their values. It's easy to get consensus about goals and the future, but it can be really challenging to get consensus about how clients should be spending their money now.","Boudreaux, H Jude, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Dec,2011
JFP,Improving Risk-Adjusted Returns Using Market-Valuation-Based Tactical Asset Allocation Strategies,"Studies examining the value of active management strategies tend to analyze performance within asset classes against narrowly defined benchmarks; there is little research analyzing tactical asset allocation strategies that change allocations among asset classes, rather than within them. The distribution of expected returns and volatility are statistically significantly different at valuation extremes than they are from the general distribution of returns. As a result, the efficient frontier itself can shift because of varying capital market assumptions across different valuation environments, which in turn implies that asset allocations should change as market valuations change. A basic market-valuation-based tactical asset allocation strategy that underweights equities (relative to bonds) in overvalued environments, and overweights equities in favorably valued environments, can lead to higher returns and improved risk-adjusted returns. The results for improvements in return and risk-adjusted returns hold up on an ex ante analysis and a historical analysis.","Solow, Kenneth R, CFP, CLU, ChFC;Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC, RHU, REBC;Locatelli, Sauro",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Dec,2011

The GAO randomly selected five scenarios from the National Institute on Aging's Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the lowest, middle, and highest quintiles with varying dependence on defined-benefit and defined-contribution assets. The GAO study also identified retirement income choices being made by retirees today: 1. Individuals over age 65 are depending on employment income for almost one-third of their income. 2. People are choosing not to delay Social Security. 3. People over age 60 are decreasing their exposure to equities in their retirement portfolios. The results of the GAO study clearly indicate the urgent need for better retirement income decisions by people who are over age 60.","Meredith, Betty, CFA, CFP, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,11-Dec,2011

A SLAT is an irrevocable trust created by a married person for the benefit of his or her spouse. In order to avoid inclusion of the assets of the SLAT in the gross estate of the spouse/beneficiary under IRC Section 2036, only separate property of the grantor may be used to fund the SLAT. In a community property state, the community should be bifurcated into equal shares of separate property, and the grantor should transfer his or her share of the separate property to the SLAT. Also, to avoid inclusion of the assets of the SLAT in the gross estate of the grantor under IRC Section 2036, the grantor should not serve as trustee.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Dec,2011

Some people are experts at giving seminars, some people work wonderfully with centers of influence, and some people generate referrals. Some practices have many executives, others work well with people in transition, and still others have built practices through specializing in working with doctors. Some people love to get deep into details and work well with others of that profile, and others are relationship people who enjoy forming in tense relationships. One of the things all firms need to confront is the demographics of their client base. Again, if you break down your client base by age, you may be able to create probability of expected future revenue streams. Clients are often initially accumulators, but eventually they begin to spend their portfolios. As you begin to look at your business, focus on the brings you can do that give you the greatest chances of success.","Levin, Ross, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Dec,2011
JFP,3 Ideas for Preserving the Financial Security of New Retirees,"There can be no doubt that the huge generation starting to enter retirement faces unprecedented financial challenges. A confluence of factors will make it hard for many to maintain their desired lifestyles, or even lifestyles they consider acceptable, throughout their retirements. Chronic under-saving for retirement by members of this generation and their higher life expectancy at age 65 are not the only factors. Under current circumstances, financial advisers will have to adapt new strategies to help preserve the financial security of retirees. The key question is whether something more is required, and what exactly it is. After World War II, the basic idea for financial security in retirement had been the ""three-legged stool"" of basically one-third of income from the government in the form of Social Security, one-third from employers in the form of traditional pensions, and one-third from personal savings.","Greenwald, Mathew, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Dec,2011
JFP,Mortality Assumptions: Are Planners Getting It Right?,"In its annual retirement income planning study, FPA asked financial planners what age they typically plan to for their male and female clients. The average ages weren't too surprising: 91.7 for male clients and 94.0 for female clients. It's important for financial planners to know where their mortality assumption comes from, whether it is appropriate for each client, and what the risks are for getting the planning age incorrect. This article provides background for planners who assume that planning to life expectancy is sufficient for retirement planning purposes. Life expectancy is simply a point estimate based on probabilities; people actually die at lower and higher ages. Evaluating planners' assumptions begins with discussing the ""right"" mortality table to use to determine planning ages. There are many mortality tables with many different uses. The best known are the US general population mortality tables published by the Social Security Administration.","Krueger, Cheryl, CFP, FSA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Dec,2011

Study results reveal a strong majority of planners coalescing around a methodology and an assimilation of empirical evidence into practice, as well as a noticeable minority whose thoughts and actions seem very much in flux, at least for now. Digging deeper though, a fascinating set of divergent patterns, depicting both healthy connections and troubling dysfunctions, also come to light and point out directions for future exploration. Planners utilizing the systematic withdrawal methodology (either ""always"" or frequently"") to generate retirement income now outnumber all other approaches by 2 to 1 or more -- at 74.8%. Certainly, for a planner to combine perception (art) with analysis (science) seems entirely appropriate in rendering advice to clients.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Dec,2011

According to FPA's Financial Adviser Retirement Income Planning Experiences, Strategies, and Recommendations study, based on an August 2011 survey of almost 600 planners, over the past year alone 15% of advisory clients nearing retirement have had to delay their retirement date. Ten percent needed to significantly adjust their lifestyle because of economic conditions. For those advisers who had already talked to their clients about the possibility that market unrest could play havoc with their retirement plans -- and had sown the seeds to protect against such an event -- the process was much easier.","Nawrocki, Tom",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Dec,2011

The 2011 study, fielded in August among 595 experienced planners, reveals a general level of success, but also room for improvement.

He hasn't seen anything in the past 20 years that would permit you to withdraw at a higher rate than the 4.5% that he recommends. They'd have to go much, much lower than they are now, or they did in 2009 even, to consider a higher withdrawal rate. That's how ridiculously overvalued the stock market has been for 20 years.

If financial planning is to leave its adolescent stage of development and achieve its full potential as a learned profession, three requirements must be met: 1. It will require a commitment by all practitioners to stay abreast of new research. 2. It will require practitioners to possess or acquire the ability to read and critically evaluate that research and a commitment by financial planning educational programs to impart those skills to students. 3. It will require a commitment on the part of practitioners to partner with academics in identifying the professions most important questions and designing research initiatives to answer them.","Buie, Elissa, CFP;Yeske, Dave, DBA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Nov,2011
JFP,Analyzing Separately Managed Accounts,"Majority of serious studies on investment managers have focused on mutual funds. This focus on mutual funds is at odds with how investors choose to use the various forms of delegated money management. For example, the aggregate amount of dollars invested in mutual funds is similar to that invested in separately managed accounts (SMA). With the advent of high-quality data sets that document the returns and characteristics of separately managed accounts, the disparity between mutual fund studies and SMAs is being addressed. The author's colleagues Jim Peterson, Michael Iachini, and Wynce Lam (hereafter referred to as ""PIL"") provide an excellent example of the new work in this area. PIL studied 3,081 domestic equity strategies from 1991-2009. PIL concluded that when evaluating SMAs, past performance does matter assuming the performance is properly adjusted for various sources of risk. However, there is more to the story. Those managers willing to be more active had better returns, as did managers who didn't get too large in terms of assets invested in their strategy.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Nov,2011

JFP,Probability-of-Failure-Based Decision Rules to Manage Sequence Risk in Retirement,"This paper demonstrates how practitioners can better use the often-overlooked probability of failure as a decision tool. Withdrawal rates depend on the retirees age, and therefore withdrawal rates alone do not tell a complete sustainable distribution story. Probability of failure does not depend on the retiree's age and is therefore useful for comparison of withdrawal rates over any time period or asset allocation. Comparison of probability-of-failure curves, and their shift between strategies, illustrates how effective one strategy is compared with another. The methodology presented provides an ability to evaluate the withdrawal rate and exposure to sequence risk together. The paper concludes with practical applications for practitioners from two key insights: results from a prior simulation would be different for a current simulation (different transient states as defined in the paper) and a range or probability of failure is desired over trying to maintain a steady probability of failure.","Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP;Mitchell, John B, DBA;Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,11-Nov,2011

Given the spiraling US federal deficit and popular support for taxing the wealthy, it's easier to imagine both income- and estate-tax rates for wealthy taxpayers going higher rather than lower. Some tax increases are already scheduled for 2013 unless Congress acts in the interim to change them. These include: 1. ordinary income, 2. qualified dividends, 3. itemized medical deductions, and 4. federal estate taxes. An ideal tax-planning strategy provides sound economic benefits that help clients achieve their financial goals in addition to potential tax savings. These are: 1.

He actually doesn't think there will be too many long-term repercussions of this downgrade. The long-term average ratio of home price to income is around 260%, which strikes him as reasonable. He's not sure there's an optimal level. He thinks they are still a long way from inflation being a problem. Inflation is almost never a problem until the economy comes back near full employment.

Marty recommended they buy no-lapse UL policies with premiums guaranteed to Helen's age 100, when they will terminate. He recommended two companies for the purchases. One of the company's premiums were 20% higher than the other. In 2007, the amounts of premiums were at the outer limits of Doug and Helen's comfort zone.

Clients showing up for their annual meetings with advisers are expressing fear about where -- or whether -- to invest their money. Many are taking larger cash positions than anyone would recommend under any circumstances. To get clients to move put their emotions, many planners try to get them talking. Expressing the emotion helps reduce its intensity, which helps investors engage in more rational conversations with their planners. And planners who communicate more frequently with their clients -- especially during periods of economic turbulence -- have higher levels of client satisfaction, trust, and retention, and higher gross revenue, according to numerous studies. It's also helpful to create contingency plans. Before the market drops 20%, and while your clients are still unemotional about it, discuss what they'd like to do under that and other scenarios -- and put it in writing.","Budgar, Laurie",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Oct,2011

Greenblatt (2006) and Montier (2007) show that stock selection processes can be improved by combining valuation measures with profitability measures such as return on assets. In this paper, the author argues that earnings stability, defined as the historic standard deviation of corporate earnings, is another criterion that can enhance stock selection processes. The author tests earnings stability as a source of alpha for five country-based stock market indices -- as a single source of alpha as well as in combination with other indicators. The paper finds that although earnings stability as a sole indicator has limited use, it can enhance stock selection processes based on traditional valuation and profitability ratios. It does so by eliminating stocks of companies with highly volatile, unpredictable earnings that may suffer from overly optimistic investor expectations, thus reducing portfolio volatility.","Klement, Joachim, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Oct,2011

More participants are deciding to let investment professionals manage their accounts and will likely achieve higher returns and less risk as a result. Unfortunately, target-date portfolios, in particular target-date funds, are widely misused and are not properly understood by 401(k) plan participants. Because of this, target-date funds are likely only a temporary solution to the permanent problem of 401(k) plan participant self-direction. This paper will introduce an automatic managed account solution designed to be a permanent asset allocation solution for 401(k) plan participants.

The cash value accumulation in a PPLI can be invested in traditional vehicles, such as mutual funds, but these policies are often structured to include hedge funds or private equity investments. In 2010, Congress passed health-care and tax legislation that is likely to make PPLI a more attractive alternative for wealthy individuals. First, the health-care legislation imposed a Medicare sur-tax on investment income beginning in 2013 for individuals with adjusted gross income over $200,000 and married couples filing jointly with adjusted gross income over $250,000. The second change from 2010 that will make PPLI more attractive is the reunification of the gift and estate tax applicable credit amount and its current value of $5 million.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFA, CFP",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,11-Sep,2011

One risk, which REIT investors saw up close and personal from 2007 to 2009, is economic recession, particularly if accompanied by credit contractions. Another, although more transitory, risk is REIT shares losing favor with investors at times. One more risk for REIT investors is rising interest rates.

However, commodities are more difficult than other investments for financial advisers to evaluate, and also more difficult to value because they have no baked-in risk premium, says Wayne Lin, portfolio manager and investment strategy analyst, Legg Mason Strategic Real Return Fund. As a result, it's important to fine-tune exposure to commodities depending on the market and macroeconomic environment. David Twibell, president, Custom Portfolio Group, adjusts the amount of commodities exposure in client portfolios depending on the age of the client.","Buttell, Amy E",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Sep,2011

JFP,Advisers Embrace Alternative Investments,"According to findings from FPA's 2011 Alternative Investments study, conducted May 16, 2011-May 31, 2011, with 410 financial advisers who use/recommend investments for at least some of their clients, the majority of advisers surveyed (91%) are using alternative investments. Most advisers (57.2%) use them with more clients than they did 12 months ago, and about one-third (31.8%) plan to increase their use of alternative investments over the next two years. Nearly 68% of advisers surveyed use traded REITs, real estate mutual funds, or real estate ETFs (including global real estate funds) in client portfolios. In contrast, just 32.7% of advisers surveyed use non-traded REITs in client portfolios. It may be no surprise that when asked, ""For what purpose do you use/recommend alternative investments?"" advisers overwhelmingly indicate diversification (95.5%) and inflation protection (67.7%). However, advisers are also using alternative investments for higher return potential, generating income, or for tax benefits.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Sep,2011

A couple of articles from trade publications listed several factors for this, including fallout from the financial crisis and the weak economy. One implied that since some associations have increased their membership this must be happening at the expense of FPA. One of the limiting factors many commentators miss regarding the number of members in FPA is quite simple: the profession isn't very large. There are a lot more people who say they are financial planners than actually practice financial planning full time in a professional way.

JFP,Tax-Efficient Retirement Withdrawal Planning Using a Linear Programming Model,"A common rule (CR) for withdrawing retirement savings is to withdraw taxable savings before tax-deferred savings, but this strategy can inflate required minimum distributions (RMD) and reduce tax efficiency and wealth. However, tax-efficient (TE) withdrawal schemes can determine withdrawals that maximize the final total account balance over a retirement horizon. This paper considers identical scenarios (for example, initial wealth, living expenses excluding federal taxes, Social Security, tax deductions), but use different withdrawal methods (TE using a linear programming spreadsheet model versus CR) to determine withdrawals and federal taxes while satisfying RMDs over a 25-year planning horizon (to age 90). The paper compares the final total account balances for various combinations of taxable rates of return (ROR), tax-deferred ROR, initial taxable savings, and itemized deductions. Results show that TE models can significantly outperform CR when taxable ROR is greater than tax-deferred ROR, initial taxable wealth is greater than 10% of total retirement wealth and itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction.","Coopersmith, Lewis W, PhD;Sumutka, Alan R, CPA",1,1,13,1,14,1,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Sep,2011
JFP,Identify Potential Investment Outcomes with Scenario Analysis,"Financial advisers face a high degree of uncertainty as to how the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial crisis will play out over the next few years, and the range of potential outcomes is particularly wide. Yet against this backdrop, advisers must continue to prudently manage client assets to meet their clients' financial objectives. To assess the absolute and relative return potential of investment asset classes, the author's firm starts by analyzing the broad economic environment and underlying conditions and evaluating the similarities to and differences from prior periods. The goal is to determine the range of macro-economic scenarios the firm thinks have a reasonable likelihood of playing out over the next five years. Meanwhile, it makes sense for the adviser to regularly question his own assumptions and judgments in order to make sure he is peeling back all the layers of the onion to identify and understand all the important variables that could affect any investment being considered.","Lowenstein, Alice, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Sep,2011

Two of the most challenging include the death of a spouse or divorce. In the death of a spouse, there are special considerations. Only certain decisions must be made immediately, and planners can help clients navigate the ones that must be addressed. It's not always true, but often, time can ease the loss from a spouse's death, whereas in a divorce, the pain can continue for decades. Clients who are divorcing are seeking professional help at a time when they usually feel the lowest in their lives. Planners can improve greatly the chances they'll get to a good outcome sooner rather than later. Good settlements address the primary concerns of both parties while equitably dividing property and income so that one party does not become state-dependent shortly after the divorce while the other party's lifestyle continues uninterrupted.","Sewell, Bonnie A, CFP, AIF",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,11-Sep,2011

The study was repeated in 2009 using 12 programs and more in-depth case studies. Software was categorized as to whether it primarily addressed investments and portfolio management, how much to save for retirement, or how to manage retirement resources and risks. The 2009 study found much progress was made in professional programs, but that there is still room for improvement in key-post retirement risk areas.

JFP,Off the Rack Versus Savile Row: The Value of Custom Tailoring for Equity Investors,"Separately managed accounts (SMAs) generally carry a higher fee structure than standard mutual funds, but managers tout the ability to customize accounts as being worthy of this higher cost. This customization may increase returns, or it may simply allow for more personalized tax management or control over other unique circumstances. Very little research exists on the relative return benefit of SMAs compared with actively managed mutual funds. The authors fill this gap by examining firms that offer concurrently managed funds -- SMAs as well as matching mutual funds run by the same managers and following the same general strategy. They find that large-cap SMAs provide no significant improvement in performance compared with the mutual funds concurrently offered by these managers. Although customization may be necessary for some, for most investors an ""off the rack"" approach offered by mutual funds may be the simplest tactic.","Dolvin, Steven, PhD, CFA;Gonas, John, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Aug,2011
JFP,Why Portability Isn't a Cure-All,"The 2010 Tax Act has made it possible, under specified circumstances, for the estate of a surviving spouse to make use of the unused estate tax exemption of his or her predeceased spouse, a concept referred to as portability of the applicable exemption amount. Some estate planners have suggested that portability makes it unnecessary to continue to draft estate plans that include credit shelter trusts. Understanding portability involves mastering two new estate tax terms: the basic exclusion amount and the deceased spousal unused exclusion amount (DSUEA). The basic exclusion amount is the surviving spouse's applicable exclusion of $5 million, reduced by lifetime taxable gifts. The DSUEA is the predeceased spouse's applicable exclusion of $5 million, reduced by the sum of lifetime taxable gifts and taxable transfers at death. Although the 2010 Tax Act provides that the $5 million applicable exclusion amount is subject to an inflation adjustment, that adjustment ceases to apply once the taxpayer dies.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,8,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Aug,2011

In this article, he presents the logic to readers of the Journal of Financial Planning. Separately, he discusses a recent critique of his study by VanderPal, Marrion, and Babbel (2011). Using returns data from Ibbotson Associates, he examined historical returns of four EIA contract designs and 13 contracts for 1957-2008. The contracts came From a 1998-2005 database containing $19 billion of real-world annuities from AmerUS and affiliates. He used the Ibbotson Associates data set.

First, Gen Xers' sense of loyalty is different from their elders. In past generations, employees and companies were mutually loyal and people spent entire careers in one place. Gen Xers experiencing loss and transition are looking for professionals who understand their grief so they can give them their business. They certainly won't stay just because you held investments for their parents.

The regression framework includes variable to predict long-term stock returns, bond returns, and inflation it produces historical data well. This study suggests that, in projecting long-term sustainability for recent US retirees, a 4% withdrawal rate cannot be considered safe when the cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio has experienced historical highs and the dividend yield has experienced historical lows. Nevertheless, there are important qualifications for these predictions. Most importantly, they depend on out-of-sample estimates, as the circumstances of the past years have not been witnessed before. Readers persuaded by this analysis.

Looking at Last Year's Winner,"This paper examines annual returns of US large-cap equities and US small-cap equities to see if there is return persistency (momentum) over annual periods between the two asset classes that generates excess return. Five portfolios are created using historical data (1926-2010) from these two asset classes. The returns of the five portfolios were analyzed from 1927-2010 and rolling annual 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year periods. The five portfolios are: 100% large-cap equity portfolio, 100% small-cap equity portfolio (SC), 50/50 large-cap/small-equity portfolio rebalanced annually (50/50), last years winner portfolio (LYW), and last year's loser portfolio. As the length of the annual rolling periods increased, the frequency of the LYW portfolio having the highest rates of return increased. This paper concludes that annual investment return persistence has existed between large-cap equities and small-cap equities, and this persistency effect can be easily captured.","Garrison, Michael M, CFP;Cribbs, Jeffrey G, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Aug,2011

Based on the results of this study, the guaranteed income protection in a GMWB annuity may be a relatively inexpensive form of longevity insurance especially from a behavioral finance perspective, as retirees greatly fear outliving their retirement income.

He ended up with a huge distrust for life insurance companies and vowed to never be a captive agent again. He kept that vow, but still have maintained his life insurance license for 43 years. The trend to modernization in the life insurance industry is reflected in new life insurance policies and annuities that have ""hybrid"" benefits.

The high income/modest wealth syndrome can become a huge trap in thinking. You see this most routinely with professional athletes. In his experience counseling clients in financial matters, he has observed that the perspective for humans within an affluent environment has evolved their point of reference for financial decisions. This issue makes thoughtful estate planning so critical.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jul,2011

JFP,Data Security in a Tech-Crazed World,"The same electronic tools that have brought so much ease to the lives of financial advisers have resulted in a whole new set of concerns as well. An entire security industry has developed with the express purpose of answering these kinds of questions. Many of the solutions go far beyond the kind of security breaches advisory firms have been experiencing, but that may be what clients need to hear in the end. For some advisers, especially those with larger practices, the safest and most cost-effective move has been to move everything out of their offices and into so-called cloud computing. It's possible to encrypt your software as well -- the applications on which your client files run. This would prevent any hackers or burglars from running your programs at all, whether remotely or within your office. Whatever hackers are doing today to infiltrate computer systems, you can bet they'll have a new strategy tomorrow. Ultimately, data security is about making sure you're ready for whatever comes next.","Nawrocki, Tom",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jul,2011
JFP,When Life Insurance Is an Investment,"Thinking of life insurance as an investment can cause some financial advisers to curse the subject and reject it out of hand. For example, John, 42, is a very healthy, successful businessman with a wife and two children. He has a net worth of $7 million. He is a commodity trader, and his income fluctuates between a minimal amount to $1 million a year. He has a defined-benefit pension plan with $1 million life insurance in it. He contacted the author recently to discuss a systematic investment/wealth-transfer plan that would give him the flexibility of tapping into it in retirement or using it as additional inheritance for his children. For the purpose of this report, the life insurance policy is low-expense Premier Mutual whole life. The dividend rate is 6%, which will change. In John's case, life insurance was an interesting option for two reasons. First, the estate wealth transfer aspect. The other reason is his desire to keep this asset out of the reach of creditors while continuing to own it for his overall financial security.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jul,2011
JFP,Understanding Risk Tolerance to Remain Compliant,"For practitioners, one of the privileges of membership in the Academy of Financial Services is the opportunity to network with academics whose interest is financial planning. Whether you are an adviser or broker, you are obligated to make recommendations suitable to your customer. On one level, suitability lies at the heart of an effective agent/customer relationship. On another level,avoiding unsuitable recommendations is apt to help you avoid legal and regulatory headaches. In recommending to a customer the purchase, sale, or exchange of any security, a member shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for such customer, upon the basis of the facts, if any, disclosed by such customer as to his other security holdings and as to his financial situation and needs. The more challenging work for advisers is with non-institutional clients. Given the impending changes in customer suitability compliance requirements, now is the time to renew your efforts to understand risk tolerance and incorporate its assessment into your practice.","Moreschi, Robert W, PhD, RFC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jul,2011
JFP,A Safer Safe Withdrawal Rate Using Various Return Distributions,"A common conundrum faced by most people approaching retirement is the amount of money they can safely withdraw from their retirement portfolio without the risk of depleting the portfolio over their retirement horizon. The advice that most retirees will hear is the 4% rule -- a retiree who faces normal retirement conditions can make an annual inflation-adjusted withdrawal equal to 4% of the original portfolio without risk of depleting the portfolio. This rule of thumb has helped bring a disciplined approach to retirement withdrawal strategy. However, tests of the 4% rule using simulation methodology have assumed that expected returns are drawn from a lognormal distribution -- an assumption that lacks empirical support. The analysis indicates that a 4% withdrawal rate will result in portfolio failure with greater probability than previously believed, and the truly ""safe"" withdrawal rate -- 2.52% -- is significantly smaller than previously believed.","Athavale, Manoj, PhD;Goebel, Joseph M, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jul,2011

It also shows how to develop a price curve from the data points implied in the yield curve. The author analyzes the effect of coupon rates on bond returns in varying interest rate environments. The purpose is to provide information to make better fixed-income investment decisions. These are: 1. Visualize and model expected price behavior of bonds under varying interest rate scenarios. 2.

JFP,Bill Taylor on Using Your Values to Differentiate Your Practice,"In an interview, Bill Taylor, best-selling author and co-founder of Fast Company magazine, talked about some of his insights as one of the keynote speakers at FPA Experience 2011. For so long, people in so many fields have thought largely about the functional elements of their business. And all that stuff is important. But think, ultimately, the real test today is whether or not you can make everything you do more memorable for people to encounter. In a field that is so fraught with issues of trust and success and all of the psychological elements of life, financial planners really are in a unique position to connect with their clients not just rationally but emotionally. In some sense the only true form of security is doing work you believe in, in a company that you respect, with people you care about and are committed to. His message is it's not good enough anymore for financial planners as individuals or for financial planners as part of a firm to be pretty good at everything.","Ritchlin, Lance",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jul,2011
JFP,Investing in an Age of American Austerity,"The Congressional Budget Office sees debt reaching 90% of GDP by 2020. In a more pessimistic assessment, the International Monetary Fund estimates that US federal debt could reach banana republic-like levels of 100% of GDP as early as 2015. Demographics are colliding with economic reality. With the first boomers reaching age 65 this year, health-care and Social Security costs will rise rapidly. Compounding the retirement income funding challenge, with the possibility of 20 to 30 years in retirement -- longevity risk is the scary new phrase in the risk/reward lexicon. Investment planning will be couched in deeper conversations as they deal with life transitions challenges, alternatives, resources, and expectations. In approaching the challenges of aging and special needs, a growing area of concern to regulators, they need to pay more attention to liquidity. Those under age 55 are likely to see reductions in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs, and planners should counsel debt reduction and higher levels of saving across the board.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,11-Jun,2011

JFP,The Impact of Aging on Retirement Income Decision Making,"The otherwise healthy senior client may experience substantial declines in cognitive function over time, even without clinical dementia. After peaking in middle age, the ability to make effective financial decisions declines. This presents the ongoing challenge to help older clients understand ever more complex retirement income planning. Experts have recommended evaluation of two criteria for determining prudent retirement income strategies: first, clients emotional capacity to deal with risk and uncertainty, and second, their financial capacity to deal with variations in portfolio value, longevity, and income delivery. The authors believe a third criterion should be added -- clients' cognitive ability to grasp and integrate the implications of the retirement income solution. A new retirement income language and presentation skill set are needed to help retirees make better-informed decisions. Because the senior population is so vulnerable, they recommend that all retirement income decision planning and management be delivered by advisers serving in a true fiduciary capacity to their clients.","Kasten, Gregory W, MD, CFP, CPC, AIFA;Kasten, Michael W",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,5,1,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,11-Jun,2011

JFP,Can Taxes Save Dollar-Cost Averaging?,"Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment technique commonly suggested by financial planners and investor Web sites. While much empirical evidence casts doubt on the benefits of DCA, this paper investigates whether tax options that arise because of DCA investing are enough to offset its lack of benefits. The study suggests that although DCA does have a tax advantage over lump-sum (LS) investing, the advantage does not make the technique superior to LS. Furthermore, the authors briefly investigate an issue not frequently addressed in the literature, the receipt of dividends, and determine that the inclusion of dividends favors LS as an investment strategy as well. Overall, the results suggest that in many practical scenarios DCA is not as beneficial as practitioners suggest. On the other hand, DCA is not as economically inferior as some academics have claimed.","Atra, Robert J, PhD, CFA;Mann, Thomas L, PhD, CFP",1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011
JFP,Succession Planning Across Generations,"On the face, it seems like succession planning should be a fairly simple conversation. The community is filled with entrepreneurs who set out on their own and build thriving practices. These deals should be happening all the time, yet all the author seems to hear from planners on both sides of these transactions is theyre not happening. When looking at the prospect of selling your practice, it doesn't have to be here today, gone tomorrow. It's quite possible to groom a staff member to become the owner of your firm. Transition of ownership as well as the responsibilities of managing the firm can come over the course of several years -- if the planning for that transition begins with enough time before your eventual ""retirement."" Internal successions can work, and work extremely well. They need more foresight and time to work than some external sales might, but that effort can pay dividends for your clients and your staff.","Boudreaux, H Jude, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011
JFP,The Portable Exclusion and the Vanishing Bypass Trust,"Last December, Congress made significant changes to the estate and gift tax laws. One surprise was the introduction of a provision that allows the executor of a deceased spouse's estate to transfer the decedent's unused applicable exclusion amount to the surviving spouse. The deceased spouse's unused generation-skipping transfer tax exclusion may not be transferred to the surviving spouse. The married couple must have satisfied several requirements for the surviving spouse to use the deceased spouse's exclusion. The availability of the portable exclusion changes estate planning for couples with large estates in two important ways. First, couples no longer need to transfer assets to a lower-wealth spouse to ensure that both spouses can use their exclusion amounts. The second change the portable exclusion has brought about is decreased use of the bypass trust. The focus in estate planning is now on probate avoidance, asset protection, and distributing the property to descendants in a way that benefits generations to come.","Gardner, Randy, JD, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011
JFP,Power Tools for Cognition,"Most financial planners recognize that, from a quantitative viewpoint, many retirees are more interested in having the greatest chance of maintaining their lifestyle than in maximizing the size of their portfolio on their dying day. For years, financial planners have sought to help clients understand the various types of risk they will encounter en route to achieving their financial planning objectives. For retired clients, this often means that short-term portfolio volatility is the risk to be minimized above all others. Clients experience this fear and frustration; they are real. Both financial planners and product designers are at risk of succumbing to a focusing illusion because of it. Yet any focusing illusion among financial planners creates the possibility of granting this fear such a large voice that they unwittingly expose clients to potentially even greater harms to their quality of life: purchasing power loss and distribution formula that produce fixed incomes and cause mounting cash-flow stress.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011
JFP,Understanding Flaws in ETF Data,"Exchange-traded funds (ETF) are among the best investment vehicles ever created. They offer extremely low-cost and tax-efficient access to nearly every imaginable asset sliver, allowing individual advisers to build institutional-quality portfolios for pennies on the dollar. At the same time, ETFs come with challenges. Anyone who thinks otherwise should look back at the ""flash crash"" or try to explain to his or her uncle why the US Oil Fund doesn't actually track spot oil. These challenges shouldn't deter you, but they should make you think, if you are going to play in the ETF sandbox, you have to take the time to dig into the data. In this article, the author lays out few examples in which following commonly accepted ETF data will lead you toward disaster, and how -- with a little work -- you can find your way around these problems.","Hougan, Matt",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011
JFP,What You Need to Know About Active ETFs,"Actively managed ETFs made their debut in the US in early 2008 when Bear Stearns brought the first active fixed-income ETF to the market. However, the launch was ill-timed and the fund went down with the firm. Active ETF are more comparable to active mutual funds. Active ETFs are funds that have portfolio managers behind them making active security selection decisions about what they hold in the portfolio. Investors benefit from several key differentiating factors as a result of the strategy being packaged as an ETF, including: 1. greater liquidity, 2. greater transparency, 3. higher tax efficiency, and 4. lower costs. Of course, no product is perfect. Active ETFs still have relatively short track records, with the oldest active ETFs being fewer than three years old. Another feature of active ETFs that has raised some concern is their high level of transparency.","Nigam, Shishir",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011

Following the introduction of specialty indices, the latest trend in the ETF market is actively managed products that employ portfolio managers and seek to outperform passive investments; in other words, products that look and feel a lot like active mutual funds. Meanwhile, some fund advisers are considering converting actively managed mutual funds to actively managed ETFs, says Robert Goldsborough, an ETF analyst with Morningstar. Active ETFs can play the same role in a portfolio as actively managed funds. However, because of the limited number of actively managed ETFs, there currently isn't enough coverage of the market and market sectors to entirely abandon actively managed mutual funds in favor of their ETF counterparts.","Buttell, Amy E",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011
JFP,Post-Crash Investing Practices Maintain Favor in Rebound,"The more things change, the more they stay the same. FPA's fourth annual Trends in Investing study proves this adage. The 2011 study of 407 financial advisers fielded in February gauged the investment vehicles used by advisers. The latest findings confirm that advisers are maintaining their post-2008 market crash investing philosophy of seeking not just the best returns but the best risk-adjusted returns with a continued emphasis on stability, diversification, and alternatives to long-only strategies. Over the last four years, a few investment vehicles have consistently grown in adviser usage, including exchange-traded funds (ETF), alternative investments, and REITs. The Trends study also found that 22% of advisers currently use or recommend individual alternative investments (specifically those bought directly, not included in other investment vehicles such as mutual funds or ETFs). Although advisers are not willing to return to their pre-crash investing philosophies of more risk/more potential return, they are regaining confidence in the economy.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011
JFP,Inflation's Shadow: Investment Offsets and Their Risks,"It's hard to turn on the news without hearing about skyrocketing oil prices or rising food costs. Yet government statistics say core inflation is minimal. It's a harrowing time for financial planners, who are trying to determine the extent to which they need to protect their clients' portfolios from inflation and how to do so without taking on too much additional risk. For now, the countervailing forces between deflation in labor rates and inflation in industrial and agricultural commodities is keeping aggregate inflation low, says Ron Altman, SVP and senior portfolio manager at MD Sass in New York City. It's commonly understood that inflation erodes purchasing power, but the extent of that depletion is often underestimated. In the presence of uncertainty about inflationary movements to come, it doesn't hurt to remember the fundamentals and not lose sight of what is within your clients' control: 1. price matters, 2. price doesn't tell the whole story, and 3. think outside the office.","Budgar, Laurie",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011

The First Command Financial Behaviors Index reveals that 90% of consumers who work with a financial planner say they trust their planner. However, the levels of trust are considerably lower among those who do not have a financial planner. First Command has taken a comprehensive approach to client disclosures for quite some time, and Spiker feels like they are very well positioned for further movement in this direction. He believes the key to developing a profitable business model serving the middle class has very little to do with fee versus commission or assets under management. Success instead lies in taking a holistic approach, offering a broad range of financial products and services within the context of the financial plan.","Nelson, Christina",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jun,2011

They have been married 37 years and the kids are fully independent. They have a taxable account totaling $80,000 and a $700,000 IRA. They have this money because they have always lived within their means. They have lots of options, especially with the nine-year window providing the flexibility to withdraw as much or as little of the IRA as they with before the required minimum distributions kick in. Most planners would agree that the strategy of taking money out of the IRA before Bob is forced to make withdrawals at his required beginning date is worth considering, given the relatively low tax bracket that would apply. Beyond that basic concept though, the agreement should stop. The answer is a regulatory structure that ignores the financial planning process and is rendered even more ineffective by FINRA.","Moisand, Dan, CFP",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-May,2011

Financial planners have benefited tremendously from new technologies introduced in the digital age by being able to conduct much of their business while on the go. However, one area of the digital movement that financial planners have been slow to adopt is document management technology. According to Financial Planning magazine's 2010 Technology Survey, nearly 70% of all respondents are not using some form of document management software. Here are five misconceptions regarding document management and explain how embracing this technology can best position a planner's business in the digital age: 1. Server file storage is adequate. 2. Going paperless adds unnecessary risk. 3. Clients want hard copies. 4. Document management software is too expensive. 5.

They've seen recent progress on both of those fronts, but there is still significant work to be done. Americans need certainty in the tax code. The increasingly temporary nature of tax incentives and obligations is a serious problem. Last year, Congress addressed 141 expiring provisions, including such basic components as the individual income tax rates, capital gains and dividend rates, and the estate tax. The need for long-term care insurance will not change as a result of health reform, but as the population ages, there will be an increased interest in long-term care insurance.

JFP,Incorporating Time into the Efficient Frontier,"The portfolio construction process has historically yielded a two-dimensional output, where the efficiency of a portfolio is determined based on its return and the standard deviation. Risk is usually defined as standard deviation and based on a single holding period: annually. This approach to portfolio construction ignores the fact that investors have varied investing time frames. This research will demonstrate that the relative efficiency of a portfolio changes over various holding periods, and that by adding a third dimension to the optimization process you can create portfolios that are more efficient given an investors expected holding period. An approach is introduced to incorporate time into the efficient frontier, which allows the user to easily adjust the input parameters for mean-variance optimization through the use of a simple time decay factor. This approach has practical implications when building portfolios, such as determining the allocations in a bucket portfolio and determining the equity glide path for a target-date portfolio.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,11-May,2011

Using data from ArcaVision, the authors examine whether ETFs with higher trading volumes tend to have tighter bid-ask spreads and whether this varies across quarters or across asset classes. They find that there is indeed a strong log-linear relationship between spreads and dollar volumes and an equally strong log-linear relationship between spreads and total ETF assets. The overall relationships between an ETF's bid-ask spread and both its dollar volume and its assets under management are clearly negative and log-linear. The correlation is somewhat stronger with volume than with assets, but the difference is small. It is also important to note that this study looks solely at the secondary ETF trading market, which is where smaller-balance investors are likely to trade.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA;Iachini, Michael, CFA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-May,2011

While the recent decade of economic crises has caused numerous financial anxieties, the number one worry of retired Americans is uninsured healthcare costs. According to Jesse Slome, executive director of the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance in Los Angeles, a planner has three options for addressing clients' long-term care needs. First, recommend solutions yourself by gaining expertise in the various types of long-term care insurance (LTCi) products available. Second, partner with focal LTCi professionals to take advantage of their knowledge, to access solutions and products from multiple insurers, and to keep pace with ever-changing health insurance underwriting standards.

JFP,Safe Savings Rates: A New Approach to Retirement Planning over the Life Cycle,"Focusing one safe withdrawal rate and then deriving a ""wealth accumulation target"" to achieve by the retirement date may not be the best way to approach retirement planning. The focus of retirement planning should be on the savings rate rather than the withdrawal rate. The safe savings rate"" may be based on historical simulations as the savings rate that proves sufficient to support the desired retirement expenditures from a life-cycle perspective, including both the accumulation and decumulation phases. Unlike the 4% rule for a safe withdrawal rate, there is not a universal ""safe savings rate,"" but guidelines can be created. Starting to save early and consistently for retirement at a reasonable savings rate will provide the best chance to meet retirement expenditure goals. But the savings plan should be adhered to regardless of whether it seems one is accumulating either more or less wealth than is needed based on traditional criteria.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-May,2011

JFP,An Application of Asset-Liability Management for Financial Planners,"Asset-liability management (ALM) provides a risk-management technique that focuses on both sides of an investors balance sheet, in contrast to traditional asset allocation approaches, which tend to only emphasize investor assets. This article presents an application of ALM for financial planners, along the lines of Jones and Brown (2009), using an example of an individual investor who is seeking an asset allocation to best meet future spending needs. This ALM methodology determines the fixed-income exposure required to fully or partially immunize an investor's liabilities, thereby reducing the volatility of the assets required to fund the investors liabilities and the shortfall funding risk of the portfolio. The result takes into account investor circumstances and market conditions in order to allow a financial planner to better fit an asset allocation to the needs of the investor. The goal of this article is to demonstrate this approach and allow financial planners to use ALM in conjunction with existing asset-allocation practices.","Brown, Jack, CFA;Jones, Travis L, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-May,2011

After a November election that upset the reigning power base in Washington, there was renewed hope for bi-partisan compromise that would move the country forward. Negotiations that led up to the enactment of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 appeared to demonstrate a willingness on both sides of the political spectrum to give up some of their demands so that a workable solution for taxpayers could be achieved. Life insurance may be an ideal asset to hold as a hedge against the risks associated with tax-rate changes. It's easy to see how life insurance is a hedge against the risk of early death and replaces human capital lost before the financial benefits of that capital are fully realized.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, CFP, CFA",1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-May,2011

Unfortunately, these principles do not always align with the business reality of firms that sell lending products. In the investment management domain, the industry is evolving from ""sell what you can that will generate good commissions"" to processes for both advisers and consumers that help ensure that the basic principles of diversifying, avoiding emotional trading, and using mechanisms to understand the suitability of investment products are applied in the advice given. Far more so than investing, lending remains a transactional event to apply for another loan. A holistic view is only taken when trying to bail clients out of overwhelming debt. What this paper introduces is a ""Debt Policy Statement"", modeled off of the established Investment Policy Statement process, to educate and set good debt management policies while supporting institutional and governmental lending policies and best practices.","Brayman, Shawn",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Apr,2011

This article lays out the problem and offers solution. Most estate planners and financial advisers have listened to clients expressing concern about the possible negative effects their money has or will have on their children. One approach adopted by many estate planners and financial advisers is to suggest that their clients consider the use of an incentive trust. An incentive trust attempts to influence beneficiary behavior through the inclusion of carrot/stick provisions related to trust distributions and trusteeships. It would be possible to identify behavioral benchmarks or component skills that are not only objective but that correlate directly with the beneficiary's ability to manage money responsibly. The authors suggest the outcome would be the creation of a ROTE.

When retirement planning for the mid-market, planners need to prioritize clients' ability to protect against the additional primary risks of inflation, longevity, health issues, and long-term care before they plan for their investing risk tolerance. Planners who take the lead in shaping the use of retirement income planning processes, products, platforms, and practice management solutions for this market will benefit, as will an entire generation of boomer retirees. Retirement education for mid-market clients should be holistic about how to prioritize and manage the risks they'll face in key areas of retirement planning so they improve the sustainability and income optimization of all their assets: Social Security, pensions, savings and investments, home equity, and even human capital such as their health and ability to work.

Because no methodology can specify an optimal withdrawal rate or portfolio allocation for all clients generally, it is important for advisers to present the risk-return trade-offs in the withdrawal rate decision in a manner that facilitates retirement investment planning. Requiring a high portfolio success rate necessarily requires a low withdrawal rate. In contrast, if a low portfolio success rate is acceptable, then a high withdrawal rate can be used in a financial plan. The principal objective of this analysis is to calculate retirement portfolio success rates for various monthly withdrawal rate assumptions and various portfolio asset allocations from 1926-2009, and show how an adviser can use the findings to manage portfolio withdrawal rates adaptively. The purpose of this research is to assist advisers and clients in forming a plan for annual withdrawals from retirement portfolios.","Cooley, Philip L, PhD;Hubbard, Carl M, PhD;Walz, Daniel T, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Apr,2011

In this process, many have started -- again -- at the beginning; that is, by reviewing all the terminology related to risk as well as the basic definition of risk tolerance. In January, the Investment Company Institute reported that Americans remain committed to saving for retirement, but they appear to have become more conservative in terms of savings, asset allocation, and choice of retirement age. The financial professionals interviewed for this article agree that the biggest impact heightened compliance rules around risk have had involves how advisers document and handle transactions and recommendations they make in response to client risk assessment.

To meet these overall goals of collecting the right amount of taxes, they're innovating in the service arena. A good example of that is this year they have actually launched a smartphone application, which allows taxpayers to access IRS information on their smartphones. At its simplest, return preparers are a critical part of the US tax system and therefore they're a top priority for him as commissioner. Their goal is to make sure that tax return preparers are an integral part of both their service and compliance strategy at the IRS.

What typically prompts planners to begin thinking about the need for a marketing plan is not their psychological health, but a dawning recognition that their businesses are languishing, or at least could be doing a lot better. A strategic review does not inevitably lead to a decision to sharpen one's market segmentation. Frank Patzke, the planner who lost clients when junior associates left the firm, makes a conscious choice of taking on ""anybody who wants to be a client.""

JFP,Change the Way You Ask for Client Referrals,"Financial advisers know that nothing beats referrals from satisfied clients. The problem is that many advisers ask for referrals rather than have referral conversations with clients. Advisers often forget that the reason clients provide referrals is to help their friends, not their advisers. Here are four strategies for making referral conversations more effective: 1. Make it part of the conversation. 2. Seek low-key intros, not high-stress meetings. 3. Bring up referrals at the right frequency. 4. Update referral sources on progress.","Richards, Dan",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Mar,2011

JFP,PRACTICE TRENDS: How Does Your Practice Measure Up?,"In October 2010, FPA conducted a survey of financial planners' fees and financial plan development practices. The average financial planner actively works with just over 96 clients in a financial planning capacity. Sole practitioners, who made up 54% of the planners surveyed, work with fewer clients, an average of 70. Planners working in larger practices handle an average of 126 clients apiece. Overall, financial planners spend the largest percentage of their time meeting with current clients and developing financial plans, each accounting for around 19% of a planner's time. When asked where they would like to spend more of their working hours, the majority of financial planners, more than 60%, said that they would like to spend more time in acquiring new clients and meeting with their current clients. With hourly, retainer, or per-plan fees, sole practitioners charge less than their counterparts in group practices.","McClune, Sheila",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Mar,2011
JFP,Real-World Index Annuity Returns,"This paper offers the first empirical exploration of fixed indexed annuity (FIA) returns based on actual contracts that were sold and actual interest that was credited. FIAs are designed to have limited downside returns associated with declining markets, and achieve respectable returns in more robust equity markets. Studies that have criticized FIAs are usually based on hypothesized crediting rate formulae, constant participation rates and caps, and unrealistic simulations of stock market and interest rate behavior. When actual policy data are used, the conclusions change. The returns of real-world index annuities analyzed in this paper outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index over 67% of the time, and outperformed a 50/50 mix of one-year Treasury bills and the S&amp;P 500 79% of the time. The study is exploratory, because although it is based on actual contracts and actual crediting rates, the policy data set is neither randomly selected nor comprehensive based upon data provided by 15 FIA carriers.","VanderPal, Geoffrey, DBA, CFP, CLU, CFS, RFC;Marrion, Jack;Babbel, David F, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Mar,2011
JFP,Marketing's Magic Bullet? Keep It Simple and Consistent,"If the idea of marketing your practice sends your head spinning, relax. The secret to effective marketing may be keeping it simple yet consistent. Recent research from FPA and other industry sources confirms that the majority of planners have no formal marketing plan. And while referrals continue to be the biggest driver of business growth, the most effective marketing happens as a result of implementing a few different strategies -- rather than relying heavily on just one -- and executing those strategies consistently. According to FPA's 2011 marketing survey, nearly 60% of planners have no formal marketing plan, and only 38% of those without a formal plan intend to implement one in the next six months. While people know there is no magic bullet, it can be helpful to know what marketing methods are -- and are not -- commonly used by planners.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Mar,2011

It takes time, effort, and patience. The rewards, however, are substantial -- strong business growth coupled with a higher level of service for your existing clients. That said, one of the biggest mistakes people can make is setting up a network of professional advisers only with a view to generating referrals. The first step is to define your network needs, and these will differ depending on your clients and their needs. In this case you already have established relationships and your goal is to encourage more referrals. The flipside of this last tactic is a nice segue into the second broad strategy.

About half of firms report that they do not have a waiting period for benefits, bonuses, or incentives. However, 44.6% report a waiting period for benefits, 20.7% for bonuses, and 14.1% for incentives. The most common benefit category offered to employees is time off/paid leave/sick leave, followed by retirement benefits. Most financial planning firms offer a 401(k) to their employees as part of their benefits package. Firms do match a larger percent of the employee's contribution versus the employee's salary. Most financial planning firms (90.4%) offer some type of time off as part of their benefits package.

JFP,Transferring Intimacy,"The future existence of the financial planning profession is not heavily dependent on the founding generation's ability to transfer computers, software, staff, systems, processes, technical expertise, and all of the other pieces of a business for some multiple of revenues. Rather, the future existence of the profession is totally dependent on the ability to transfer relationships -- to transfer client intimacy from one generation to the next. Transferring professional intimacy requires acceptance from three parties: an experienced professional who is willing to ""let go,"" a client who accepts the transfer, and a next generation planner who thinks and behaves as a professional and who has credibility with the client. Here are the author's personal observations as to what's necessary to get off the bench: 1. Exhibit professional decorum. 2. Exhibit professional judgment. 3. Exhibit genuine compassion. 4.

JFP,Absolute-Return-Oriented Strategies,"Absolute-return-oriented (ARO) strategies are designed to generate consistent, mid-single-digit returns in almost any market environment, with relatively low volatility and downside risk, and low correlation to traditional asset classes and risk factors. While adding ARO strategies to a portfolio may seem compelling in theory, the devil is in the details -- in evaluating the risk and return characteristics of each type of ARO strategy, understanding each manager's investment process, and evaluating their skill in executing their strategy. For those taking a closer look at ARO options, however, the following are research topics to address: 1. lack of track record, 2. complexity of ARO strategies, and 3. benchmarking. Gaining a sufficient level of confidence in the ability of an ARO manager to achieve his or her performance objectives is only part of the job. The question then becomes whether to add the fund to client portfolios, which would typically also entail selling an existing position.","Lowenstein, Alice, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Mar,2011

Although the majority of advisers do not use compliance software or electronic tools in their practice, of those who do, the most common solution is software provided by National Regulatory Services. The benefit advisers most frequently report receiving by using compliance software or other software for compliance purposes is also the benefit most important to advisers: having more peace of mind and less worry about things falling through the cracks.

Mark's life insurance is viewed as other investments he has, thus the logic of wishing to pursue selling some of his policies to diversify his perceived risk with AB Life. Mark noticed an ad from a local agent promising results, so he called the agent.

Many times clients want financial planners to be wiser than they are or even can be. This has caused the author to wonder what wisdom really is and do financial planners have it. He believes technology should always play a subordinate and supportive role to the financial planning process. Financial planners must constantly remind themselves that the planning process, and certainly life planning, is a human process -- technology should support it when appropriate but never dominate. Another interesting aspect of wisdom comes into play when financial planners have to restate an issue or problem for a client. Perhaps wisdom would suggest financial planners recognize that a clients interpretation of most things in life is dynamic and subject to radical change.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Mar,2011

The research conducted for this paper suggests that in order to achieve similar risk-adjusted performance as a static portfolio with the same equity allocation, one must be able to correctly select the outperforming asset class (either bond or equity) approximately 66% of the time, ignoring taxes. In order to achieve similar risk-adjusted performance as a static portfolio with the same equity allocation on an after-tax basis, one must be able to correctly select the outperforming asset class approximately 70% of the time. The likelihood of a tactical approach outperforming a static allocation decreases further when considering additional costs incurred by tactical investors, such as additional trading expenses.

He thinks that the cap-weighted indexes are a very important benchmark for measuring the market, an important part of their toolkit for investment strategies, and are beatable. He also said many investors like to forecast the future by extrapolating the past. The same logic for stocks is equally applicable as a gauge of forward-looking stock market returns. He added that there are always economic dislocations when savings rates change. But the notion that savings and investment are bad things is a warped interpretation of Keynesianism. A healthy economy involves considerable savings and considerable investment in the future.","Stolz, Richard F",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Feb,2011

Collaborating with an experienced attorney will help financial planners recognize and take advantage of opportunities to increase a survivor's wealth, even if it feels like it might be in the gray zone. In most states, a surviving spouse can elect against the will -- even if the will specifies a certain percentage of assets to go to the spouse, he or she can elect to take what the law allows, usually as much as 50%.","Lee, Shelley A",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Feb,2011

You've probably helped with many of your clients' life-transition points: mid-life crisis, empty nest, the shift into retirement. The reality is that 70% of widows switch financial advisers within three years after the husband's death. In other words, when you have grief education that equips you to say and do the right things instead of relying on commonly used phrases that offer minimal comfort, you position yourself to keep the clients you have and gain clients from advisers who don't know any better. Here are the ten principles for effective grief support. These include: 1. Realize it is not about you. 2. Every grief is unique. 3. Don't minimize or compare the loss. 4. There are no time limits. 5. No explanation of death is satisfactory to a grieving person. 6.

To do so requires financial planners to meet clients at the place of their past experiences, viewpoints, values, and, yes, biases. To expect them to see things as they do is to create a gap between them into which even the best financial planning science can fall, unimplemented. Take the case of Kerry and Lauren. Though 11 years apart in age, Kerry and Lauren met as single parents while regularly attending their sons' athletic events. They fell in love, began creating a wonderful life together, eventually married, and bought a new home, financed with a 30-year mortgage. For her part, it mattered deeply to Lauren that Kerry be able to retire at an age that would still allow them to pursue their bucket-list items, including extended periods of travel. Accelerating payments to eliminate the mortgage in 10 years was congruent with their values.","Guyton, Jonathan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Feb,2011

A simple, automatable algorithmic procedure is put forth for identifying bullish and bearish market trends with durations generally greater than primary-trend durations and less than those of secular trends. The algorithm uses the trailing 12-month average of the constant, 1901-dollar Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index to identify intermediate maxima and minima of the market. Statistical distributions of the major security-index total returns were derived separately for these intermediate-trend bullish and bearish periods spanning the past century and programmed into a Monte Carlo model to test the efficacy of slow-timing the market. The model subsequently statistically projects the behaviors of the portfolio-allocation strategies in accordance with the then-current market trend as each run is projected forward in time.

JFP,Tax-Efficient Stock Investing for Charitable Donors,"This paper presents a tax-efficient stock investing strategy whereby investors who regularly contribute to charity can earn after-tax returns that on average exceed their pre-tax returns. This is accomplished by realizing tax losses on stocks that have declined, while simultaneously using appreciated stocks in lieu of cash to make planned charitable donations. Expected returns can be increased further by using more volatile stocks to implement this strategy. Risk can be controlled by diversifying across multiple stocks. Diversification does not reduce the strategy's tax benefits because accrued gains on donated stocks are never realized and therefore are not offset against capital losses. The improvement in after-tax returns may be smaller if the investor has some long-term gains in the same year, if the stock incurs a loss exceeding $3,000, and/or if the stocks value grows to an amount larger than the planned charitable donation.","Whitworth, Jeff, PhD;McCormack, Joseph, PhD, CFA",1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Feb,2011
JFP,Pre-Mortem Planning: Creating the Family Care Culture,"The theme of this issue is post-mortem planning. The key to effective post-mortem planning is pre-mortem planning: engaging your client's family in deep, holistic, and substantive conversations about life transitions and challenges to be faced as time marches on, well before one is called to the great beyond. Consider: 34 million Americans provide care for family members or friends 50 years-of-age or older. Given the baby boom tsunami, the number of people needing care before they die will explode. It is not just elder care; 10.6 million Americans care for someone between ages 18 and 49. Of caregivers, 57% care for a parent or parent-in-law; 21% take care of a spouse; and 22% aid siblings, grandparents, other relatives, or friends. Deep, holistic pre- and post-mortem planning goes well beyond money, tax minimization, and the normal precepts of estate planning. It is about life transitions, peace and love in families, meaning and purpose, dignity, teamwork, legacy, and preservation of what matters.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CRC",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,11-Feb,2011
JFP,Protecting Your Child's Inheritance: The Beneficiary-Controlled Trust,"Post-mortem planning includes passing wealth to the descendants in a manner that protects the wealth for generations to come. In the litigious society, asset protection has emerged as one of the greatest concerns of clients. Parents are limited in terms of what they can do to protect their own property. They can establish limited liability companies and create asset protection trusts offshore or in states with favorable law, but these measures are usually not effective if judicial proceedings against the parents have already been initiated. The child is the beneficiary of his or her own separate trust. The trust assets are retitled directly from the parents' trust to the child's trust. If the child becomes a party to a lawsuit, such as a divorce or creditor action, the trust assets are protected because the child does not have the authority and cannot compel the distribution trustee to make distributions from the trust.","Gardner, Randy, JD, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Feb,2011

JFP,Inverse and Leveraged ETFs: Considering the Alternatives,"In June 2009, FINRA released Regulatory Notice 09-31 warning about misconceptions prevalent among investors of inverse and leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETF). For those unfamiliar with the products: inverse and leveraged ETFs (and similarly designed mutual funds) have been developed, in theory, to allow market participants to engage in short-term (usually on the order of one trading day) hedging or speculation across any array of market indexes and sectors. Despite the lack of perfect direct or inverse correlation and a slew of other issues, traditional clients without alternatives might still look to these ETFs to meet their investment goals. Fortunately, there exist better investment choices that allow for leverage and have their minimal or positive exposure to volatility: exchange-traded notes and futures and option contracts. A more widespread awareness of the varied and promising alternatives to leveraged ETFs should help investment professionals meet their clients' longer-term needs while avoiding many of the downsides of current ETF-based strategies.","Barnhorst, Bradley C, CFA;Cocozza, Christopher R, CPA, JD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jan,2011

Yes, Really","A Google search for marketing as a financial coach, personal financial coach, or personal finance education, without benefit of specific identifiable training, brings up numerous promoters (versus professionals) who are very effectively selling advice on personal finances because of their alleged personal successes in this arena. In the ensuing 40 years, people have attempted to create a profession through education standards, standards of care on delivered work, ethical standards of interaction with clients and community, standards demanding experience, and examination. Today, codes of conduct and ethics are strong, and with new pressure around fiduciary issues, people can expect them to strengthen further. The author sees a world where folks seek a partner in their financial lives through a professional financial planner who is their guide, not their guru, who delivers discipline over promises of great investment returns, and who is an advocate for them and coordinates that advocacy with the other professionals in their lives.","Hughes, Bonnie A, CFP, AIF",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,11-Jan,2011

Oct 9, 2010, FPA and Academy of Financial Services met in Denver, Colorado, and held a special panel session to address research concerns for practitioners and academia. They participated with a group of practitioner panelists who shared their wish list for future research. Hopefully in the new year, the authors and their academic associates will begin new research that provides some insights on these issues. Now that the authors have set their 2011 wish list, they're looking back on 2010. These articles provided interesting perspectives and addressed import topics in financial planning including annuities, portfolio insurance, investment horizons, managing inflation risk, active versus passive investing, and underlying statistical assumptions of economic and financial models.

JFP,Healthcare Planning and the New Reality,"In March 2010, Congress and the President enacted sweeping reforms affecting the terms and availability of health insurance for Americans. One of the changes made in the new healthcare legislation that has broad support is the extension of the age that children must attain before they are no longer permitted to be covered under their parents health insurance plan. Many individuals use flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, or medical savings accounts to fund healthcare expenses that are not covered by insurance. While uncertainty about the final direction of healthcare policy abounds, one thing is clear: planners and clients need to consider how these new provisions will affect them before making benefit decisions. In the meantime, keep a watchful eye on changes, which are likely to be enacted as Congress and the President endeavor to make the healthcare legislation more palatable to businesses, individuals, and, of course, politicians.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFP, CFA, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jan,2011
JFP,Avoiding the Pitfalls of Investment Management Outsourcing,"In a landscape characterized by increased regulatory scrutiny, an uncertain economic environment, and mole competition from newly independent rivals, more financial planners find their strength lies in building relationships with clients and devising an overall wealth-management strategy, rather than executing the nuts and bolts of that particular strategy. Adviser interest in outsourcing is apparent from the results of FPA's 2010 Trends in Investing survey, which found that while 57.5% of advisers surveyed don't outsource at all; the remainder outsource some or all investment management functions. Of those who do outsource all or some investment management, half began to do so in the past five years. For Cindy Richey, CFP, president of Prosperity Planning Inc, in Kansas City, MO, outsourcing only made sense once she found a solution that would simplify her investment management process and allow her to retain as much control as possible.","Buttell, Amy E",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jan,2011

Kurtz thinks the number one priority for all the members, everyone participating in FPA, to have a better understanding of who they are and how to best use their resources to influence the world around them. As they're seeing this more and more every year, the world needs people helping them with life and money, with financial planning. They're dealing with people and money, so the biggest challenge they face as financial planners is their own weaknesses.

JFP,An Analytic Approach to Selecting a Nonprofit for Donation,"Charitable giving continues to be an important aspect of the economic and social fabric of the US. The economic crisis has affected nonprofits in two important ways: First, the value of endowments of nonprofits has dropped significantly. Second, the difficult economic environment is affecting donors (individuals and foundations) negatively. In this study, the authors provide a framework for evaluating nonprofits based on a given set of financial and governance criteria. Their framework is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is a widely used tool for solving multi-attribute decision problems. The AHP methodology that the authors propose in this paper can be integrated into a database that contains information on various proxies for nonprofit performance measurement, and can serve as a decision aid for potential donors. They believe that a methodology that allows donors to identify the relative importance of performance criteria will stimulate further research on determining templates of proxies that are appropriate to measure the performance of different types of nonprofits.","Ramirez, Andrés, PhD;Saraoglu, Hakan, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jan,2011

JFP,"Life-Cycle Funds: International Diversification, Reverse Glide Paths, and Portfolio Risk","The recent turbulence of the domestic and international stock markets, most notably the significant decline in 2008 of major stock market indexes, has brought new interest to portfolio diversification and asset allocation strategies. Financial literacy has become more than a buzzword; it has become a credo for financial planners and journalists who seek to educate investors, especially after many investors experienced significant losses. In this paper, several hypothetical life-cycle funds (LCF) are analyzed in terms of volatility risk and probability of failure to teach target values. The methodology of Monte Carlo simulation is applied by using historical rates of return data reported by Ibbotson &amp; Associates for large-cap stocks, corporate bonds, and the MSCI-EAFE Index (international index). The increased awareness of LCFs has no doubt caused many individuals to address the issues of investing for retirement. Nevertheless, the asset allocation strategies of many LCFs may not provide the best portfolio risk protection when measured in terms of probability of reaching a specific portfolio target.","Schleef, Harold J, PhD;Eisinger, Robert M, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11-Jan,2011

The financial reform package mandates that the SEC study the fiduciary issue and report back in January. It also gives Shapiro and company the power to enact rules. Instead of stepping up to the plate and being regulated as advisers when brokers give advice, the brokerage lobby seems to be pushing the SEC to lean toward a rules-based system where if you disclose, you are okay.

The starting point for advice on this issue in the modern era is Bengen (1994), who famously motivated the 4% withdrawal rule using historical simulations. Numerous studies on sustainable withdrawal rates with various tweaks and modifications followed the early research. It is widely acknowledged and understood that the applicability of these withdrawal rate studies depends on the future behaving with the same patterns as the past. The author said their approach for obtaining a better idea about the implications of lower asset returns on sustainable withdrawal rates is to replicate the methodology of Bengen (2006a) using 109 years of financial market data for 17 developed market countries. With the SAFEMAX criterion, and from all international perspective, the 4% real withdrawal rule has simply not been safe.","Pfau, Wade D, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Dec,2010

Financial planning software mirrored this simplicity. However, financial planning has evolved to become more complex and holistic. Today's clients are more sophisticated and expect a greater level of interactivity and access to their financial planners. Clients expect a real-time, interactive experience that goes beyond the scope of mere investment management. The focus has moved from adviser-driven functionality to usable client information. In addition, many advisers have altered their presentation approaches to take advantage of this. More than three-fourth, of the 347 advisers surveyed who use financial planning software say they are satisfied with it. The most important benefits to these advisers are better client service/satisfaction, more effective communication with staff or clients, increased productivity, and the ability to serve a larger number of clients.

Some spend too much money, others are so frugal they cannot enjoy what they've earned, and still others don't want to talk about their relationship with money at all -- which makes your job as a financial planner that much more difficult. Over the years in the author's work as a family therapist, management consultant, and family wealth consultant, he has learned there are three primary reasons people struggle emotionally with money: culture, childhood conditioning, and psychological make-up. To be effective, financial planners need to understand how these three things unconsciously influence their clients, and how they can begin to counteract this unconscious conditioning. Financial planners are in an ideal position to help their clients discover their core values and purpose in life. Helping your clients break free from their unconscious patterns and money scripts so they can live a rich and fulfilling life may be the most significant gift you could give a fellow human being.","Pullen, Courtney",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Dec,2010

With this large a pool of potential clients, it is helpful to employ market segmentation to more effectively prospect for clients and hone skills for more effective client service. You should also investigate what industry resources and groups are active and how many professionals participate in each. If you know you want to focus on serving individuals in your local area, county or state income information call help you decide where to locate your office and/or which areas are good for prospecting or advertising.

One of the most serious challenges facing the financial planning industry today is how to help middle market boomers make informed retirement income decisions. Best practice guidelines are needed to help planners effectively help Americans retire with confidence. The Society of Actuaries has initiated research to help the financial services industry address this important need, and reports its Phase I and II findings in ""Segmenting the Middle Market: Retirement Risks and Solutions."" Analysis of the consumer segments revealed that at the midpoint for each, middle mass segments will depend primarily on Social Security, with additional lifetime income or earned income needed to either meet essential expenses or secure a moderate lifestyle. Making an informed decision about the timing of retirement and when to take Social Security benefits are critical decisions for the middle mass segments.","Seibert, Kevin S, CFP, CRC, CEBS;Meredith, Betty, CFA, CFP, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,10-Dec,2010

While studies are necessary to create a framework around decision making, it is experiences that are the substance. Today, planners live in models. They create models for withdrawal rates that are derived from models on expected inflation and investment returns. Clients have interpreted their market experiences and those experiences relate to their views of money. One of the cognitive biases from which planners suffer is group polarization. Groups tend to be more extreme than the average individuals in the group. It is useful to check outside the group to get feedback on your biases. Building relationships with non-industry people can broaden your horizons. You need to somehow distinguish between your truth and others' truths.","Levin, Ross, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Dec,2010

From a business perspective, they were an ideal fit for your firm's services. But you sensed some discord in the meeting. Communicating about personal financial matters should be fairly straightforward. Money is money: it's a quantifiable entity. Advisers and clients -- including partners in a couple -- often have different personalities, communications preferences, and learning preferences. Financial planners tend to classify people by their perceptions of their personality type: aggressive, submissive, intellectual, and so on.

Zandi thinks June 2009 is an appropriate point to mark the end of the Great Recession, which was 18 months long -- the longest recession in the post-World War II period. As long as you're not creating enough jobs to bring down unemployment in a substantive way, most Americans won't think that the recession has ended. If prices for an asset or asset class are rising strongly and have been rising consistently strongly for an extended period, that's certainly a necessary condition for some kind of a bubble and a future financial crisis. Good financial planning would say that you need to have a diversified asset base.","Nelson, Christina",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Dec,2010

When the IRS published Treas. Reg. §25.2512-6, there were only two types of insurance policies available for purchase: whole life and annual renewable term. Unfortunately, there is no guidance for gift tax purposes regarding which reserve is to be used when attempting to comply with the ITR requirement of Treas. Reg. §25.2512-6. Moreover, the life insurance industry is not in agreement about which reserve is to be used when attempting to comply with the Treasury regulations.

The largest number of students expect to hold a junior financial planner position upon graduation, a position which nearly 30% of firms said they employ. Another 13% expect a paraplanner position, 10% expect a retirement specialist position, and 10% expect to be the CEO/Owner/President. When it comes to the specific types of benefits offered, students are once again realistic in their expectations. Ninety-six percent of students anticipate that their insurance benefits would include healthcare; the same percentage of firms reported that they provide healthcare benefits to employees.

Of the 368 advisers who took part in FPA's 2010 Trends in Investing survey earlier this year, 60% indicated that over the past three months they had re-evaluated the asset allocation strategy they typically recommend and implement.

This article comes from research conducted from February 2008 to February 2009 and is the most recent Health and Retirement Study available. One of the biggest fears links to medical expenses. One in five individuals thinks that medical expenses will eat up all of their savings in the next five years. Eight in ten individuals think it's likely they will leave an inheritance worth $10,000 or more (including property and other valuables). Even within the context of the perceptions, only just over half of individuals expect to be working after the age of 62.

This framework, modern portfolio theory, is deeply embedded in the psyche of financial advisers and is applied to institutions as well as individuals, including individuals at or near retirement. Modern retirement theory (MRT) suggests that historical long-term averages may not apply in individual client scenarios and seeks to offer a sustainable benefit to individuals. It proposes a perspective on retirement planning that seeks to meet the individual client's retirement goals under any market condition or life event. The MRT standard is that individual retirement goals are absolute and therefore must result in a sustainable lifestyle throughout the retirement phase. To this end, MRT seeks to employ strategies that meet the client's stated objectives in any market climate, mitigate and transfer longevity risk and conditions within longevity risk, are tax efficient, and maximize assets by disbursing the client's retirement sheet assets into four broad categories.","Branning, Jason K, CFP;Grubbs, M Ray, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,7,1,7,1,1,1,4,1,5,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Dec,2010

According to Diliberto, a lot of people retire from things as opposed to to things. And he thinks it's extremely important that you retire to something as opposed to from something. He said planners can't approach this as if this is the first time you're ever having a conversation with this person. Planners need to understand their values and what's most important to clients in their lives so they have a pretty good idea about what really matters to them. Most of our clients who retire spend more money the first few years they're retired, not less. An assumption is you're going to spend less money when you retire. That's ridiculous.

JFP,5 Social Security Strategies for Couples,"One of the bigger decisions advisers face in developing retirement income strategies for their clients is when the clients should begin collecting Social Security benefits. Identifying optimal Social Security strategies can help clients maintain their quality of life and may result in a significant increase in benefits collected over their lifetimes. The first step in Determining the needs should be to figure out how much income clients will need in retirement and where this money will come from. Social Security usually provides at least 20% of pre-retirement income. When your clients want to retire and whether they want to keep working for income in some capacity during retirement are, of course, key questions. Clients can certainly begin drawing their Social Security benefits at age 62, but there is no requirement to do so and the benefits of waiting can be significant: approximately an 8% annual increase in benefits in real terms for every year they delay taking benefits from ages 62 to 70.","Fahlund, Christine S, PhD, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,6,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Dec,2010
JFP,Planners Find Success with Retirement Income Strategies,"As America ages, clients are demanding mote retirement income planning products and services, and planners are stepping up to meet that demand. Whether a planners primary strategy for providing retirement income involves a systematic withdrawal, time-based segmentation, essential versus discretionary income, Social Security and pensions, or a combination of strategies, planners are generally successful at executing retirement income planning. The increase in retirement income planning may simply be attributed to the fact that each year more baby boomers are closer to retirement. However, it may also be thanks to a shift in attitude. In 2010, planners report that 60% of their clients in or near retirement have made no significant changes to their retirement plans; this is the same finding as the 2009 survey. Planners who most commonly use a structured systematic withdrawal program were asked to indicate what they usually recommend as a sustainable withdrawal amount.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7,1,8,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Dec,2010

This paper outlines how to make sure investment horizons and opinions are consistently combined into an asset allocation using simple concepts from modem portfolio theory (MPT). The inputs into the asset allocation decision framework should be consistent with the clients willingness and ability to adjust his or her holdings. Another method of forecasting returns uses key historical economic and financial data to develop a small-scale macroeconomic model of future returns. In creating the framework for MPT, Markowitz did not suggest that returns are stable or independently and identically distributed across time. Rather, he acknowledged that the returns depend on the investment opportunities that are available at a point in time. Simply using MPT as a black-box, where you input historical averages, standard deviations, and correlations can give incoherent portfolios that are inconsistent with your outlook.","Jacobsen, Brian J, PhD, JD, CPA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Nov,2010

It is also a time when planners review events over the past 12 months and assess a client's progress to an existing financial plan. Planners implement a variety of techniques to gather data related to a client's cash flow. The level of detail collected largely depends on the comprehensive nature of the planning provided for a client. To help simplify personal income and expense tracking for clients, planners often recommend clients use desktop personal finance software. Instead of asking clients to manually track transactions or consistently download and review them in personal finance software, planners are turning to one of the most efficient tools available to automate personal finance management.","Winterberg, Bill, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8,1,9,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Nov,2010

When he says retirement accounts, he's talking about the 401(k) and the Roth. With the taxable account, the government is taxing the returns each year. So, you're only going to get some of the returns because the government is going to take some of the returns, and the Roth, of course, is growing tax-exempt. So, you get all the returns. You can make that portfolio last a few years longer by tax efficiently withdrawing the funds. Two key concepts again, the taxable accounts are taxed the most heavily and the retirement accounts taxed more favorably. The optimal assets to hold in the taxable account are assets on which you're going to allow the capital gains to grow unrealized and unharvested for long, long periods, ideally, until retirement.

JFP,"Tax Planning for Uncertain Times: Opportunities, Flexibility, and the Long View","With Congress struggling to come to grips with the politically thorny expiration of the so-called ""Bush tax cuts,"" practitioners are grappling with both short-term and longer-term tax planning opportunities for their clients. At the same time, planners are also encouraging clients to weigh important non-tax variables when plotting out wealth-building strategies. Whatever the outcome of the immediate ideological battle in Washington over federal marginal income tax rates and brackets, in 2013, higher income earners will face a pair of tax hikes that were enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 that may shape tax planning strategies for some clients. Another important tax planning consideration is the consensus opinion that preferential tax treatment for long-term capital gains will remain embedded in the Internal Revenue Code, even if the maximum rate rises significantly above today's 15% ceiling. Other tax-planning opportunities may be open to executives through maximizing certain employee benefits.","Stolz, Richard F",1,1,9,1,10,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Nov,2010

JFP,Life Transitions and Generational Timelines,"To focus on trends in financial planning, closely examine the confluence of demographics and economics. How you think about financial planning, how you frame your goals and objectives as an adviser, the tools that you embrace, and the conversations that you have with a client also are colored by generational timelines. While most of the practicing financial planning pioneers from the 1970s are Traditionalists, the bulk of today's experienced practitioners are boomers. The oldest boomers are approaching retirement, yet many do not have a succession plan. The Millennial Generation, also known as Generation Y, GenNext, the Google Generation, the Echo Boom, or even the Tech Generation, is the fastest-growing segment of workers today. This is the generation graduating from the universities teaching financial planning. For those planners who make it real, who communicate effectively with empathy across generations, the future is bright.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,10-Oct,2010
JFP,The Bonding Continuum in Financial Planner-Client Relationships,"All planner-client relationships reflect degrees of bonding and are potentially enduring and endearing. However, only a small subset achieves that status. Based on a survey of financial planners, only 13% meet the dual criteria of an especially strong bonding relationship: planners selected by a client to be contacted in cases of an emergency and planners selected to be the sole or co-executor of a client's will. This paper discusses implications of ties that bind, highlighting the risks and rewards of bonding relationships along the bonding continuum. Compared to weak bonders, strong bonders are more likely to have mediated conflicts or been involved in an intervention to get a client into therapy or drug treatment among other behaviors that create special ethical issues for bonders. Strong bonders are more likely to agree that coaching helps them do a better job as a financial planner and that coaching has improved the communication between clients and their family members.","Dubofsky, David, PhD, CFA;Sussman, Lyle, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Oct,2010
JFP,Weighing the Risks: Are Exchange-Traded Notes Right for Your Clients?,"This paper introduces readers to the exchange-traded note (ETN) structure. It provides a discussion of the differences between the ETN and exchange-traded fund (ETF) structures. The authors examine ETN credit risk in light of their underlying structure. They show that credit risk is a declining function of redemption frequency and that credit risk is a declining component of the total risk when redemption opportunities increase. If credit risk can be accurately estimated, investors can mitigate credit risk by purchasing ETNs with frequent redemption opportunities. However, given the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the demise of the Opta ETNs, investors should remain cautious, but realistic, when evaluating the credit risk of ETN issuers. ETNs offer a tax-preferred way to provide clients exposure to unique trading strategies, as long as the financial planner follows the guidelines, which involve ETNs with frequent redemption opportunities when issued by highly rated investment firms.","Smith, Jeffrey, PhD;Small, Kenneth, CFA, CFP",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Oct,2010
JFP,Helping Grandparents Model Good Money Behaviors,"The 2006 Ameriprise Financial study, ""A New Retirement Mindscape, identified what it called ""a startling new retirement planning need."" When it comes to making money decisions, children tend to be impulsive. In fact, it should be no surprise to all who are parents and grandparents that when it comes to making most decisions, younger children are naturally impulsive. Children simply aren't born with the capacity for self- observation and the ability to control their impulses and make decisions based on weighing alternatives. Thinking in terms of alternatives is called reflective thinking. Learning how to reflect before making decisions is an important life skill, and one that is the hallmark of people who make good choices in everything from careers to relationships and from purchases to investments.

Now, more than even the executive announcement or the company sale, prospects and current clients are tweeting, updating their status, joining online groups, and starting discussions on social media platforms.

They can be sued by a client for alleged malpractice, by their peers or their professional association for an ethical violation, by the Internal Revenue Service investigating a client or for the adviser's questionable tax advice, or by the SEC for securities violations. Many advisers believe their client files, notes, e-mails, and conversations are confidential and do not have to be turned over if the government or all opposing attorney subpoenas them, similar to the privilege that exists between a doctor and patient or attorney and client. Although financial advisers under the CFP Board Code of Ethics are required to keep client records confidential, financial advisers, even if they are not the target of the proceeding, must testify and/or produce records in response to subpoenas. Recent cases against accountants indicate that the traditional protections afforded professional documents are eroding.

JFP,"Empowering, Educating, and Engaging Women Clients","Today's women are making great strides among the ranks of professionals. Studies consistently highlight a gap between men and women in terms of their needs and involvement in the management of their personal finances and investment assets. Many financial advisers do not fully appreciate the differences between the financial styles of women and men, and fail to address women's needs or play to their strengths. Women have the capacity to effectively plan and manage their finances, but many lack the knowledge, skills, and experience to make decisions about their money and resources. They would like to find advisers who will educate and empower them, but too many distrust the financial services sector. As a profession, financial planners can build trust with a female clientele by a thoughtful and comprehensive review of all aspects of their practice, including their planning process, their subject matter expertise, and their relationship management.

If you really know your stuff, you can make sure your clients end up with more money than they ever had and more of it tax-free. You really have to look through a client's balance sheet and see what kinds of money they have. Basically all clients have four kinds of money: cash, capital gain property, tax-deferred 401(k)s and IRAs, and then the tax-free category, like Roth IRAs and life insurance. The goal, really, is to get the first three categories into the last one, to start moving everything to tax-free territory. There are actual taxes that could affect people's investments. Advisers should be looking at that.

JFP,"Back to School: Past, Present, and Future","By the end of 2008, financial planners whose clients had agreed to implement mid-course corrections in their withdrawal amounts would have been asked to take a small reduction in their pre-tax distributions, and the resulting withdrawal rate for 2009 would have been in line with policy-based safe withdrawal rate levels given an undervalued market environment. For retirees also receiving Social Security and/or pension income, this most likely generated an overall decrease in their after-tax income of less than 5%. Looking back, people can now say that clients ""unlucky"" enough to have retired in 2000 but who were fortunate to have advisers who implemented such distribution, rebalancing, and replenishment policies likely found themselves in pretty solid financial shape, all things considered, entering their second decade of retirement. For starters, take rebalancing.

The FPA Research Center has conducted a series of surveys over the last three years to find out how planners' recommendations are changing and why. In the current survey, members were asked whether they were planning to change or had recently changed the strategies they typically recommend/ implement for their clients. Nearly three-quarters said they were changing their strategies. Not only are planners re-evaluating the types of investments they recommend, but they are changing their recommendation strategies. In looking at the types of investments recommended, the biggest decrease has been in the number of advisers surveyed who said that they recommended individual stocks.

JFP,Finding the Planning in Financial Planning,"After four decades, the financial planning profession still lacks an overarching framework for organizing and testing the strategy-making (that is, ""planning"") activities of its practitioners. An integrating framework is proposed that consists of five modes of strategy-making: planner-driven, data-driven, policy-driven relationship-driven, and client-driven. Each of these five modes represents a different relative role for the planner and client in the planning process. The modes also fall along a parallel dimension of planning versus emergence. Client complexity is also analyzed as a predictor of client trust and commitment, and it is found that trust and commitment are inversely related to the complexity of a client's circumstances. Finally, a factor analysis of planner strategy-making activities shows that planners in independent firms tend to favor data- and policy-driven approaches and those practicing at large financial services firms tend to be more dominant in the planner-driven mode.","Yeske, David B, DBA, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Sep,2010

When asked what contributes most to job satisfaction the most popular responses are the work environment and their compensation. However, for those who are less satisfied, the lack of advancement opportunities is a key factor along with those two elements. In addition to self-identified drivers of satisfaction levels, the 2010 Financial Planning Salary Survey also collected information on job and practice characteristics to confirm whether there is a correlation between the drivers individuals perceive as contributing most to their satisfaction and actual satisfaction, and identify other drivers of satisfaction that the individual may not actively recognize.

In his fiscal year 2011 budget, President Barack Obama proposed changes to the rules governing GRATs, and they were included in the Small Business and Infrastructure Jobs Act of 2010 passed by the US House of Representatives March 25.

That made him start thinking more generally about other cases in life where people make the wrong decisions systematically, even though they believe they are making the right decision. Every time you learn a skill involving human persuasion, you can use it for good or for bad. In financial planning, the current value that planners are giving is so miniscule compared to what they could be doing that Ariely thinks that there is a lot of room for using behavioral economics for everyone's benefit.

This article analyzes some of the data from the 2008 Consumer Expenditure Survey to help planners better identify and segment the consumer market for marketing purposes. If the good news is that spending is increasingly modestly, the bad news is that incomes are barely increasing at all. The 1.7% increase in household expenditures from 2007-2008 more than doubled the percentage of income gains.

JFP,Roth Accounts: Seeing the Forest for the Trees,"There are four distinct types of scenarios in which a decision can be required regarding the possible use of a Roth account: 1. Roth conversion tax cost funded through taxable assets, 2. equal contributions to Roth and traditional IRAs, 3. Roth conversion funded through qualified account proceeds, and 4. Roth contributions vs. grossed-up traditional contribution. This article provides an analysis framework for advisers to take several key factors into account and provide investors with a robust and consistent way of making decisions involving conversions and contributions to Roth accounts. Most investors consider qualified accounts to be assets. But a qualified account balance includes both assets and liabilities. The balance includes a deferred liability attributable to the income tax the investor would owe if he withdrew the entire account balance. The deferred liability is essentially a debt, and Roth conversion may be seen as an opportunity to prepay it.","Kenigsberg, Matthew B, CFA",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Sep,2010

Create Your Own Pension Plan for a Secure Financial Future, 2009, FT Press. The need for financial planning for individuals has never been greater as the trend away from defined benefit plans toward defined contribution plans continues. In the ""What Should Your Asset Allocation Be When You Retire?"" study, John Okunev tests tactical asset allocation techniques against a well known rule of thumb presented by Bengen (1994) and Cooley.

That practice is about to change with the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008's cost-basis reporting provisions. The new rules phase in from Jan 1, 2011, through Jan 1, 2013, depending on the security's type. The new regulations cover several topics, including: 1. Default cost-basis assumptions and lot specification. 2. Brokers must provide cost-basis information for covered securities when transferring assets. 3. Gifted and inherited shares transferred between accounts must be identified and gain/loss must be accounted for. 4. Brokers must account for wash sales within single accounts.

A few thought it was horrible that CFP Board, Financial Planning Association, and National Association of Personal Financial Advisors would ever speak to each other, let alone agree with each other about anything. Financial planning, financial planners, and planning clients need advocacy.

In this article the author suggests that research findings in the field of cognitive neurosciences can inform investors about the flaws and errors of one's financial memory and lead to new insights about how these flaws of memory can be overcome in everyday investment decisions. In the next section he will demonstrate how these memory flaws act in common financial decision-making processes and may lead to a distorted view of past decisions.

JFP,How to Build a Niche Practice,"In a profession that finds itself between a rock and a hard place -- increasing client expectations and decreasing client assets -- financial planners are taking a second look at niche practices as a potential solution to their economic woes. This concept is not a new one. In 2005, Mark Tibergien and Rebecca Pomering identified eight different strategies a planning practice could use to grow and to differentiate itself from the competition. Their work, conducted in conjunction with Moss Adams LLP, found most advisory firms to be generalists. Another differentiator, the distinct but similar ""technical specialty firm"" accounted for another 11% of strategies deployed. These firms focus on an internal specialty such as executive stock options or charitable gift planning. This article will consider both kinds of firms with an emphasis on the niche market firms. All the advisers interviewed by the Journal agreed that serving niche clients does not entail getting rid of your existing clients.","Grote, Jim, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Aug,2010

JFP,Overcoming Hiring Hurdles,"Securing a first job is certainly a chore no matter what industry is chosen, but with financial planning's infancy, lack of a professional career track, and even a dearth of internal career tracks, the challenge for new planners is monumental. Recent research released by FPA states that 84% of firm owners rely on word of mouth/networking to recruit new hires. Here are some additional strategies firms may want to consider in recruiting new planners: 1. Participate in Career Day programs. 2. Attend career fairs on college campuses. 3. Participate in internship and/or mentoring programs. 4. Use industry-specific job sites such as financialplannerjobs.com, and association sites such as FPA and NAPFA. 5. Post an ad in a newspaper or industry publication. 6. Work with a coach, practice management consultant, or recruiter. 7. Utilize non-industry-specific online job boards such as monster.com and careerbuilder.com.

JFP,Managing Retirement Income for the Mid-Market,"Planners need to know how to guide retirees and near retirees through a maze of sometimes contradictory goals and trade-offs while managing retirement resources to last over a period of uncertain length and expense. They need to be able to tailor their advice to the unique circumstances of individuals who are most at risk of running out of money during retirement. Retirement income planning builds on what you already know about accumulating assets for retirement and applies those concepts in a new way. The following six steps provide a systematic method of producing a tailored plan to manage retirement income and risks. They are also applicable when working with higher-net-worth clients who want to spend more than they should: 1. Estimate duration of retirement assets. 2. Identify and manage retirement risks. 3. Identify distribution, tax, and estate issues and opportunities. 5. Identify options for addressing gaps. 5. Convert resources into income. 6.

JFP,Creating Grantor Trusts,"Several estate planning techniques rely on the use of grantor trusts. The grantor trust rules are found in IRC §§ 671-677 and are a congressional response to a long history of taxpayer attempts to split taxable income with or to shift taxable income to trusts while retaining either the right to the income or the power to control beneficial enjoyment. The grantor trust rules apply if certain powers are retained by the grantor or held by the grantor's spouse and third parties. One of the most difficult issues in many estate plans is selecting the specific mechanism that will result in an irrevocable trust being classified as a grantor trust for income tax purposes without creating adverse estate tax consequences. With various options available, you should almost always be able to find a technique that creates grantor trust status without adverse estate tax consequences.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Aug,2010

Financial advisers therefore put a great deal of time and energy into ensuring their client communication practices are top-notch. When death touches a client, these careful schemas of communication no longer apply, and many advisers enter uncharted territory as they attempt to sincerely convey concern and sympathy in the context of a professional relationship. The author offers the following guidelines, formed through her education in bereavement, facilitation of a support group for over 20 years, personal experience of being widowed, and the collective wisdom of hundreds of grieving people: 1. Attend the services. 2. Rethink sending flowers to the funeral home. 3. Make a donation in the name of the deceased. 4. Send your first card a few days after the services. 5.

According to Hurley, he believes states should eliminate income tax deductions for 529 plans. The tax advantages were compelling: the need was out there for a way for families to try to save money for college and not have to pay income taxes on the earnings that should actually be going to pay tuition bills. Hurley thinks the future is fairly bleak simply because prepaid tuition plans are facing conditions of high tuition increases and inadequate investment returns, which are causing them to suffer severe financial distress. This is occurring to such an extent that many prepaid plans have been shut down to new enrollment simply because they cannot afford to bring more families into those plans. Still, prepaid plans aren't necessarily dead.","Buttell, Amy E",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Aug,2010

JFP,Return Measures and Dollar Cost Averaging,"Financial planners are routinely asked to make future value of annuity calculations regarding an investor's target wealth based on assumptions about the annual rate of return and an annual contribution amount. Planners, however, need to carefully examine the assumptions behind their computations. The importance of return sequence for dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investors is supported in the literature. This paper proceeds as follows: First the authors examine realized returns from the period 1990-2009 from the perspective of both lump sum investors and investors who are making annual contributions to illustrate the difference in outcomes for the realized annual returns on contributions depending on the order of returns. Then perform Monte Carlo simulations using parameter estimates from 1990-2009 to gauge the probability for an outcome of more than a 300 basis point difference between the realized geometric mean and the realized effective annual return on contributions. Finally, they highlight some key findings and the implications for individual investors and their advisers.","Chittenden, William T, PhD;Moon, Kenneth P, PhD;Toles, J Holland, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Aug,2010

His firm had few if any, retired clients. He was building the firm with folks who were age 40, plus or minus 15 years. This article presents five of his beliefs about retirement planning: 1. In the real world, there's no such thing as a straight line or a smooth curve. 2. There's no such thing as a safe investment. 3. Human beings have little capacity to predict their spending patterns five years from now, let alone 40 years from now. 4. Human beings aren't wired to conceptualize large sums of capital. 5. The answer doesn't (and will never) rely on one simple solution or product.

JFP,The Psychology of Retirement Planning,"While there has been a recent awakening to the psychological dimensions of money and investing -- often referred to as behavioral finance or behavioral economics -- there has been precious little work that connects these dimensions specifically to retirement planning. Now, in the wake of the worst financial downturn since the Great Depression, millions of boomers are on the threshold of their golden years and are deeply in need of revisiting their notion of retirement. As a result, financial planners are increasingly called upon to act as counselors -- or even part-time psychologists. The good news is you need not possess an in-depth knowledge of investor psychology to understand how your clients think about money. The most important thing is to be cognizant of the emotions that play into their financial decisions and use these considerations to guide the financial planning process. Taking all factors into account -- in other words, taking a truly holistic approach to financial planning -- is essential to helping your clients achieve their retirement goals.","Salsbury, Gregory, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Jul,2010

JFP,Opportunities in Retirement Plans for Small-Business Owners,"Small-business owners typically are too busy building their enterprises or, in today's challenging environment, keeping them afloat, to stay abreast of opportunities in retirement plan design and investments. Indeed, many are often unaware of their basic legal obligations as retirement plan sponsors and de facto fiduciaries, such as having a formal investment policy in writing. While many planners have been chipping away for years at accumulating small-business retirement plan assets to manage, the opportunities to make headway today may be better than in the recent past. For one, business owners who have long banked on selling their businesses to generate retirement capital are beginning to on the scheduled jump in individual federal income and capital gains tax rates next year resulting from the end of the Bush tax cuts. Defined benefit (DB) plans are designed and funded to provide a retirement annuity that is determined by a formula encompassing the future retiree's salary and age.","Stolz, Richard F",0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Jul,2010

This paper deduces the cost at which such insurance -- put options -- is viable, and when it is likely to backfire on the client and planner. Of the various put options available to protect against a wide market decline, those on CBOE exchange-traded funds covering a broad number of stocks are the most appropriate hedging tool. Previous studies have looked at a strategy of continuously buying puts to protect a portfolio. While this is a fail-safe method, the costs of the hedging would so eat into returns as to make the strategy a less-than-optimum deployment of funds. A cost limit must be involved. For the S&amp;P 500, the best strategy was to select the put option with the lowest annualized cost but with a limit of 4%.","Burke, John B, CFP;Xu, Wei",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Jul,2010
JFP,Treasury Bills and Inflation,"The objective of this paper is to examine the historical performance of Treasury bills relative to bonds and stocks under different inflationary conditions. Over the period studied, Treasury bill yields were positively correlated with inflation and on average provided nominal returns before taxes above the inflation rate. However, on an estimated after-tax basis, the real returns became negative and thus did not preserve an investor's capital. Furthermore, the long-term average real return on Treasury bills was lower than the average real return on bonds and stocks, especially on an estimated after-tax basis. Thus, stocks and bonds provided better long-run protection against inflation. However, Treasury bills performed better than bonds and stocks in years when inflation was very high. Historical experience suggests that over the long run Treasury bills are not a good hedge against inflation. However, because stocks and bonds are more adversely affected by high inflation levels and/or large increases in inflation, Treasury bills could temporarily serve as a refuge.","Trevino, Ruben C, PhD;Yates, Barbara M, PhD",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Jul,2010

In this column the authors describe some key findings from behavioral finance that pertain to performance evaluation and provide suggestions for how advisers incorporate these findings into their practice. Advisers have a difficult job because their performance is judged after the fact and post evaluations are often clouded by hindsight bias. Here are three recommendations: 1.

JFP,Roth IRA Conversions: Estate and Tax Planning Information,"This article presents an overview of the features of the Roth IRA, including exploring guidelines for determining whether conversion from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs makes the most sense. One guideline suggests that the longer the interval before eventual distribution, the greater the expected benefit of conversion from traditional to Roth IRAs. Another guideline suggests that increased return assumptions tend to favor conversion to Roth IRAs. The article then looks to the conversion opportunity specific to 2010, and explores recharacterization and re-conversion, as well as partial recharacterizations. In the case of full re-conversions of the Roth IRA balance in an account, no gain/loss calculation is needed; however, partial re-conversions must take into account the net income attributable, the gain or loss experienced while it was in the Roth IRA. Because Roth IRA owners and surviving spouses are not required to take required minimum distributions, Roth conversion can present a unique estate planning opportunity.","Gordon, David J, CFP, CIMA",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Jul,2010

Clearly, traditional banks and mortgage lenders are under pressure from increasing capital requirements, troubled loan portfolios, TARP restrictions, and a general risk-averse attitude, making it extremely difficult for them to extend credit, even to highly qualified borrowers. This gap between the supply of mortgage loans and demand creates an excellent opportunity for an alternative solution to traditional lending. Known as ""private mortgage lending,"" this category of mortgage financing offers high returns to investors who make loans directly to borrowers secured by individual or pooled deeds of trust. Once a loan is funded, a private mortgage lender services the loan and manages the borrower relationship and payment schedule. From a financial planning point of view, pooled trust deed investments in particular provide an alternative, fixed income solution to enhance returns and help diversify fixed income portfolios.","Welsh, Timothy D, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Jun,2010

The worst shortcoming of the current budget process is that the US doesn't have budget controls in place that provide fiscal discipline to make sure that the country is on a prudent and sustainable path. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the new healthcare reform legislation standing alone will end up somewhat decreasing the country's deficits over the next 10 years and even more so over the following 10 years. However, that's based upon a number of assumptions, which may or may not prove to be valid.

The decision to claim reduced Social Security retirement benefits before full retirement age (FRA) is not irrevocable. Prior research into the structure of Social Security retirement benefits has identified optimal claiming ages for married couples with dissimilar ages and differing Primary Insurance Amounts (PIA). A benefit less than or greater than the PIA is paid if claimed at less than or greater than at full retirement age (FRA). The benefit is reduced by 6.67% per year for each of the first three years prior to FRA, and reduced another 5% for each additional year. Because reductions or increases to retirement benefits are actuarially equivalent for the person with average life expectancy, an unmarried retiree should be indifferent to when he or she makes a claim.

A withdrawal policy statement specifies the goals, policies, and parameters that the client and adviser agree to adopt to guide future decision-making regarding the use of the client's financial capital to help fund their lifestyle during their retirement years. The establishment of a withdrawal policy statement begins with a conversation to refocus your client's values, goals, fears, and expectations about his or her upcoming retirement.

The stock market decline in 2008 left many retirees, and their advisers, questioning the long-term sustainability of their distribution portfolio. Unlike past research, which has suggested sequence risk only exists for a certain period, the authors contend that a ""spectrum"" of exposure to sequence risk exists, and that sequence risk is always present, regardless of how long distributions have been occurring. While it is commonly assumed that sequence risk ""goes away,"" sequence risk is actually something that is always present. Although the discussion about sequence risk has been in terms of withdrawal rate research, the purpose of this paper is to shift more attention to the use of probability of failure as a dynamic tool to continually evaluate ongoing exposure to adverse market sequences (risk) as a retiree ages through his or her distribution years.","Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP;Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,10-Jun,2010

The main purpose of PPACA is to mandate universal health coverage by requiring individuals, not businesses, to obtain health-care coverage or pay penalties. Exemptions from the penalty are granted for financial hardship, religious objections, American Indians, those without coverage for fewer than three months, aliens not lawfully present in the US, incarcerated individuals, those for whom the lowest cost plan option exceeds 8% of household income, those with incomes below the tax filing threshold, and those residing outside of the US.

If compliance is part of the legal department, conflict can arise from attorneys' natural interest in protecting the firm; compliance, on the other hand, may be focused on a goal of helping advisers improve their practices and procedures.

One way that markets display their expectations of inflation is through interest rates -- particularly through the difference in the yields of Treasury bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). TIPS, however, are structured to increase their principal amount in direct proportion to changes in the Consumer Price Index. Gold has historically been one of the most popular choices for investors seeking to hedge against inflation, and with the increasing availability of exchange-traded funds (ETF), gaining access to the gold market may be easier.

Because investors are presumed to be rational and have perfect economic foresight, and because there is no change believed to occur in the economic system, investors can safely assume that past returns will be repeated in the future. In this world, asset class returns, volatility, and the correlation of returns for all asset classes can be modeled using traditional techniques, and the investment adviser's role is simply to provide a fixed diversified portfolio that lies somewhere along the single fixed efficient frontier.","Kitces, Michael E, CFP, CLU, ChFC;Solow, Kenneth R, CFP, CLU, ChFC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Jun,2010

There is more volatility for portfolios high on the frontier and less volatility for portfolios low on the frontier. On average, you should spend a little less than what you make. So, you know, just because a portfolio did poorly in 2008, as long as that was in line with its estimated volatility, then, that was perfectly acceptable performance for that portfolio.

This paper defines safe profiles in which real income decreases with age, called aggressive profiles. Two types of aggressive profiles are defined, smooth and step. In smooth profiles, real retirement income decreases a constant amount each year. Step profiles maintain a constant real income level for five-year periods before decreasing. Monte Carlo simulations are used to test 30-year profiles and identify those that have 99%, 95%, and 90% success rates. Three common-sense rules based on previous research are used to adjust a retiree's annual real income each year in retirement in response to economic conditions.

JFP,Diversification Effect: Isolating the Effect of Correlation on Portfolio Risk,"Diversification effect (DE) is a reduction in portfolio risk created by imperfect correlations between asset return pairs. DE is important because correlations are independent of rate of return. Thus, portfolio risk can be reduced without compromising rate of return. Correlation coefficients are frequently used to measure DE in practical applications of portfolio management. All asset return pairs possess correlation, allocation, and risk properties. Therefore, correlation, as a measure of DE, can be confounded by allocation and risk. This article proposes a DE metric that isolates the effect of correlation coefficients on portfolio risk by controlling the effects of allocation and the risk imposed by individual asset returns. By precisely measuring DE, financial planners can manage it in the context of other important portfolio properties and investors' multiple competing objectives. The content of this article is technically complex and intended only for use by experienced financial planners who commit significant resources to constructing and maintaining investment portfolios.","Hight, Gregory N",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-May,2010

JFP,Games Rich People Play,"The unthinkable has happened, Congress let the temporary estate tax repeal survive to its sunset year. When the Economic Growth and Tax Relief and Reconciliation Act of 2001 was passed, leading to a one-year repeal of the estate tax in 2010 followed by a rebirth of the tax in its full former glory in 2011, nobody believed that there really would be a repeal of the tax in 2010. The consensus was that the repeal and sunset were budget gimmicks and that Congress would take action to avoid this result before the end of 2009. If Congress does repeal the estate tax outright, it is true that life insurance will no longer be needed to fund the payment of estate taxes. The use of life insurance in transfer planning remains alive and well even in an estate tax repeal environment.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA",0,0,8,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,10-May,2010

JFP,The Varying Cost of Options and Implications for Choosing the Right Strategy,"Put buying reduces risk, but is expensive and dramatically depresses returns. It is only worthwhile if timed for extreme downturns, or when combined with call selling into collars. Collars offer the best of both worlds: a significant risk reduction without a significant return erosion. Call selling alone leads to superior terminal wealth, but has no positive effect on risk. Thus, in the buy-vs.-sell debate, the real questions are not whether to, but what to buy or sell, when, and why (from the retirement saver's perspective). The authors study the cost of using index options to protect equity portfolios. To estimate the cost, they combine the VIX index (which determines the at-the-money implied volatility) with the volatility skew and bid-ask spreads (because protective strategies involve buying and selling various strike levels). Because the cost of options varies dramatically over time and is weakly (negatively) correlated with the market, investors have to be wise in how they overlay option protection on investment portfolios.","Dubil, Robert, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-May,2010

Popular Web sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter provide compelling and previously unimaginable ways to communicate with family, friends, allied professionals, clients, and prospects. But with this rapidly growing medium comes significant uncertainty about how planners can leverage social media to meet business objectives and do so without violating regulatory or compliance requirements.

He's heard a lot of excuses for not improving disclosure, imposing a fiduciary duty, and regulating financial planners. The two most common excuses he has heard for not wanting better disclosure of compensation are that exact amounts cannot be determined ahead of time and full disclosure will undermine client trust. If financial planning is to become a true profession, it must push for the establishment of distinct regulation with fiduciary duties at its core. With the CFP marks, the building blocks already exist. One has to qualify and stay qualified to use the marks.

This paper examines these rules and their implications for benefit claiming strategies, complementing recent studies on Social Security claiming decisions. Using present value analysis, the researchers examine the effects of claiming benefits at different ages. Results vary depending on whether a widow is only eligible for a survivor benefit from Social Security or eligible for a survivor benefit and a retirement benefit. When a widow is only eligible for a survivor benefit based on her deceased husband's work record, the researchers find the present value of lifetime benefits is only modestly affected by the age at which benefits are claimed. In dually eligible cases, benefit claiming strategies can be important. Which benefit should be claimed first in dually eligible cases depends on the ratio of the two basic benefit amounts.","Shuart, Amy N;Weaver, David A, PhD;Whitman, Kevin",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Apr,2010

The author suspects that many of the planners are not very forgiving of themselves. Maybe they expanded too quickly because they assumed growth was inevitable. Maybe they were forced to lay off some terrific employees because profits evaporated. Maybe they lost some long-term clients because they felt betrayed.

This column raises several issues related to the trustee's investment function that are likely to be near to the heart of the financial adviser and that should be raised with the client and his or her attorney when an irrevocable trust is being drafted. Unless otherwise restricted in the trust instrument, a trustee has broad investment discretion under the estate and trust laws of most states, especially those that have adopted the Uniform Prudent Investor Act. Without further planning, the trustee will be vested with sole investment discretion. While this is undoubtedly appropriate in many instances, there are other instances in which the settler may not be satisfied with this result or the beneficiaries might not be best served by this result. Consideration should be given to the use of a trust protector with authority to change the manner in which investment discretion is exercised.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Apr,2010

He said that it's when planners are being proactive, sending clients their ideas and encouragement, and anticipating their needs, that make planners most valuable to their clients. Lieber would encourage planners to reach out to people who write about personal finance via e-mail, without a PR person in between. Find 5 or 10 journalists, whether they are local or national, who think the way you do and are doing work that you respect.","Stolz, Richard F",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Apr,2010
JFP,Betting the Farm: Estate Planning for Middle-Income Clients,"When the average person, perhaps even some planners, thinks of the estate tax, they probably think of the scenario of Karen Davidson and the Detroit Pistons of the NBA. Many in the estate planning world are dismayed that Congress -- healthcare and other distractions notwithstanding -- let the clock wind down on 2009 without enacting some legislation to address the expiring estate tax. A failure to act this year means the estate tax will return in 2011 to levels seen early in the decade -- an exemption of only $1 million, as opposed to the current $3.5 million, with the remainder being taxed at 55%. The classic definition of estate planning includes three goals outside addressing the estate tax: plan for incapacity, distribute your assets when and to whom, and provide for minor children or those with special needs.

JFP,Money on Your Mind: The Brain's Role in Financial Decision-Making,"The sophistication of modern civilization masks the fact that the brains have evolved little since the Stone Age. The neural programming of human beings was optimized for physical survival, not contemporary challenges such as financial decision-making. The human brain has separate, dedicated centers for coping with situations that present imminent danger or attractive rewards. When triggered by highly stimulating personal or financial events, these centers can cause the brain to react reflexively, dampening the ability to think analytically. Technology gives people ready access to their credit, savings, and investment accounts. Unfortunately, this access makes it easier for people to act upon impulsive financial decisions. This paper examines a case study to demonstrate how perceived financial dangers or rewards can unconsciously trigger emotions that override their rational decision-making. Financial planners also can help their clients develop new methods to read to financial situations in a more analytical manner that is consistent with the clients primary values.","Lennick, Doug, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Apr,2010

JFP,Guiding Clients Through the Transition to Medicare,"Once a fairly straightforward process, transitioning clients to Medicare from employer-based or individual insurance coverage has become a process fraught with costly pitfalls, where sheer ignorance or a simple mistake can carry financial and medical consequences throughout the retirement years. Depending on the state of your clients' health and what happens with healthcare reform and healthcare inflation, their overall tab in retirement for out-of-pocket expenses, including Medicare premiums, deductibles, and co-pays on prescriptions, as well as costs that aren't covered by Medicare, is likely to be a minimum of $100,000 and could easily hit $300,000. This excludes costs and premiums associated with long-term care.

Large estates with difficult to market assets face a potential estate tax liquidity problem. Life insurance is ideal for this situation. A few years ago, many life insurance companies developed and began selling universal life policies with no-lapse secondary guarantees based on paying specified premiums. Static pricing is in stark contrast to market pricing. A market priced policy's performance (and premiums) will depend on future fixed-income yields and mortality experience. Static-priced policies have low to no cash values, whereas market-priced policies have robust cash values. Static-priced policies have little to zero cash values. In contrast, market-priced policies have robust cash values. There is a tremendous liquidity difference between the Acme Life static-priced and Premier Life market-priced options. This report demonstrates that there aren't right and wrong ways to buy life insurance. Each option has potential advantages and disadvantages.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Mar,2010
JFP,"The Rules of Engagement, Part 2","This article focuses on the additional obligations on CFP certificants who clearly practice financial planning in their engagements, or those deemed to be doing so. In determining whether the certificant is providing financial planning or material elements of financial planning, factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: 1. the client's understanding and intent in engaging the certificant, 2. the degree to which multiple financial planning subject areas are involved, 3. the comprehensiveness of data gathering, and 4. the breadth and depth of recommendations. Financial planning may occur even if the material elements are not provided to a client simultaneously, are delivered over a period of time, or are delivered as distinct subject areas. It is not necessary to provide a written financial plan to engage in financial planning. One of the ideas circulating in Washington, DC, today is that anyone who gives financial advice to the public will be held to a fiduciary standard.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Mar,2010
JFP,Asset Allocation for Retirement: Simple Heuristics and Target-Date Funds,"The authors examine common asset allocation strategies for retirement investing, considering both static and dynamic approaches, as well as those allocation policies used by leading target-date fund providers. They studied the average performance of each strategy over historical rolling periods, using actual annual returns starting in 1926. Then they applied the simulation method to review potential future results, as well as to provide additional insight into the structure and characteristics of each approach. They find that, over time, certain static approaches are essentially equivalent to dynamic strategies that reduce equity exposure through time. They suggest that financial planners consider a 100% equity allocation for their clients until approximately 10 years prior to a client's retirement, at which point a more conservative allocation should be employed. When planning for their clients' retirements, financial planners must pay particular attention to determining target asset allocations and especially to the split between overall equity and debt.","Dolvin, Steven D, PhD, CFA;Templeton, William K, PhD;Rieber, William J, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Mar,2010
JFP,Unsafe at Any Speed? The Designed-In Risks of Target-Date Glide Paths,"Given the poor investment performance that so many defined contribution plan participants experienced by investing in target-date funds (TDF) in 2008 and early 2009, it is not surprising that the US Department of Labor is reviewing their suitability as a ""safe harbor"" qualified default investment alternative. These funds in marketed as simple solutions for plan participants who find it too difficult, unpleasant, or time-consuming to choose among investment alternatives. Lawmakers, regulators, and plan sponsors have expressed concern with TDF safety. The level of investment risk in these funds is primarily a function of their asset allocation glide paths. The term ""glide path"" refers to the schedule for changing the proportion of assets invested in stocks, bonds, or cash over time. Another set of issues has to do with risk measurement. Currently, there is no generally accepted standard for measuring target-date fund risk. This has led to much uncertainty over just how risky they are.","Bodie, Zvi, PhD;Fullmer, Richard K, CFA;Treussard, Jonathan, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Mar,2010
JFP,CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS: What Do Financial Planning Services Consumers Look Like Now?,"One result of the economic downturn is that many financial planners are looking for ways to optimize their client base, either by adding new clients or marketing additional services to their existing ones. FPA recently commissioned a survey of consumers and potential consumers of financial planning services. As expected, the percentage of those who receive financial planning services increases with the respondent's age. Of all respondents age 65 or older, 32.4% receive services, compared to only 6.2% of the 18-24-year-olds surveyed. Predictably, respondents with higher annual incomes were more likely to already be working with a financial planner. Twenty-eight percent of people in the $100,001-$150,000 bracket work with a financial planner, as do 29% of those in the $150,001-$200,000 bracket and 60.9% in the $200,001-and-up bracket.

As she began working with special-needs families, she found that most of them had not done planning, or had done improper estate planning and didn't understand why they were doing it. Confusion is the biggest challenge families and their advisers face in special-needs planning -- and that they don't know what they don't know. Just getting proper advice is another challenge. They formed Protected Tomorrows in 2003. What they do is comprehensive planning or holistic planning, focusing on the person with special needs and fitting that into the family's financial plan. They found that there were so many special-needs families that they couldn't serve them all. So they started their advocacy program called Protected Tomorrows Advocates. Unless a planner is really driven, it's a tough step to take -- like any adviser who wants to add a social work component to their practice.","Most, Bruce",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Mar,2010

This article reveals findings from FPA's 2009 Advisers' Attitudes and Perceptions About the Retirement Income Distribution Market study, conducted by The Diversified Services Group and sponsored by Nationwide Financial Institute of Retirement Income. The methods of healthcare management used by the adviser have no affect on the likelihood of clients having to delay their retirement, become re-employed, or make a significant lifestyle adjustment related to economic conditions. Advisers who do employ any of the methods of healthcare management specified in the study are just as likely to have clients experience those situations as advisers who do not employ that same method.

JFP,Staying Relevant,"One of the most significant changes in the financial planning profession over the last 30 years is the commoditization of so much of it. Commoditization takes place when there is a dilution of the differentiation and competitive advantages in favor of a mass market, with pricing determining behavior. In the early days of financial planning, a significant part of the value was related to the ability to crunch numbers and do projections. The more planners attempt to mechanize and institutionalize the qualitative part of a client relationship, the less relevant their services will become. Technological advances, because of their potential for dehumanization, must always be subordinate to a successful personalized client relationship, especially relating to qualitative issues. So while it is critical to differentiate yourself based on non-quantitative issues, the focus on ""wisdom and experience"" type issues magnifies the potential of obtaining new clients.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Mar,2010

Two factors should affect individuals' decisions about when to begin Social Security benefits. For single taxpayers with average life expectancies who will not be subject to an earnings test, present value of benefits is approximately the same no matter when benefits begin. Therefore, based on present value criterion, singles with short life expectancies should begin benefits early and those with longer life expectancies should delay. Finally this study discusses the do-over option, whereby someone can repay prior benefits and start benefits anew. Singles can start benefits at age 62 regardless of their health and reassess their health at age 70. Couples can also benefit from the do-over but there is a risk of the higher-earning partner starting benefits earlier with the plan to invest the Social Security benefits, keep the interest and repay them at a later date.","Meyer, William;Reichenstein, William, PhD, CFA",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Mar,2010

In December the authors discussed some insights of behavioral finance that pertain to establishing the adviser-client relationship and profiling the client. They describe some key findings from behavioral finance that pertain to making recommendations to clients and make suggestions for advisers about how to incorporate these findings into their practice. Many advisers make a mistake at this phase of the relationship because they approach it as purely a technical problem of making the best recommendations possible. Achieving that goal requires that the recommendations be expert, but also take into account the likelihood of being enacted. These recommendations include: 1. Obtain client buy-in. 2. Understand the client's past investment experiences. 3. Understand the ownership history of the client's existing investments. 4.

From a statistical standpoint, there is not a defined association between the cost of the CRM software and the benefits of more effective client service, increased revenue, or the ability to serve more clients. While cost is not statistically associated with these benefits, the use of specific functions does show a relationship between specific functions and these benefits.

Prior to last year, 529 plan investment election switches could only be made once a year-assuming one didn't go through the cumbersome exercise of rolling 529 funds into different new accounts with different investment choices. For 2009, that annual switching limit was doubled -- a change that may be made permanent. James Holtzman, CFP, CPA, of Legend Financial Advisors in Pittsborgh, says he often encourages clients to use a ""multi-account"" approach and not put all college savings in the 529 basket. Holtzman encourages some of his Pennsylvania resident clients to diversify their market risk by taking partial advantage of the states pre-paid tuition plan. In theory, pre-paid plans provide an investment return equal to the rate of college tuition inflation.","Stolz, Richard F",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Feb,2010

So, when considering a new product for possible client implementation, the author always begin by reminding himself of what he likes to call Wagner's Third Law of Financial Planning: Don't do anything stupid. Financial planners can employ a combination of policies and products to navigate the obvious conflicts, contradictions and trade-offs contained in some ideals.

It compares the results of this dynamic strategy to standard static portfolio allocations based on Modern Portfolio Theory to determine whether such a strategy is optimal. The authors created six portfolios using historical data (1926-2008) from two asset classes: US large-cap equities and US intermediate-term government bonds. The six portfolios were examined for 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, and 7% withdrawal rates over 30- and 40-year annual rolling periods from 1927-2008. As the investing period increased, the dynamic portfolio tended to outperform the 100% equity portfolio. This paper concludes that a dynamic asset allocation using a 12-month simple moving average is a consistently better strategy over statically allocated portfolios for investors in both the accumulation and withdrawal phases.","Garrison, Michael M, CFP;Sera, Carlos M;Cribbs, Jeffrey G, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Feb,2010

Ideally the LLC is set up by the original owners with input from the family on the terms of the operating agreement.

Over the past 10-15 years, however, proposals to subject the inside build-up or death benefits of life insurance to income taxation have been raised by members of Congress and the Treasury as a means of increasing governmental revenue. Under Notice 2009-48, a life insurance policy is considered to be issued upon the later of: 1. the date of application for coverage, 2. the effective date of coverage, and 3. the formal issuance of the contract. When engaging in entity purchase buy-sell planning with clients, keeping the 101(j) rules in mind is important.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CLU, CFA",1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,10-Jan,2010

JFP,Achieving Sustainable Retirement Withdrawals: A Combined Equity and Annuity Approach,"This article contrasts sustainable retirement withdrawals from strategies with annuity components and strategies without annuity components. The authors discuss today's market environment as it affects retirement panning strategies with and without annuity components. This study evaluates common retirement planning strategies by analyzing the withdrawal stability for portfolios consisting of equity, fixed income, variable annuity, and fixed annuity assets. This article uses replacement Monte Carlo methodology to determine retirement success over investor accumulation and withdrawal phases. The goal of each trial was to secure calculated retirement funding rather than to maximize wealth. Different rebalancing strategies were modeled to capture any variances between frequency. Portfolios composed of a higher portion of equities outperformed those with a higher portion of bonds. The results indicate that using an equity portfolio with a fixed annuity component provides a higher chance of maintaining retirement distributions than other alternatives.","Lemoine, Craig, CFP;Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Gustafson, A William, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10-Jan,2010

This paper presents a model that financial planners could use in helping them build a trusting relationship with their baby boomer widow clients. The author conducted a systematic grounded theory qualitative study that involved interviewing eight financial planners and 12 of their baby boomer widow clients. The findings of the model suggest specific actions to take and qualities to exhibit for a financial planner to be successful in building a trusting relationship with a baby boomer widow client.

The primary goal in using the pyramid is to help clients focus on becoming their ""ideal selves"" at its apex. The ultimate goal of financial planning is to help clients gain a sense of subjective well-being, balance, and abundance. A hypothetical initial client meeting illustrates the use of the Happiness Risk/Reward Pyramid. Further applications of the pyramid include clarifying the relationship between risk and reward, building a financial planning partnership, managing emotions for client and planner, working with clients' money beliefs, dealing with client discomfort, and facilitating communication.

JFP,Long-Term Approaches to Managing Retirement Healthcare Costs,"Retirement healthcare costs are a long-term financial liability. Financial planners can serve as an important resource in helping their retired clients manage these costs wisely. Typically, individuals incur almost two-thirds of their retirement healthcare costs during the last half of their retirement. In early retirement, many healthy people seek to reduce costs by enrolling in certain types of lower-premium coverage. In later retirement as they may need more medical services, some retirees plan to switch to more comprehensive coverage. Financial planners can help retired clients assess their various coverage options by using a process that includes estimating the price of excellent insurance, and identifying the client's selection criteria, including good catastrophic protection. At the end of the evaluation process, clients will know that the coverage that they select meets their selection criteria and will understand the tradeoffs when selecting among the options under consideration.","Armes, David, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Dec,2009
JFP,PRACTICE TRENDS: Client Segmentation: What Planners Are (and Are Not) Doing,"In general, about 70% of advisers are segmenting their clients and are using a variety of both subjective and objective methods. From a business perspective, client segmentation is focused on finding ways to improve your bottom line by either helping you identify and therefore prospect individuals who are like your best clients or by pointing out areas where you are expending too many or too few resources for what the client relationship warrants. There are a variety of objective metrics that can be applied to client segmentation processes. The most popular methods include the amount of assets the client has given to the practice to manage, the length of the client relationship, and the amount of revenue the client relationship generates for the practice. While nearly 70% of advisers report using at least one client segmentation method, only 31.5% report actually forming their clients into assigned segments or groups.","King, Rebecca",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,10,1,11,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Dec,2009
JFP,The Use and Misuse of Ascertainable Standards in Trusts,"Contemporary estate plans frequently employ ascertainable standards that limit distributions to beneficiaries to amounts needed for their health, education, support, and maintenance. The use -- or non-use -- of these standards not only affects the nature and amount of distributions to beneficiaries but also has significant gift, estate, and income tax consequences. The theoretical underpinning for the ascertainable standard doctrine is the assumption that the terms health, education, support, and maintenance are sufficiently objective as to render the trustee's authority determinable and enforceable by the courts and to permit the beneficiaries to compel the trustee, through judicial action if necessary, to make or refrain from making distributions. In light of this assumption, this article examines the tax consequences arising from the use of ascertainable standards. It will begin by examining the tax consequences of the rise of ascertainable standards.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Dec,2009

The strategy employed has no defined relationship to either the years of experience the adviser has in giving advice to retired clients or the number of clients in or near retirement the adviser serves. Advisers were asked to provide the percent of their retired, or nearly retired, clients who delayed their retirement date, plan to become re-employed, needed to significantly re-adjust their lifestyle due to economic needs, or made no significant changes over the last 12 months.

When asked which of seven methods of communication they use regularly for contacting clients, the largest number of advisers chose the telephone, at 72.3%. Advisers seemed split on whether a common reason for communicating with clients was to educate them on a particular topic, with about half selecting this reason.

This article will address the assumptions that market movements are best depicted by a normal, Gaussian distribution and that markets are totally random. It will incorporate existing and innovative approaches. Financial planning software, based upon modern portfolio theory or Monte Carlo simulations, tends to group the probabilities of market moves under the Gaussian distribution, that is, bell-shaped curve. This assumption leads to expectations and portfolios that may disappoint the owner: A more suitable portfolio-generating software would accept other distributions as more encompassing of market movements. The generation of portfolios from raw market data and the illustration of random behavior from a deterministic formula point to portfolios as an emergent phenomenon. The pursuit of emergent phenomena leads us to the Santa Fe Institutes mission of discovering the profound simplicity underlying the complexity that surrounds you.","Tomasula, Paul D, Jr, CLU, ChFC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Dec,2009

Roth Conversions in 2010,"It may be a seductive trap for some unwary taxpayers, and simply inappropriate for many of the rest, but the elimination of the income ceiling for Roth retirement account conversion eligibility next year is being hailed as a bonanza for financial planners. And indeed it is. Exuberance aside, there is little doubt that even with ongoing financial media frenzy about Roth conversions during the final run-up to 2010, there is still a large public education job to be done -- and who better to do it than planners. If Roth conversions were an all-or-nothing proposition, they probably would not be prudent under many scenarios, given the uncertainties, planners say. With all of the variables at play in the Roth conversion analysis, financial planning software makers have developed elaborate tools to help with the number crunching. And even if the planner is inclined to believe a Roth conversion doesn't make sense, that doesn't mean the topic should be avoided.","Stolz, Richard F",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Dec,2009

Transitions begin with an ending, typically a life event that breaks the status quo. Transition clients are different, but the same.

Kearns talked about financial planning in the past and the challenges to make the profession reach its full potential. The training level for participants in the financial community was pretty low. There are lots of good definitions of financial planning. But the term life planning starts with analysis, and there's something unique about financial planning. Kearns think the analysis is not statistical as much as it is sociological and psychological. He thinks the challenges for the profession to reach its full potential are to project in terms of PR into the financial knowledge of the public. The more that is done, the more people will accept the professionalism of the College for Financial Planning (certification), and greater will be the public acceptance.","Ritchlin, Lance",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Dec,2009

JFP,Managing Life Insurance: Loans or Withdrawals?,"Managing life insurance policies on which clients acquire loans is a challenge compared with policies with no indebtedness. The only way to see policy effects clearly is to obtain various illustrations showing future policy values in the presence of loans or cash withdrawals. Whole life policy loans and withdrawals have similar characteristics to universal life. Usually, loans will work better if the policy-owners intend to repay them, but withdrawals work better if the policy-owners do not intend to repay. Cash value (permanent) policies generate cash values that can be used for unexpected bridge borrowing, long-term funding, and to assist with retirement income. Whether money from policies is treated as a loan or withdrawal can produce significant differences in long-term policy values. Which is better depends on how long the money is needed. Short term usually favors taking loans. Long term usually favors using withdrawals.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Nov,2009

JFP,Results vs. Process: Analyzing the Future Benefit of Common Investment Policy Statement Provisions,"Having a formal investment process is becoming increasingly popular in 401(k) plans. While this process can take a variety of forms, the process is usually codified in what's known as all investment policy statement (IPS). While following a prudent process can provide the plan sponsor with some degree of legal protection, there has been little research into whether common IPS provisions actually lead to better outcomes for the client. The goal of any investment strategy should be to produce a positive outcome for an investor. While following a prudent process clearly has certain legal benefits, the analysis conducted for this paper suggests that common replacement provisions in investment policy statement do not necessarily add value ex-post from an outperformance perspective. This research suggests a simplistic approach to fund monitoring may in fact generate negative value, and that a passive strategy may be more suitable for investment professionals who are unable to quantify the actual benefit of their investment process.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,9-Nov,2009
JFP,Nine Steps for Calming Client Fears,"Faced with a fearful client, most advisers present page after page of charts, graphs, and numbers. They create various scenarios for what might reasonably happen, each one leading inexorably to the conclusion that all is well. Because client fear is so pervasive, consider building a fear assessment into your annual review meeting. It is always easier to deal with fears in their infancy than to counteract ""fear monsters"" when they reach epic proportions. The following nine-step procedure is one effective way to conduct a fear assessment: 1. Introduce the topic. 2. Get them talking freely. 3. Take notes as they talk. 4 Allow silence as they think. 5. Read the list back to them so they can clarify any point or add others. 6. Ask them to prioritize. 7. Help them imagine solutions. 8. Create a two-column table. 9. In subsequent meetings, conduct a fear and concern check-in.","Florian, Amy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Nov,2009
JFP,Is It Time to Review Your Review Meetings?,"Developing solid relationships with new clients is a challenge. It takes a long time and usually multiple meetings before the adviser sufficiently understands the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the new clients finances. Similarly clients need time and ongoing positive experiences before they can truly trust the new adviser's judgment and advice. Although you go into review meetings with an established relationship and an understanding of the client's goals and finances, that doesn't make the reviews any less important than initial meetings. From a business perspective, in fact, they may be more important, because established client incur the start-up costs of new relationships. According to the advisers interviewed for this article, the key to successful review sessions is to develop a structure that enhances preparation for client meetings and sets the critical content of those meetings with an agenda. The easiest way to get client input for the agenda is to ask for it.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,7,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Nov,2009

JFP,Potentially Devastating Social Security Offsets,"This study examines the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision within the Social Security system. These two rarely discussed provisions of the law are very important considerations for financial planners because these provisions probably have caused some financial planners' clients to seriously overestimate the Social Security benefit to which they will be entitled. The annual Social Security statement is a good starting point for families to use to estimate future benefits from the Social Security program. However, for those families in which either (or both) spouse(s) has a pension benefit from uncovered employment, the statement may grossly overstate the future benefits to be received. It is the responsibility of financial planners to recognize whether client families will be affected by one or both of these benefit-reducing provisions, and help families develop a financial strategy that accounts for these reductions.","McCormack, Joseph P, PhD, CFA;Perdue, Grady, PhD, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Nov,2009

Most successful financial planners use the concept of synergy in their practice. By carefully selecting professionals with complementary financial skills, today's financial professional employs a team approach to address a variety of issues. Members of the emerging team could include lifework planners, retirement coaches, personal growth coaches, and/or career transition coaches focusing on the needs of individuals age 55 or older. When working with new team members, developing a referral network is probably the easiest and most effective approach. It is easy to manage and has no financial commitments.

One of the concerns he has with financial planning today is that they are focused too much on the financial capital and not enough on the human capital. They focus on people's risk tolerance and time horizon without looking carefully at what their balance sheet really looks like, including human capital. A financial adviser should be segmenting an individual's needs into two groups: absolute must-haves and income above that that would be nice to obtain. So instead of starting with an actual allocation decision on one's entire financial capital, you have to start with a needs analysis and work your way backward from retirement.

Before getting into the actual rules of engagement, there are three philosophical underpinnings found in the Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility that embody the professional relationship a client has with a CFP certificant, in or out of a financial planning engagement: 1. integrity, 2. objectivity and 3. fairness.

In recent years, people have spoken to several individuals who were looking into the purchase of time-share intervals as an alternative to hotel rentals. A time-share interval can be defined as joint ownership or interest in property (for example, vacation condominium) for exclusive use during an agreed upon period each year. Being able to discuss time-share intervals with clients is quite important, especially when you consider that the typical purchaser is an affluent, well-educated baby boomer -- a demographic that often seeks financial advice. It should be helpful to be able to offer clients a non-biased comparison of the cashflows related to purchasing a time-share interval versus staying in vacation rentals -- a typical alternative.

This paper examines the recovery of the US market after extreme downturns and evaluates whether they follow the historical average results. Additionally, this paper seeks to observe the magnitude of the risk premiums during a recovery as an indication of the possible length of time it took for equities to recover after a market crash. This report analyzes the returns of the four major US equity asset classes during the 12-, 36-, and 60-month periods immediately after each major bear market. The authors' analysis found that risk premiums are above average in periods of extreme bear markets. The authors determined that in the historical periods observed, a well diversified portfolio would fully recover to pre-market crash levels in three to five years, with the main factor being the amount of allocation to small cap stocks.","Leonard, Scott A, CFP, CEA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Oct,2009

They are not equipped to regulate the financial planning process per se -- at least, not yet. Up to now, a suitability standard has been applied to many investments.

Ultimately, suitability will be judged based on investment outcomes, circumstances largely beyond the adviser's control. Based on the Advice Spectrum study recently conducted by Pershing LLC, investment-centric advisers create stock and bond portfolios and focus on portfolio management. The adviser does not offer planning services. A holistic financial plan is based on deep and often ""right-brained"" and emotional discussions about major life transactions. Broker-dealers, compliance officers, vendors, and professional organizations have a tremendous opportunity to train advisers in relationship-centric life planning.

Under some circumstances, the benefits from tax deferral can amount to the equivalent of earning more than 200 extra basis points per year relative to the taxable alternative. This tax advantage can be reduced or increased by embedded expense differentials between insurance products and alternative investments, depending upon the products employed.

This paper describes a new methodology for measuring the overall risk embedded within a retirement income plan, motivated by the existence of ""black swans,"" an idea introduced by Nassim Taleb in his best-selling book The Black Swan: The Impart of the Highly Improbable. The SORDEX ratio, which is fully explained and illustrated within the article, is defined by the simple relationship A/B - 1, where A is retirement income sustainability given current conditions and B is retirement income sustainability under extreme conditions. The greater the value of this SORDEX ratio, the more vulnerable is the retirement income plan to a black swan. The authors suggest that, for the purposes of implementation and using this new measure, extreme conditions should be defined as events that are likely to occur less than 1% of the time, within a three-year time frame.","Milevsky, Moshe A, PhD;Abaimova, Anna;Cavalieri, Brett, CFP, ChFC",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Oct,2009

JFP,Founders of the Profession Look Back on the Roots of Financial Planning,"With the financial planning profession celebrating its 40th anniversary, two of its founders, Lewis G. Kearns, 95, and James R. Johnston, 76, recently took the opportunity to reflect on the profession's humble beginnings. On Dec 12, 1969, 13 individuals with various backgrounds and interests in financial products and services gathered in Chicago to consider a more integrated, client-centered approach. Before integrated financial planning, clients who wanted to get their financial lives in order might visit an insurance agent first, to buy a life insurance policy. Johnston is waging a one-man campaign to achieve recognition for Kearns, whose contributions he believes had huge implications not only for financial planning but for the study of microeconomics.","Ritchlin, Lance",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Oct,2009
JFP,Navigate Your Way Through the Career Path Forest,"As the financial planning profession matures, it's moving toward a critical crossroads: how will the profession as a whole, and individual planners in particular, handle the upcoming transition of practices from the hands of experienced planners to mid-career planners, today's graduates, and career changers who are streaming into the field. Because the profession is relatively new, the first wave of major retirements is around the corner at a time when entry points into the field and career path progression aren't well established. The challenges the profession as a whole is struggling with mirror many of the challenges individual planners are facing. But with a commitment to professionalism and sound business practices, the industry and its practitioners can surmount these challenges to usher in an era in which the profession is held in high regard by a public that values financial planning services, and can support the career paths and career development needed to move to the next level.","Buttell, Amy E",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Oct,2009

JFP,The Emerging Adult and the Financial Planner: Seven Years Later,"Since the 1960s, many psychologists and sociologists have used a developmental model created by psychoanalyst Erik Erikson. This model organized the human lifespan into eight stages extending from birth to death. The phenomenon of extended adolescence has been recognized by psychologists as a distinct new period of life that will be around for many generations to come. Based on his research, Jeffrey Arnett reports that emerging adults -- young people between age 18 and the late 20s -- see three cornerstones for achieving true adulthood: accepting responsibility for your actions, making independent decisions, and becoming financially independent. If your clients decide to provide financial assistance, it is important for them to clarify up front whether such financial assistance is conditional or unconditional. Emerging adulthood confronts parents with serious life challenges. The emerging adult continues to need his or her parents' psychological and emotional support, and sometimes their financial support.","Gallo, Eileen, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Oct,2009

Beyond the predominately technical papers, the Journal has published several articles examining the quest for professional status. Over the years, the media, public, and regulators have come to rely on such pioneering research and commentary in the Journal because of its quality, reliability, and objectivity. The Journal has been a leader in exploring what has become, with considerable debate, the growing acceptance of life planning, recognizing that financial planning involves the heart as well as the dollars. The journal also was among the first publications to move planners and their clients away from the idea that retirement (from a financial and psychological standpoint) is a discrete end point where you collect your gold watch and go home.","Most, Bruce",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Oct,2009

JFP,Market Cycles and Safe Withdrawal Rates,"Financial markets move in long-run cycles. These long-run patterns of the US financial market -- called secular cycles -- significantly affect safe withdrawal rates (SWR). This paper covers the history of US secular cycles over 120 years, the mechanism leading to cyclic market behavior; and why financial planners should be aware of long-run market cycles when developing suitabte SWRs. Secular cycles are examined using the behavior of the S&amp;F 500 Composite Index from 1881-2000. During this period, the average annualized compound growth rate of the index was 4.8%. In comparison, during this same period the annualized compound growth rate of the four secular bull and four secular bear markets averaged 3.3% and -1.4% respectively. Secular market cycles can result in lower SWRs because the sequence of investment returns matters in the presence of recurring portfolio withdrawals. Financial planners can benefit from an awareness of secular market cycles by considering their effect on sequence risk when forming SWR recommendations.","Harris, John, PhD, CFP, RFC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Sep,2009

Not only do consumers with different asset levels have different financial characteristics, they also engage in the planning relationship differently. Understanding the drivers to professional advice and the typical method by which a financial planning client compensates their adviser based on asset distinctions should help you consider whether your practice model is suited to the type of client you are targeting.

JFP,The Future of Retirement Investing,"Recent market declines are responsible for erasing decades of wealth building by investors who are in or near retirement. A recent Gallup Poll shows that for the first time this decade, a majority of non-retired Americans, 52%, doubt that they will have enough money to live on comfortably once they retire. Retirees of the future know they'll have to reduce needless expenses and somehow convert their portfolio of stocks and mutual funds into one that generates as much income as possible during retirement. One way of accomplishing their retirement goals is for these investors to swap 100% of their equity and bond mutual fund holding for a similar exchange-traded fund (ETF). ETFs are highly liquid securities with ultra-low management fees that can be 80% less than a typical mutual fund. However, the main advantage in taking an old school approach to invest is the ability to sell call option premium on the ETFs now owned in the account.","Ulivieri, William, AIFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,9-Sep,2009

Quantitative models (quant models) are the turbo-charged workhorses of the financial world. These mathematical models use the science of statistics and probability to determine the construction of investment products and investment portfolios. Quantitative models are so vital for keeping the financial industry running, it's hard to imagine how professional investors would conduct themselves each day if they did not have them. Many planners simply do not have the time to follow all of the complicated micro- and macroeconomic variables needed to manage a portfolio by any other methodology. Quant models are also necessary for the institutional money management industry. The Nobel Prize-winning field of behavioral finance gives investors another good reason to embrace quantitative decision-making.

It's all based on the simple principles of work hard and earn a decent living, spend less, invest to put your money to work for you, get an estate plan and insurance in place for protection. The research clearly showed them that there are seven distinct traits of the wealthy personality -- optimism, resilience, connectedness, drive, curiosity, intuition, and confidence.

Yet most planners point to years of bad behavior catching up with these individuals, usually linked to an excess of credit card and home-equity borrowing. Planners are justified in feeling battle fatigue not only after such a tough 12 months, but after nearly a decade with clients seeing very little portfolio growth overall. According to a survey earlier this year by Spectrem Group, only 36% of millionaires think their financial advisers performed well during the market turmoil of the past year, and only 14% said that they would increase their use of financial advisers in the future.

The study found that only 33% of respondents believe the current value of their business is $1 million or more, but 65% believe their business will be worth $1 million or more at retirement. Business owners with unrealistic expectations of value may have to confront the prospect of delaying retirement or adjusting their lifestyle for lower retirement income.

JFP,Life Insurance in Times of Uncertainty,"Through the 1970s, there were two primary types of insurance policies -- term and whole life. Term allowed all insured to purchase inexpensive protection for a specified period, usually one year. Whole life offered permanent protection at a fixed rate throughout the insured's lifetime, in contrast to the increasing cost of term insurance, provided that the premium is paid. The primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be death benefit protection. Most individuals will need to employ life insurance as part of an overall financial plan to ensure their family is taken care of due to the early death of a breadwinner. Fixed income investments also provide all opportunity for investors to take advantage of temporary down market cycles by creating the liquidity to purchase attractive equity assets at low cost. As the events of the last year or so have demonstrated, in low interest rate and down market environments, whole life insurance policies are an attractive alternative to other funding vehicles.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,9-Sep,2009

One is that employees require training on the systems. Before technology can help you achieve maximum efficiency, you need to create efficient processes within your office.

When funneling down to the investment vehicle itself though, planners often make product selections based on the technical side of comparing one investment to another by analyzing various screens. The FPA Research Center conducted a Trends in Investing study in 2008 and 2009, asking members the frequency with which they use a laundry list of potential screening factors for investment vehicles. This article also provides comparisons between the 2009 and 2008 studies, but because the answer options were slightly different in each survey, it only points to percentage differences where stark shifts are apparent. It may be expected that planners will always place greater value on the long-term investment performance screen than on short-term performance, and the survey bears this out, along with other intuitive results.","Nelson, Christina",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Sep,2009

JFP,Out of Bounds: Cross-Border Planning,"Globalization has been shattering barriers not only to international commerce, but to international living. And the growing ranks of people and families with substantial assets and legal connections outside the US are giving rise to a complex but potentially rewarding professional niche: ""cross-border financial planning."" Meanwhile, experienced cross-border planners (CBPs), happy to share accounts of the rewards and challenges of their multinational careers, warn that cross-border planning presents a minefield of legal and financial traps for the novice or unwary, and thus is not a fail-safe opportunity for mere dabblers or short-term opportunists. Indeed, pioneering CBPs themselves didn't embark on their careers with the idea of inventing a new category of financial planning.

And among investors with a formal plan, 21% consider their plan extremely important to their financial planning efforts, up 16% from last year.

JFP,How Much Is That Basis Point Worth?,"Mutual fund expense ratios and loads, along with adviser fees and wrap account charges, are among the many ways in which investors pay for investment management. Unfortunately, to assess trade-offs between alternative fee arrangements expressed in fractions of a percentage point requires a facility with exponential series (that is, time value of money calculations) that too many investors lack. The proper procedure is not to focus on the magnitude of the expense ratio in relation to the forecast returns, but to calculate dollar results for the two exponential series. All basis points are not created equal when they figure in exponential series. This is the dark side of what is sometimes referred to as the magic of compound interest. The higher the rate of return, the more costly a single basis point of additional expense becomes. Wrap fees can be far more expensive than they first appear.","McQuarrie, Edward F, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Aug,2009
JFP,Good Grief,"Although most of the people probably think about taxes when estate planning is mentioned, there are important non-tax considerations. For many years, the American Bar Association's (ABA) focus on these non-tax issues was directed at such technical topics as valuation, insurance, and asset protection planning. Seven years ago, the ABA's Section on Real Property, Trust, and Estate Law established the Committee on the Emotional and Psychological Issues in Estate Planning. For more than a year, a substantial portion of the Committee's monthly telephone conference has dealt with one of the most paradoxical issues facing those people who are routinely involved in postmortem estate planning, a term commonly used to refer to the implementation of estate plans after the death of the testator.

JFP,Comparing Strategies for Retirement Wealth Management: Mutual Funds and Annuities,"This article compares wealth management strategies for individuals in retirement, focusing on trade-offs regarding wealth creation and income security. Systematic withdrawals from mutual funds usually give opportunities for greater wealth creation at the risk of large investment losses and income shortfalls. Fixed and variable life annuities forgo bequest considerations and distribute the highest incomes. Defined contribution plan participants should be aware of contract terms, because fees and charges play a nontrivial role in altering wealth creation and income levels. In-plan institutional pricing of funds may provide better opportunities than lump sum purchase on retail terms. None of the strategies obviously dominates, so the best advice may be to segment wealth to establish minimum necessary consumption and hedge against longevity risk, then focus on growth opportunities. Investors should also optimize portfolios to account for benefits from defined benefit plans and Social Security.","Pang, Gaobo, PhD;Warshawsky, Mark J, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Aug,2009

Approximately 25% of the respondents' contact with clients is devoted to non-financial issues. About 74% of planners estimate that the amount of time they are spending on these issues has increased over the last five years. Most respondents believe that their non-financial coaching and counseling makes them better planners and helps their clients, but are less certain that these activities increase business. Planners help clients with critical issues that reflect human drama and frailties: religion and spirituality, death, family dysfunction, illness, divorce, and depression. Most respondents have at least some training to equip them to help clients with non-financial issues, but 40% have had no training or professional development in this area.","Dubofsky, David, PhD, CFA;Sussman, Lyle, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Aug,2009

It's an important question -- even more now that exchange-traded funds offer large and small investors alike the opportunity to index virtually all corners of the capital markets. Everybody likes to outperform, and mutual funds that outperform their peers are lauded for their success. In some studies of index vs. active, performance is treated as a binary variable. ""Price"" refers to the management fees charged by active funds. A knock against active management is that it is doomed to fail. The world of investing can easily accommodate both actively managed and index funds.

Large institutions become extremely distressed, credit markets start to break down and stop functioning properly, interest rates on anything but the absolute safest government-issued debt suddenly get quite high. She also said that the danger zone goes back to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organizing a $3.6 billion bailout of Long Term Capital Management during the Asian crisis.

Physical fatigue, lack of mental clarity, stress exhaustion, and fractured focus diminish your ability to connect with clients, which is essential to building trust.

At-Risk Middle American households often lack the financial resources, preparation, support systems, and protections to carry them through the rest of their lives, and they are particularly vulnerable to the retirement decumulation crisis. Financially, mentally, and culturally, At-Risk Middle Americans are terribly unprepared to fund their third stage of life. This paper presents the findings of a NEFE think tank addressing decumulation issues for this population, the most important of which address eight critical decision zones: work, Social Security, the house, insurance products, defined benefits pensions, defined contribution plans, debt, and fraud. The paper reviews changes in media attention brought about by recent economic developments, but concludes that, whether by design or default, the specifics of how these households will manage to pay themselves a regular retirement paycheck will go unanswered unless Americans work together to reach At-Risk Middle America.","Neiser, Brent A, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jul,2009

Today, many planners are getting a crash course in keeping marital intolerance from defeating a financial plan -- and in avoiding getting sucked into the maelstrom. Another estate planning decision that frequently causes tension involves the decision of what to leave to children from a prior marriage, according to Patrick Dougherty, CFP, of Dougherty Financial Management in Dallas, TX. A final common source of conflict between spouses, seasoned planners say, involves varying levels of risk tolerance. Some disagreements can be resolved with a creative compromise engineered by the planner. Unfortunately, there are times when a simple compromise or a creative, if not simple, solution cannot bridge the gap.

Gender is an issue in calculations because future cash flows are weighted by the probability of living to receive them. In this study, a man's life expectancy is used to weight the cash flows at various ages. SS cash flows are relatively certain, barring the very real possibility of the government changing current law. This paper will combine the two cash flows to arrive at an optimal retirement age under normal market conditions and different proportions of income derived from SS.

The author presents a Resilient Capital Planning model for executive compensation, estate planning and philanthropy designed to integrate the personal and business demands related to many facets of business owner planning. The model relies upon three core tool sets: self-correcting strategies, values-based decision-making, and dynamic stress-testing through the use of scenarios. The model stress-testing goes far beyond simple sensitivity analysis. The entire plan is mapped and then programmatically challenged using classical scenario analysis. This model helps articulate and document the business owner plan so the entire advisory team can coordinate effectively.

According to Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, author of On Death and Dying, advisers need to: 1. Maintain your boundaries. 2. Talk to your colleagues. 3. Break your isolation. The financial planning profession is at a crossroad. You may not be able to predict how the profession will change.","Pullen, Courtney",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jun,2009

JFP,PRACTICE TRENDS: Planners Adjust to Evolving Recession,"Planners are adjusting to work life in the current down economy in many ways -- some involving cutbacks, others demanding greater effort. The Market Volatility Study conducted with the FPA Research Group last October found that, prior to September 2008, planners spent an average of 11.61 hours per week with clients, rising to 17.74 hours in October 2008. When asked the same question in the February 2009 Practice Trends Study, the mean value dropped back to 14.27 hours. Planners use a variety of vehicles to communicate with current and prospective clients, but the most popular methods involve personal interaction. The top communication method selected by respondents to the Trends Study this February was personal phone calls. Face-to-face meetings came in second. In the Volatility Survey, about 42% of planners had experienced no change in their client base over the past year; that figure dropped to about 17% in February.","Nelson, Christina",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jun,2009

Tim Kochis, J.D., CFP, CEO of Aspiriant, doesn't think that the market downturn, deep and as rapid as it's been, has caused them to change their principles on asset allocation. The current market environment impresses them as being merely an intense case. The presumption is that defined benefit plans in this environment are doing just fine, and he doesn't think they know that, says Cornerstone Wealth Advisors Inc principal, CFP, Jonathan T. Guyton. Roy T. Diliberto, CFP, CLU, ChFC, chairman of RTD Financial Advisors Inc, said they changed their fee structure some years ago to retainers that are not percentages of assets under management, although they do have some of their clients who have not converted.","Nelson, Christina;Ritchlin, Lance",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jun,2009
JFP,CFP Board Chair Dimitroff on a Fortified Duty of Care and How Obama Will Treat Advisers,"In an interview, Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Board of Directors (CFP) chairman Marilyn Capelli Dimitroff talked about CFP Board's latest ethical standards and how the planner community has taken to them. She also addresses the new presidential leadership and her hopes for reform. Dimitroff thinks without a doubt the most significant change in its ethical standards is the requirement that CFP certificants must at all times place the interest of the client ahead of his or her own. They believe that the revisions not only make the standards stronger but also are clearer, more enforceable, and more relevant to the financial planning profession. One of the distinguishing characteristics of CFP certification is that they put teeth into their ethical standards. The CFP marks are not just something easy to obtain or maintain. They have hopes for reform via regulation or legislation whereby financial planning will be recognized as a profession in which folks are required to deliver services at a fiduciary level.","Aschkenasy, Janet",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jun,2009

In evaluating the replacement of a car with a more fuel-efficient can it also explores loan balance, monthly payment and number of remaining payments for the currently owned vehicle; estimated annual repair cost for non-standard maintenance after the existing warranty has expired; and estimated annual insurance cost for each vehicle. The down payment on the new car is assumed to include the net trade-in value of the currently owned automobile. The authors conclude that, despite high costs for gasoline, in most situations it is difficult to justify the purchase of a hybrid vehicle based solely on the economics of the transaction.","Barker, Robert L, PhD, CPA;Clouse, Ronald;Stout, Thomas G;Stout, Gary R, DBA, CPA/PFS",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jun,2009

But population is scarce and there is little to no infrastructure. Demographics, psychographics, the fallout from the bear market meltdown, and an energized and activist regulatory climate, has changed the game. A recent survey noted that even with a growing shift from commissions to fees, in the financial services industry as a whole, fees account for 35% of revenues. Conversely, 65% of revenues are from transactions. If the only source of compensation is a commission, a product is the focus -- not advice about lift solutions and non-financial resources. That is what the regulators worry about. Currently, within the universe of financial consultants and brokers of all stripes, percentage-wise such multi-faceted holistic advisers are a rare breed with the potential to rule the savannah.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CIMC, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,9-Jun,2009
JFP,PRACTICE TRENDS: Making the Most of Your Professional Network,"Two essential components of financial planning are the creation and monitoring of the financial plan/planner recommendations and the implementation of the plan through the purchase of various investment products. While financial planners are typically involved in both aspects of a client's financial situation, the general regulatory environment can create challenges in managing these components of a client's financial plan. Registration can affect both your access to products and flexibility in generating revenue. Seventy-nine percent of dually-registered advisers believe that their dual registration grants them access to a wider range of products than they would have with a single registration. For those who do not want to pursue or maintain dual registration, this shows an opportunity for Investment Adviser Representatives and registered reps to form mutually beneficial professional alliances. A partnership that results in referrals or revenue sharing can help provide additional flexibility without requiring a change in registration.","King, Rebecca",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jun,2009

As professional financial planners, one of the most important elements of their advice relates to investment planning. In order to provide that advice, they must have a philosophy regarding appropriate portfolio design. Not because of the challenge to MPT, but rather as it may encourage you to think through the substance of the challenge and motivate you to revisit and, if appropriate, either confirm or revise your current beliefs.

The 2009 Annual Letter from the Gates Foundation not only boasts a mere 20% decrease in foundation assets for 2008, but announces an increase in foundation giving for 2009. Financial planners might contemplate Gates's assertiveness and redouble their own charitable consulting efforts. Historical evidence shows recessions do not portend the end of philanthropy. Charitable lead trusts (CLT) lead the pack of favorite giving techniques among experts interviewed by the Journal. Unlike the charitable remainder trust which creates current income for the donor and a deferred gift to charity, CLTs create current gifts to charity and a deferred gift to either the donor (in the case of a grantor CLT) or the donor's heirs (in the case of a non-grantor or family CLT).","Grote, Jim, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jun,2009

The media have publicized a few of these strategies, but there is hidden treasure in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and other recent legislation. Over half the workers in the US will benefit from the making-work-pay credit included in the ARRA. Two changes are directed at retirees. First, qualified retirees, disabled individuals, and supplemental security income recipients, including many government retirees who are not eligible for Social Security benefits, will receive a $250 one-time payment in 2009. Second, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 suspended the required minimum distributions from retirement accounts in 2009. The ARRA provides estimated tax relief to individuals with 2008 adjusted gross income less than $500,000 who certify that at least 50% of their gross income came from a business that employed fewer than 500 persons during the year.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,9-Jun,2009

In the second quarter of 2008, Cerulli Associates examined this very issue with FPA's membership in a survey. They asked advisers again in November to rate the importance of a variety of business benefits that financial planning offers their practice. Nearly two-thirds of respondents indicated that they view financial planning services as a revenue generator independent of investment advice. There is one area of disconnect, however. Eighty-five percent of respondents said they are willing to offer financial plans as a value-added service, yet 66% seek to profit from financial planning services. It is interesting to note that, while 85% of advisers agree that clients are demanding more comprehensive services, less than half of clients are actually receiving a comprehensive plan.

This paper hypothesizes that a person's income variability is occupation-specific and that an occupational income beta, using a best fit index can be developed for any occupation. Occupational income betas, the outcome from this study, can be used by financial advisers as an asset allocation tool when developing and rebalancing client portfolios. This paper establishes beta coefficients for a variety of occupations relative to stocks, bonds, and T-bills. The paper establishes goodness of fit to determine the amount of explained variance using r2, finding, in most cases, that variations in occupational incomes could only be somewhat explained, and that, in most cases, the explained variance was low.

JFP,CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS: Understand Consumer Spending to Better Serve Clients,"This article analyzes some of the data from the 2007 Consumer Expenditure Survey in attempt to help financial planners better understand the spending habits of different target markets according to income levels and specific client situations, such as preparing for retirement or recently divorced. Americans modestly increased their spending in 2007, keeping pace with inflation -- a smaller spending increase than reported the year before, which could indicate overall tighter budgeting and fiscal responsibility. The average American household's before-tax income in 2007 was $63,091, a 29% increase from the average $44,649 reported in 2000. The staggering number of baby boomers planning for and entering retirement means financial planners are faced with the challenge of helping these clients anticipate post-retirement spending, budgeting, and withdrawal strategies. Planning for healthcare costs is one of the great unknowns in financial planning. What planners can do, however, is help clients estimate their annual healthcare spending, based on national averages for their age group.","Schulaka, Carly",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jun,2009

On the other hand, many small businesses are not only surviving, they're exhibiting confidence about the future. According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses have historically helped stem the effects of the kind of crisis people are now experiencing: following the recession of the 1990s, new small businesses helped usher in an era of tremendous prosperity by creating 3.8 million jobs, a figure that surpassed big business expansion by nearly 500,000. In an odd way, this may be one of the best times for financial planners to market to and work with small-business clients.

One solution currently capturing much attention has the generic name of protected investment product (PIP), or principal protected security (PPS). A common form of PIP is an equity indexed annuity (EIA) contract, offered primarily through banks and insurance agents.

The investor buys an insurance contract that is guaranteed by the general assets of the underwriting company.

JFP,Sticking to Our Principles,"Shortly after the State of the Union address, Pres Obama discussed his desire regarding a revamp of financial services regulation. Most of the President's comments concerned large structural issues that affect capital formation and laid out some basic principles, with little said about the regulation of advice. A few organizations that view financial planning as a distinct profession have come together to espouse a united message. As you may have heard, FPA, CFP Board, and NAPFA have created the Financial Planning Coalition, and declared a few commonalities. For many, there were times when financial planning felt like being in the publishing business, all geared to producing a book of data that clients found hard to absorb. These concerns also surfaced during the development of practice standards. There must be standards in place for how planners conduct their planning work if planning is to have any meaning. The financial planning profession had already laid out the principles it would like to see.","Moisand, Dan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-May,2009

The 1980 results from the President's Commission seemed adequate for a period of time, until the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Since tax rates are a key driver of the replacement ratio, it prompted their interest in knowing how those changing rates would affect the replacement ratio. On a relative basis, higher income people get less tax relief at retirement; thus, the higher replacement ratio. Lower income people can exclude a larger percentage of their Social Security benefits from taxation. The Pension Protection Act certainly offers a lot of ways to help people help themselves. It makes it easier, but it doesn't force them. As people migrate to a defined contribution world, they're losing a very important protection -- longevity protection.","Lee, Shelley A",0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-May,2009
JFP,'Millennials': Strategies for Financial Planning with a New Generation,"Financial planners are undoubtedly aware of the importance of anticipating change. Nothing is more disturbing to a financial planner than when a breadwinner becomes disabled without disability insurance or dies without life insurance. Financial planners continually prepare clients for change -- yet many financial planners themselves may not be prepared for changes that will affect their practices. This paper presents evidence that will help financial planners understand the next generation of financial planning clients, the Millennial generation. This group's significance will continue to rise as they inherit the vast wealth accumulated by their baby boomer parents. Given limited promotional budgets, financial planners need to consider the characteristics most valued by potential Millennial clients. Planners who want to target Millennials can benefit from understanding the basis on which they will be evaluated. A financial planner hoping to capture Millennials as future clients may be better served by charging an hourly fee for services instead of working on commission.","Johnson, Scott D, PhD;Larson, Stephen J, PhD, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-May,2009

Over the past six months, the author has faced situations he had not previously encountered. Clients and potential clients have reached out to him for advice when they were at the edge of the financial cliff, ready to jump off. The most irrational reaction involved a potential client who decided to start a non-deductible IRA and put the entire investment amount into the stock of one company in 2008. The stock had become completely worthless by the end of 2008, and the potential client contacted him to discuss whether this loss could be deducted on his 2008 tax return. Perhaps the best news released over the past six months is the suspension of the IRA minimum withdrawal rules for 2009.","Cocozza, Christopher R, CPA, JD, LLM",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,9-May,2009
JFP,The Roth IRA for Children: Multigenerational Wealth Planning,"The Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA) was established under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and has become a popular investment strategy. As expected, most investors in Roth IRAs are working adults. However, children (even very young ones) can make qualified Roth IRA contributions if they have compensation. The traditional IRA was introduced under the Employee Retirement Income Security Art of 1974 (ERISA) and offered tax-deferred growth on investments. In 1997, legislators went a step further and created another kind of IRA, commonly referred to as the Roth IRA, for the legislation's chief sponsor, Senator William V. Roth of Delaware, which offered tax-free growth on investments. A key difference between the Roth and traditional IRA concerns the taxation of contributions. The strongest argument for young Roth IRA owners and their beneficiaries is clear; competitive tax-free growth. The authors encourage professional planners to consider this highly tax-advantageous multigenerational wealth planning strategy.","Haug, Mark G, PhD, JD;Cichelli, Adrienne G",0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-May,2009

JFP,Developing a Tech Strategy,"You can't run a financial planning or wealth management business without the right technology. But for some advisors, technology is as much a source of aggravation as profit. Their frustration is understandable because it seems they are always reacting to unwanted tech changes that are beyond their control. In contrast, other advisors are satisfied with their systems. This article explores how these advisors have mastered their systems and shares their insights for getting in front of the tech curve. Once you've developed a strategic plan and identified your firm's core strategies, it's time to include a technology strategy. The arrangements of who makes the tech decisions vary among advisors. No matter how your firm manages technology, however, failing to develop a tech strategy or abdicating responsibility for that strategy to a third party is risky. Staying current with technology isn't an option -- it's a critical element to developing and maintaining a viable strategy that keeps you in front of change.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Apr,2009

Two notable characteristics of hedge funds include market neutrality and the potential to increase diversification in a portfolio. Seven sources of risk are high leverage, liquidity risk, pricing risk, reporting risk, fee risk, operating/cash management risk, and attrition risk. The nature of each risk is explored. A comprehensive example, using currency futures, illustrates how a specific strategy may be used in a hedge fund. It assures planners that complexities surrounding hedge funds are overstated and that investment alternatives are within the grasp of most planners. Use of the unbiased hypothesis relative to the random walk hypothesis helps to explain currency markets. The unbiased hypothesis states that the forward rate is the best predictor of the spot rate for the future.

The convergence of these and other trends may move the profession from ""thinking like a CFP"" and ""feeling like a CFP"" to ""acting like a CFP."" Financial planning has been misguided in seeking to self-proclaim that it is a profession. The public must come naturally to recognize financial planning as a profession through the actions of individual planners.

JFP,A Dynamic and Adaptive Approach to Distribution Planning and Monitoring,"This paper advances the ""second-generation approach"" to the sustainable withdrawal rate question. The study evaluates the ongoing sustainability of the withdrawal rate that is revisited every year. This adaptive approach recognizes that sustainability decisions do not occur just once at retirement, but should change as situations warrant throughout retirement. To support ongoing sustainability decisions, annual probability of failure of the current withdrawal rate is presented in this paper, summarized in five-year slices through the data. As a person ages, this allows for slowly changing to higher withdrawal rates associated with those shorter remaining distribution periods. Revisiting the withdrawal annually allows for higher withdrawal rates if the portfolio performs well, for unplanned or unforeseen additional expenses, or for lowering withdrawal rates if the portfolio is underperforming. The revisiting approach introduced in this paper is simpler than some of the complex decision rules that have been previously introduced, and is therefore easier to implement and change as the client ages and portfolio values change.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA;Frank, Larry R, Sr, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,9-Apr,2009

Financial planners are mostly interested in helping clients arrive at a particular destination, like retirement. She personally believes that people all have a natural ability to have greater harmony with money in their lives. They can learn to have better access to money and to have greater abundance. Unfortunately, not everybody knows that this is true, or knows how to access that flow. Money coaching is a process that allows you to have greater understanding and compassion for your clients and to create strategies and structures for them that make them less likely to veer off course from their desired destination.","Stolz, Richard F",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Apr,2009

A CLT is an irrevocable trust to which the donor transfers income-producing property. The CLT makes payments to one or more charities for a number of years specified in the trust document. The transfer of assets to the CLT is treated as a taxable gift by the donor to the noncharitable beneficiaries. The donor will receive an income-tax charitable deduction only if the CLT is structured as a grantor trust, with the result that the donor will also recognize phantom taxable income during the term of the CLT. CLTs are not particularly good vehicles for transferring assets to grandchildren or other skip persons. In today's low-interest environment, CLTs provide the estate planning client with more bang for the buck than ever.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Apr,2009

The objective of this research is to try to determine to what extent the results of the simpler income replacement approach identify different ""needs,"" based on varied criteria like age bands or different client net worth amounts. It is widely recognized with little or no controversy that the income replacement methodology is an inferior approach to calculating client life insurance needs versus an expense-based analysis.

The best way to learn what people think is to ask them, so at their request, FPA conducted a survey of the 670 members of the FPA Research Group in November. Interestingly almost all respondents -- 99% -- expect one or more of the other crises to hit within the next decade, with 38% fearing one of those events within three years, and another 45% within five years. What they can do is help improve the chances for prosperity and help them add to their store of resiliency to cope with surprises.","Vodra, Richard E, JD, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Mar,2009

JFP,Retirement Future Tense,"Whether clients are preparing for retirement in the future or actually living in retirement now, it is, no doubt, a stressful time for them. There are two versions which characterize the spirit of this time in history for their future clients: ""Retirement Future: Tense"" and ""Retirement: Future Tense"". The differences here are more than punctuation -- the differences speak to distinct short- and long-term approaches planners can use to coach clients during these frightening financial times. Here are some thoughts to consider when working with clients in helping them create a meaningful retirement plan for the future: 1. Retirement success is more than a balance sheet. 2. Retirement can take many forms. 3. Prepare for that second, third, fourth career. Whether dealing with clients who are tense about the present state of the financial markets or working with clients planning for the new retirement, identifying personal goals that contribute to a positive sense of self and well-being are also essential.","Savage, Diane C, CFP, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8,1,9,1,0,0,6,1,6,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,9-Mar,2009

JFP,Life Insurance Options for Tough Times,"In hard economic times, investors look for ways to lighten their financial load, and life insurance has its role to play. There are four possible ways that the management of life insurance can assist in such period. First, instead of buying higher-cost permanent policies that generate cash values, many clients can stick with much lower-cost term insurance. Second, when cash value policies are acquired make sure they are low expense so clients can have immediate liquidity. Third, to save cash flow, existing permanent policies' premiums might be skipped. And finally, if investors need funds, they may be able to withdraw or borrow from cash values of permanent policies. Term insurance has no cash value. It has no liquidity component. Whole life, universal life, and variable universal life policies have cash value. But remember that no-lapse UL has low to zero cash values.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Mar,2009

Ross Levin, CFP, of Accredited Investors in Edina, MN, places his misgivings about portfolio distribution formulas on a more philosophical plane.

There are likely to be regulatory reform proposals from the new administration, and the resulting Congressional hearings may not be pretty. The public's confidence in the markets, their economic system, and ""advisors"" is greatly diminished. The pressure on politicians to fix the system is at extreme levels. The result may not be pretty. The swing of the regulatory pendulum may be extreme, confusing, and onerous. Using the Financial Planning Practice Standards as a beginning point, they could actually focus on holistic issues, whereas current regulation focuses more on transactional issues.

Respondents also provided planning strategies to prepare for and address any tax changes to keep their clients on the right path to reaching their financial goals. The survey also asked planners to forecast when specific tax proposals would be enacted: in 2009, in the next four years, or not in the foreseeable future.

They need to build arks to provide safety for three major areas of their total wealth: their financial capital, their physical capital, and their human capital. They also need to define anew what a ""safe"" investment means to them, and diversify with different risk techniques, such as hedging or insurance products.

JFP,The Next Watering Hole,"Financial planning as a discipline was born amid the financial dislocations of the early 1970s. Rearrangement of the environment, like cyclical changes across the savannah, drove advisors to new watering holes. The growth of consumer-oriented financial coverage in the media accelerated emphasis on fee-oriented services, with a percentage decrease in transaction-based revenues. The slump of 2008 will mark a historical turning point, a paradigm shift of major proportions. The influence of women is reshaping society. They note that while the industrial era valued management and engineering skills, the information era highlighted creativity and networking. Advisors seek to grow sources of revenue not tied to the vagaries of stock and bond markets. Broker/dealers and vendors can either fight the future or help entrepreneurs create it. The jolting rearrangement of Wall Street and a retreat to prudence and common sense is the best thing that has happened to independent advisors and supporting organizations in decades.","Walker, Lewis J, CFP, CIMC, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,9-Feb,2009

JFP,The Synthetic Term-Certain Annuity,"Retirees without a spouse normally choose one of two payout options from a defined-benefit plan or a private annuity: a life annuity or a life annuity with a guaranteed period. This article presents what is often a superior alternative: the synthetic term-certain annuity. A synthetic term-certain annuity is a life annuity option combined with decreasing term life insurance or a level-term policy with the value of the coverage lowered each year. This study compares the synthetic term-certain versus the traditional life annuity with a guaranteed period by comparing the cash flows of the two options on an after-tax basis. To make a valid comparison, the advisor must determine an appropriate nominal discount rate and how long the cash flows might continue. Interestingly, however, the choice of the discount rate does not noticeably change the outcomes. The study carefully notes that while the synthetic term-certain annuity is often the superior choice, higher insurance premiums can make it an inferior choice.","McCormack, Joseph P, PhD, CFA;Perdue, Grady, PhD, CFP",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Feb,2009

Life settlement arrangements allow a policy owner over age 65 who no longer needs the insurance coverage to get cash out of a policy in excess of the cash surrender value. Despite the harsh tax treatment for the life settlement provider when the insured dies, many policy holders are obtaining cash for their policies before death by selling them to life settlement providers. Although life settlements are becoming more popular, there are alternatives that may be more appealing to clients depending on their situation. Clients' needs change over time. Clients with life insurance policies that no longer serve a purpose have many choices, including surrendering, selling, viaticating, borrowing from, or exchanging the policy.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP;Covert, Neil, JD",1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,9-Feb,2009

Market volatility isn't a new phenomenon. Financial planner routinely measure clients' risk tolerance, either formally with a written questionnaire, informally through conversation, or most likely with a combination of the two discovery methods. In contacting prospective sources for this article, it quickly became apparent that advisors unanimously agree on the value of assessing clients' risk tolerance -- that's a given. Many financial advisors frame the risk-tolerance conversation with questions about possible losses. The current bear market creates both a dilemma and an opportunity for gaining a better insight into clients' risk tolerance. The dilemma stems from the possibility that risk tolerance varies with market conditions.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Feb,2009

The definition of SRI is a function of the individual's or funds viewpoint and the specific criteria they are willing to adopt. Advisors can choose from four different SRI indexes for use as benchmarks, but the indexes overlap significantly in the firms included in the indexes, so advisors must choose carefully. The average annual return for the 78 SRI funds selected for this study is 4.8% while the return on the S&amp;P 500 is 2.95% and the return on the Domini Social 400 Index is 2.0%. The authors report the overall returns for 11 individual screens used to identify specific types SRI.

JFP,Performance of Levered Closed-End Funds,"Closed-end bond and equity funds often leverage their assets by borrowing during low interest rate environments and reinvesting in securities that pay higher rates, thereby enhancing returns. The risk is that when stock or bond markets significantly decline -- as now -- levered funds will underperforrn versus unlevered closed-end funds. This paper investigates whether leverage improves the performance of closed-end funds by using the traditional measures of portfolio performance by Treynor; Sharpe; and Jensen; the M2 measure by Modigliani and Modigliani; and regression analysis. Results with the traditional measures and the M2 measure indicate that closed-end bond funds usually do not benefit. Results for closed-end equity funds are mixed, but generally do not show higher returns with the use of leverage. Regression results also do not support the use of leverage. Financial planners should be cautious in recommending closed-end funds solely on the basis of their use of leverage.","Martin, Rand, PhD;Malhotra, D K, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Feb,2009

Number one is that the client's interest -- protecting and building the client's financial security -- always comes first. The second thing he would say to all financial planners is that you can be successful only if you have healthy capital markets. Trust levels are way down on Wall Street firms, and the individual planner has to earn that trust as well. Following the demise of Enron, WorldCom, and several other corporations in 2003, many companies recognized the need to shift to the character-based insider rather than the charismatic outsider or ""corporate savior"" to build their firm.","Aschkenasy, Janet",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Feb,2009

That foundation work can be guided by the competent planner who understands that there is so much more to consider to effectively match resources with what clients want out of their labor and life.","Hughes, Bonnie A, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009
JFP,"Many Q's, Few A's","""The Financial Planning Act of 2008"" (October 2008), describing a state regulatory system specifically for the financial planning profession, elicited a number of interesting and passionate responses. The author could be a passionate advocate for a Federal system but he has little faith that Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission would get such a system in place that met all the important criteria. Other commentaries would state something like, they don't need more regulation/fiduciary duties/full disclosure; they always put their clients' interests first. There are two groups that need a distinct regulatory system specifically for the financial planning profession: clients and the financial planners who serve them. The public has an increasing demand for advice but the public is unnecessarily, and too often tragically, confused about how to go about getting advice. Confusion is pervasive largely because the SEC has allowed the bright line between sales and advice to become blurred.","Moisand, Dan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009
JFP,Flexible Estate Planning for Married Couples in an Uncertain Estate Tax Environment,"Estate planning for married couples requires more flexibility in light of changing federal estate tax exemption amounts over the next three years, and a still uncertain estate tax environment. A return to exemption amounts as low as $1 million or $2 million is not likely even under a Democratic president and Congress, though an amount falling below $3.5 million is possible, considering budget deficits. Planning for estates smaller than $1 million (including IRAs, life insurance, and retirement benefits) is relatively simple. Couples should avoid unnecessarily dividing non-community property assets between them and setting up a credit shelter trust. Medium-sized estates of $1 million to $3 million are the most challenging size of estate, requiring a case-by-case approach. Part of the challenge is not knowing where Congress will eventually place the estate tax exemption amount. Also challenging is that a recovering stock market could dramatically inflate a couple's estate value.","Blase, James G, CPA, JD, LLM",1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009

According to Salmen, regulation of the financial services industry as a whole and specifically looking at regulating financial planning as a profession are the biggest items on FPA's priority plate in 2009. On FPA's online communities of interest, Salmen said it has been successful -- in places. He added that they had more 800 members participate in the conference calls in the fall -- a pretty substantial number, even if it's a small percentage of the overall membership. On the implication of the financial crisis and recession for FPA itself, Salmen said there needs to be belt-tightening and judicious allocation of financial resources, absolutely, on a regular basis. On leadership issue, Salmen said they use the Leadership System, developed by Lynn Scoreby. It's a system for institutionalizing leadership language and process throughout the association.","Stolz, Richard F",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009

JFP,Zero-Risk Market Returns for the Ultra-Conservative Client,"Within any financial planner's client base there may be individuals who will not accept loss of principal under any investment plan. This paper presents three investment illustrations whereby the preservation of principal can be met and have an absolute gain with annual investment returns of 10%, 0%, and -10% for time horizons between 5 and 45 years. The concept is to buy zero-risk discounted US Treasury bills and invest the discount so that only the discount is at risk. When the discounted T-bill matures to face value, the total investment amount will be the face value of the T-bill plus any investment gain on the discount that had been invested in the market at the time of purchase of the T-bill. Using a discount rate of 3% and the historical market return of 10%, the results of investing between $1,000 and $5,000 annually for time horizons between 5 and 45 years show total accumulations of over $5,500 and $1,455,000, with gains over $500 and $1,230,000, respectively.","Muksian, Robert, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009
JFP,Survey of Total State Taxes and Planning Implications for Retirees,"Common wisdom states that retirees often move to sunny locations like Florida and Nevada, both of which are among seven states that have no income taxes, making them attractive to retirees. A variety of other taxes imposed by these states can add up to a hefty tax load, possibly making a state with income tax more favorable to a retiree than a state with no income tax. Changing economic conditions make state and local government tax rates fluid and subject to changes. A financial planner can provide invaluable service by matching the client's post-retirement assets, life expectancy, interests, and lifestyle to a state's total tax burden along with its amenities, and providing the client with rational decision alternatives. This paper reviews the significant components of the retiree's tax burden, and suggests broad guidelines for the client's discussion with a financial planner to maximize income during retirement years while considering family and health-related issues.","Raghavan, Kamala, DBA, CPA, CFP",1,1,8,1,9,1,0,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009
JFP,When Should Retirees Retrench? Reducing the Need with Part-Time Work and Annuitization,"Saving enough to cover living expenses at the beginning of retirement with a 4% annual withdrawal from investments is a good, sustainable goal, according to numerous studies. But what should individuals do who have to retire without adequate savings? An earlier paper developed a Retrenchment Rule to answer this question. Using this rule, most retirees will want to withdraw significantly more than 4% to avoid painful reductions in their standard of living. Doing so, however, runs an uncomfortable risk of very low withdrawals late in retirement. But withdrawing less and retrenching more initially is not cost effective. Nevertheless, most retirees will want to reduce the risk of very low withdrawals late in retirement. This strategy is to annuitize a large portion of the investment and seek part-time employment. Minimal part-time earnings provide a measurable reduction in the risk of a reduced standard of living, and maximal earnings significantly reduce the risk, as well as increase the future median value of the estate.","Pye, Gordon B, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009

JFP,Can Personal Financial Planning Save Us from Bubbles?,"You have experienced two of the largest bubbles in the history of recorded market returns, starting with a technology boom in the mid-1990s that crashed over the 2000-2002 period, followed by a real estate investment frenzy that began in the wake of the technology crash and whose recent unwinding has resulted in year-to-date losses of at least 40% for virtually every major stock index. The author has several observations about how did this happen. First, being smart does not immunize one from ""herding"" behavior. The inability to separate increasingly short-term professional horizons from long-term personal goals can lead one directly into herding behavior. So what can personal financial planning do to save you and your clients from bubbles? The key is in the financial planning process, in particular the goal-setting aspect. Your goals are yours alone, independent of any other person's goals. Logically, what others are doing to achieve their goals is not relevant to you.","Ciccotello, Conrad S, JD, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009

JFP,Long-Term Care Insurance for the High Net Worth Client,"Most financial planners agree that long-term care insurance is an essential component of any well-conceived risk management plan. While increased life expectancies over the last century have allowed many individuals to enjoy longer retirements, a consequence of increasing longevity is the greater need for more medical services, particularly at the end of life. Long-term care insurance covers the risk that individuals may need medical and custodial care, either at home or in a skilled nursing facility, at some point in their life. Long-term care insurance should be considered in most financial planning situations, regardless of the net worth of the individual and despite conventional wisdom that suggests otherwise. High net worth individuals can benefit significantly from long-term care insurance, and even clients with lower net worth who would like to retain the ability to choose the source of care could benefit from buying a long-term care policy.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Langdon, Thomas P, JD, LLM, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009

JFP,Is Markowitz Wrong? Market Turmoil Fuels Nontraditional Approaches to Managing Investment Risk,"As the US economy began to skid under the weight of the international debt crisis, talk went from buy and hold to a search for a safe harbor. And that search went wide-well beyond equities and bonds. Recent surveys show that an industrywide search for alternative investment choices was in full swing in the second half of 2008. Robert Brown, PhD, CFA, with Genworth Financial Asset Management, defines asset management as some variant on Markowitz mean variance optimization -- in other words, the contention that each asset category can be successfully characterized by an inherent, fundamental, stable set of summary statistics -- mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients. If that's the way the world works, then you can take those ingredients and you can develop a superior portfolio that over a time period will actually generate a superior result. That's the inherent premise of traditional 1990s asset allocation as practiced by the financial planning community in large measure.","Holton, Lisa",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9-Jan,2009

JFP,Joint Life Expectancy and the Retirement Distribution Period,"Past distribution research has focused primarily on determining sustainable withdrawal strategies based on fixed distribution periods, such as 30 years. While such research provides valuable information as to the likelihood of a portfolio failing over a predetermined period, it does not directly address the primary goal of retirees: to provide income for life. For most retirees, a retirement income strategy is likely to be deemed a failure only if it fails while either or both members of the retired couple is still living. Based on this logic, this paper will explore the implications of using joint life expectancy versus a fixed period when determining the appropriate initial sustainable real withdrawal rate for a distribution portfolio. Based on the research conducted for this paper, a sustainable withdrawal rate based on a joint expectancy period results in a 1%-2% higher withdrawal rate for the same probability of failure than one based on a comparable fixed period.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA;Blanchett, Brian C, CPA, CFP, AIF, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,8-Dec,2008

According to Duane Thompson, managing director of FPA's Washington office, planners are very concerned about the potential for excessive regulation with a self-regulatory organization (SRO). But if one were proposed, the survey suggests that they would prefer professional regulation by the CFP Board as financial planners, not as investment advisors under an SRO, particularly an SRO administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Nearly two-thirds (61.3%) of respondents to this survey said that they needed more information if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were to propose the creation of an SRO for federally registered investment advisers, including financial planners affiliated with such firms. Financial planners seem to want information and consistency before deciding the kind of regulator they would prefer.","Powell, Robert J, III",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Dec,2008
JFP,Market Volatility &amp; Communicating with Clients,Recent market conditions have changed the day-to-day process for many planners. Client communications have taken a much more prominent role and are consuming more time. This increase in time is due to the increased level of outgoing and incoming communications.

Over the course of the weekend, his response centered on the theme of ""control what you can control, make the best decisions you can, and everything else will sort itself out."" While people often seek technical and complicated solutions to problems, often what they need is to simply get back to the basics. What is fascinating about the responses from planners is that they are in direct conflict with their experience in working with clients. As they explain their cash management system and the philosophy behind it to clients and prospects, they are eager to finally understand their spending.

Over 15% are actually putting in more than 60 hours every single week. Clearly, the top priority for a majority of these responding financial advisers is to bring in more clients and make more money. The second largest response to the magic wand question, with over 35%, was a desire for more time off for self/family.

On whether female entrepreneurs with more moderate incomes are adequately supported and represented, Firestone said there is a middle market for women business owners of multi-million-dollar companies but not high-end revenue. On whether a woman entrepreneur faces the same obstacles as her female compatriots with different incomes, Firestone said there are various obstacles depending on the type of business and where it is located, such as whether the company is product or service or manufacturing, or locally or nationally based.

But little is known about the factors that cause the different financial consequence between genders. Financial planning services and financial planning self-help tools are available to help those preparing for divorce as they embark on legal proceedings; however, little of this advice specifically addresses interfacing financial planning and existing personal factors during the divorce process. Using US Census data from 1980 to 2000 to examine factors including age, children, education, and the presence of a significant other; researchers show that these demographics significantly affect the relative income differential of divorcees by gender. They also find that the trend in income disparity has declined somewhat over the period 1980-2000. The financial planner's role in today's environment requires a shift in client focus, a change in the content of planning information conveyed, and a greater level of awareness of the current Internal Revenue Code provisions related to divorce topics.","Hale, Kelly D;Neidermeyer, Adolph A, PhD;Pearson, Timothy A, PhD;Riley, Richard A, Jr, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Dec,2008

It's true that the economy isn't strong and their financial system is not as healthy as it needs to be, but they are incredibly far away from the types of economic difficulties seen in the depths of the 1930s.

JFP,Creating Wealth in the 'Overlooked' Defective Beneficiary Trust,"Defective irrevocable grantor trusts are a common tool for estate planners, but the income-tax defective irrevocable beneficiary trust is often overlooked or unfamiliar to estate planners. The irrevocable beneficiary defective trust treats trust property as owned by the beneficiary for income-tax purposes, but not for gift- and estate-tax purposes and, if elected, is not subject to the generation-skipping transfer tax. Therefore, for income-tax purposes, the trust income is taxed to the beneficiary instead of the trust. Advantages of the defective beneficiary trust include favorable income-tax and estate-tax treatment for the trust, ability to pass the trust's beneficiary interests to multiple generations without estate tax, and tax-free transfers between the trust and the trust's owner. One of the greatest advantages of the defective beneficiary trust is the ability of the beneficiary to shift business opportunities to the trust which can produce sizeable wealth generation inside the trust.","Hopson, James F, JD, CPA;Koehn, Jo Lynne, PhD, CPA, CFP;Hopson, Patricia D, CPA",0,0,10,1,10,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Dec,2008

This article also explores the implications of this research and how it applies to you and your practice. A survey was e-mailed to 38,810 financial planners who are members of the CFP Board and/or the Financial Planning Association. Because some financial planners do not have direct contact with clients and because some planners may view their role as ""purely"" financial planning, researchers asked respondents if they ever engage in non-financial coaching and counseling. Of the 1726 planners who answered the question, 1540 (89%) answered yes and 186 (11%) answered no. They were astonished at the array of human frailties emerging in the client-planner relationship. Suicide (10%), therapy (7%-9%), and drugs (3%-5%) are issues that their respondents encountered.

JFP,Estate Planning and the 2009 Increase in Exemptions and Exclusions,"By the time this column is published, people will be getting ready not only for the inauguration of a new president but also for a significant change in the transfer tax system: the scheduled 2009 increase in the estate tax exclusion and the generation-skipping tax exemption to $3.5 million, as well as the increase in the present interest annual exclusion to $13,000. Given the potential significant revenue loss from an estate tax repeal and the current financial crisis, it appears highly unlikely that Congress will allow the scheduled estate tax repeal to occur in 2010. Estate planners routinely advise clients to view their estate plans as works in progress and to review and possibly revise those plans on a periodic basis. Next year's scheduled increase in the estate tax exclusion and the generation-skipping tax exemption makes such a review more important than ever before.","Gallo, Jon J, JD",0,0,7,1,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Dec,2008

McCabe said there three major nots of old age stand in the way of this conversation. These nots that parents of baby boomers hold onto like a life raft are 1. They are not losing control. 2. They are not sharing their private business with anyone. 3. They are not going to be a burden on their children. This stubborn determination to not be a burden sometimes causes the greatest burdens, Financial planners have a unique role to play in alleviating the stresses aging parents unwittingly place on their adult children. Planners can best help clients deal with parental care through a four-step process. First, initiate the conversation between children and parents. Second, if the parents are willing to look at alternative living arrangements, help them find the best facilities. Third, help your clients with their parents' financial problems.","Grote, Jim, CFP;Rogé, Rosanne, CFP, CSA, RFG",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Dec,2008

JFP,Living with the Cost of Dying,"While many seem to connect the amount of life insurance with the estate value to provide liquidity, it really is a more subtle process. The author believes there are three major reasons to consider life insurance associated with estate planning: 1. liquidity, 2. wealth transfer, and 3. inheritance equalization. Life insurance premiums for estate planning purposes are primarily transferred to irrevocable life insurance trusts via gifts. Adding up estate assets and recommending life insurance in half this amount doesn't get the job done. Estate planning life insurance should make the not-so-subtle distinctions of what types of assets are involved and what people planning issues can be handled. A good test of whether life insurance is a good fit is if the available cash flow can easily handle the premium payments with a well thought out gifting program.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Nov,2008

That said, you can look to adjustable rate products as being the most closely scrutinized for the obvious reason of payment increase. Reverse mortgages are here to stay. They are, if used properly, an effective tool for senior citizens to tap their home equity. But with new products comes the opportunity for fraud. Safeguards must be put in place to prevent predatory lending on our senior citizens.

When the author considers the important innovations in the profession, most have not resulted from investment or insurance product development, or a software 'killer app:' Most of the important innovations have centered on efficiency of operations or the improvement of financial planners' skill in helping clients modify or manage their own behavior. But when most innovations are introduced, the potential benefits are pretty much speculative. The problem was either in the motivations that drove them; the failure to consider the possible negative outcomes; or the failure to ""play the movie forward,"" anticipating the problems, complexities, or impracticalities that were likely to occur.

Here are some of those paradigms that might operate while engaged in a retirement planning discussion: 1. Your clients share the same planning priorities as you do. 2. The primary goal for a retirement planner is to achieve maximum financial security for the client. 3. Successful retirement means sustaining high income replacement ratios throughout retirement. 4.

JFP,The Hedonic Pleasure Index(TM): An Enhanced Model for Spending Inflation,"This paper challenges the accepted use of the Consumer Price Index as the benchmark for spending inflation in simulation software and safe-initial-withdrawal studies. The author deconstructs CPI-U to explain why the price index is a poor measure of spending inflation and proposes an alternative measure (the Hedonic Pleasure Index) based on individual consumption growth. This paper uses data from the Bureau of Economic Affairs Personal Consumption Expenditures from 1929 through 2006 and the Bureau of Labor Statistics annual Consumer Expenditure Surveys from 1984 through 2005. Simulation results using real consumption growth of 55 basis points during retirement required an additional 7.55 savings, which in turn reduced the safe initial withdrawal rate threshold by 30 basis points. The paper concludes that inflation assumptions in simulation software should focus on client consumption behavior not government price indexes.","Shambo, James A, CPA/PFS",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Nov,2008

JFP,When Does a Bonds-First Withdrawal Sequence Extend Portfolio Longevity?,"This paper explores the effect of the withdrawal sequencing decision on the longevity of retirees' portfolios by comparing the strategy of consuming bond assets first with two other strategies: consuming stocks first, and maintaining a 50/50 stock/bond portfolio. The authors find that consuming bonds first extends investor portfolios 90% of the time over the other methods. However investors who consume bonds first transition to the riskiest portfolios, with significantly higher annual volatility than the alternative strategies. The current spread of stocks' long-term earnings yield over bond yields is less than 1%, indicating that the expected return on US stocks and the equity risk premium are near historical lows. The signal indicates that for retirees in 2008, taking on the increased volatility of the bonds-first strategy is not worth it as the strategy is unlikely to result in the same extension of portfolio longevity as it has historically.","Weigand, Robert A, PhD;Irons, Robert",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Nov,2008
JFP,Becoming Consumers of the Profession We Practice,"This article discusses why few planners are planner-clients, the personal and professional benefits of being a planner-client and how to select your own planner. Planners' reasons for not hiring their own financial planners are largely the same as any prospective clients. Even the most common objection from planners -- why should they pay someone else to do something they can do -- echoes the objection of many prospective clients. Perhaps most surprising for planners who have become planner-clients are the professional benefits they realize. These include increased understanding of the client experience, deepened ability to communicate the value of financial planning, experiencing another planner's processes, and creating new ideas for one's own practice. Selecting a planner should entail more than simply choosing a colleague the planner has known and trusted for years. Interview at least three planners and discuss investment philosophy, agree how to manage investments and implementation, discuss concerns about disclosure, value, and trust, and agree on fees and payment.","Kahler, Richard S, CFP, ChFC, CCIM",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,6,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Nov,2008

Karmin said that he started at the Journal in 1999, covering the overseas stock markets, with the dollar as a secondary beat. In 2004, when the dollar started to fall more rapidly in the second half of the year, his editors asked him to focus on it. He did a lot of thinking about the special status the dollar has in most people's lives and wondering if that status was in jeopardy. He added that the dollar's decline during the last seven years has been orderly and slow and there are significant positive benefits from a weaker dollar -- it has helped exporters, it helped slow and reduce the trade deficit, and it's been a huge boon for foreign tourists in the US.","Lee, Shelley A",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Oct,2008

The challenge is that standardization does not yet exist within the profession to incorporate valid and reliable measures of risk tolerance, risk capacity, and time horizon.

For May, the federal Section 7520 rate was 3.2%, down from 5.6% one year ago, though for July and August the rate climbed to 4.2%. Several estate planning strategies provide benefits in their current low interest rate environment, as well as some that should be avoided. In funding a grantor retained annuity trust (GRATs), it is best to use property that is expected to appreciate at a rate greater than the Section 7520 rate. Intentionally defective grantor trusts (IDGTs) are also advantageous in this low-rate environment. IDGTs are trusts designed to intentionally tax the income to the grantor instead of the trust because of the compressed tax rates applicable to trusts. Charitable remainder annuity trusts (CRATs) are also similar to GRATS, except with a CRAT the remainder interest passes to charity. The annuity has to exceed 5%, and a 10% interest in the assets has to pass to the charity.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP;Daff, Leslie, JD",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,8-Oct,2008

Financial services have learned a top-down method of identifying a client's behavioral investor type. By learning this process and applying it before creating an investment plan for a client, the client is more likely to be able to adhere to a plan that is custom designed for them and, when this happens, financial advisors build stronger relationships with their clients. As a final note, advisors should realize that clients will have stronger or weaker forms of the behavioral investor types presented here based on the number and severity of the biases that are associated with each behavioral investor type.","Pompian, Michael M, CFP, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Oct,2008

To stimulate debate over a state licensing approach, the article provides a sample state bill that establishes a state board to license and regulate financial planners. The bill is a blending of a number of state statutes and proposed statutes for varying occupations.

Although particular categories of personal trauma may demand crisis-specific counsel and client interaction techniques, general principles apply to many situations, planners say.

JFP,When Should Retirees Retrench? Later Than You Think,"Saving enough to sustain a given standard of living with a 4% annual withdrawal from investments is a good goal. Studies show that such a withdrawal has good sustainability. Many people, however have to retire well before accumulating enough assets to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living at this sustainable 4% rate. This paper develops a Retrenchment Rule to determine when retirees should reduce their standard of living, and by how much. This rule depends on a discount rate. The surprising finding of this paper is that much of the retrenchment should be deferred, rather than implemented right away. Using the Retrenchment Rule with an 8% discount rate, retirees should withdraw significantly more than 4% to avoid painful retrenchment.","Pye, Gordon B, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Sep,2008
JFP,Creating a Comfortable Homestretch,"Your client has finally made it to the homestretch; they are within a few years of retirement and are ready to celebrate. You, their trusted financial advisor, know differently. This is just the beginning. Now you need to make sure your retiring client's nest egg is ready to carry them through the real homestretch: the next 20 to 40 years. The authors are exploring the benefits of converting a traditional IRA (tax-deferred withdrawals) to a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) with many of their clients. By no means is this a cutting-edge planning idea, but it has renewed relevance due to the tax landscape and the elimination of the adjusted gross income limit. Although many factors will influence your decision-making, one factor that should take a front seat is retirement plan contributions and distribution strategies. Hopefully these suggestions will help you advise your clients down the pivotal homestretch.","Supper, William J, CFP;Cocozza, Christopher R, CPA, JD, LLM",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,8-Sep,2008

These changes may provide one of the most significant investment opportunities of the past half-century. Consider that hundreds of millions of people around the world suddenly have something they have never had before: discretionary income. Countries whose combined populations dwarf that of the US are experiencing unprecedented growth, prosperity, and economic clout. An almost unimaginable amount of money will be spent in new places and all this spending will stimulate new markets and new investment opportunities. Investors who fail to recognize the economic and financial market decoupling that is occurring may miss an important opportunity.

On a macro level, the release of the RAND report and the Treasury ""blueprint"" have kept the issue of the regulatory elements of accountability on the minds of the financial services industry participants. Almost every planner the author knows can recite a number of cases in which another advisor put a client into something in a way that complied with regulations but, when viewed from a financial planning perspective, was simply wrong. The code of ethics and practice standards represent a filter for determining the acceptability of planning services. Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems with offering the marks as the solution to the regulatory gaps. While the CFP Board has had a lot to deal with in recent years, people need to keep asking the board of directors for clarity, and CFP Board can do a better job of soliciting practitioner viewpoints and engaging in real dialogue.","Moisand, Dan, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Sep,2008

JFP,Benefits and Management of Inflation-Protected Treasury Bonds,"Treasury bond funds vaulted to the top of the fixed-income category in 2007 and smartly outperformed the US equity markets. Inflation-protected Treasury bond funds (TIPS) did even better returning almost 12% for the year. These returns reflect a decline in interest rates and, for TIPS, underforecasted inflation. TIPS had been expected to be less volatile than conventional Treasury bonds, but the record does not support this. Because the returns and volatilities of TIPS are likely to be comparable with those of conventional Treasury bonds over long periods, portfolios should generally contain substantial proportions of each. Individual TIPS provide a variable cash flow because the inflation adjustment is not paid until maturity or sale. A ladder manages this variation, Buying at the original auction eliminates tax amortization issues. Individuals should generally locate TIPS inside a pension or IRA for tax efficiency. This location also eliminates tax complications caused by amortization and inflation adjustments.","Lingane, Peter Jane, EA, CFP",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Sep,2008

JFP,Why You Are Not a Good Comprehensive Financial Planner,"Estate planning is an area that most CFP practitioners recognize is fraught with issues. For practitioners, the biggest issue is the recognition that, unless you are an attorney, you have to be very careful not to practice law. Of all the areas planners tend to bail on, property and casualty insurance is probably the most popular because, as a topic of interest, it is probably the least popular. The fact of the matter, though, is that property, casualty, and liability insurance mistakes can destroy a financial plan that is otherwise exemplary. Sometimes these issues aren't mistakes as much as they are oversights or failures to monitor changes in the client's situation. Smaller organizations typically overlook the need for coverage or can't afford it on their meager budgets. If you know, or have reason to suspect, that your client is on such a board, you should ask if he or she is properly covered.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Shein, Jay, CFP, CIMA, CIS",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Sep,2008

JFP,Asset Minimums and How Planners Get Paid,"Rare is the planner who will be in business for an extended period of time if they charge $1,000 in fees when it costs them $2,000 to deliver services to a client. In their marketing material, financial planners typically state some sort of a minimum asset level for prospective clients. Earlier this year, Cerulli Associates (CA) surveyed FPA planners about asset minimums and discovered some interesting things. More than 80% of advisers require clients to have at least $100,000 in investable assets before a financial planning engagement becomes a realistic outcome, and more than 50% set the minimum asset level in excess of $500,000. Despite the varying degrees of complexity involved in planning engagements, a surprisingly high number (37%) of advisers use set fees for plans, and a nearly equal amount do not charge for plans at all, instead considering them a value-added part of their client relationships.","Powell, Robert J, III",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Sep,2008

JFP,Data Dependence and Sustainable Real Withdrawal Rates,"Past research on sustainable real withdrawal rates has been overwhelmingly based on past market returns. Such research ignores the possibility, and consequently the implications, that future market conditions will vary from those in the past. This paper will explore the impact of varying returns and standard deviations on a distribution portfolio in order to provide the reader with information on appropriate sustainable real withdrawal rates for various market conditions. Experts predict that the future market return for a balanced 60/40 portfolio is likely to be 1%-2% less than historical averages. Over longer distribution periods the return of a portfolio becomes increasingly important in maintaining the likelihood of success of a distribution portfolio. A 1% decrease in portfolio return is likely to result in an increase in the probability of failure that is approximately 4 times greater than a 1% increase in portfolio standard deviation.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA;Blanchett, Brian C, CPA, CFP, AIF",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,8-Sep,2008

JFP,Life Expectancy: What's the Right Number?,"Every reader of this article has probably, at one point or another, asked their clients some variation of the ""what's your time horizon"" question. This question gets trickier as clients get older. For the near- or in-retirement investor, the advisor must consider the life expectancy of the client. This question pushes the advisor out of the comfort zone of investments and into the waiting arms of the actuarial sciences. Avoidance is not an option, as the many ubiquitous calculators that advisors use to help with retirement planning all tend to require an input to this question. So what's the right number? To answer that, it's important to understand a few aspects of life expectancy. These are: 1. Headline life expectancy isn't relevant. 2. Your clients aren't average. 3. It's getting better all the time.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Aug,2008

JFP,Income-Harvesting Strategy: Achieving Inflation-Adjusted Income from a Lump-Sum Asset,"There are currently several strategies available to produce retirement income from a lump-sum asset. Some of the strategies compared with the income-harvesting approach introduced in this article include systematic withdrawals, guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits associated with variable annuities, and time-segmented withdrawal strategies. To build a new strategy, it was necessary to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the current income strategies. In developing new ideas for income distribution it is possible to implement a strategy that allows a client to harvest gains achieved from the equity markets and use them as income later in the plan. Income harvesting takes the focus away from expected returns and places an emphasis on the volatility of the equity markets. To accomplish this, the authors created four investment accounts which are: 1. income guarantee account, 2. equity withdrawal account, 3. equity harvest account, and 4. the derivative protection account.","Parker, Zachary S, CFP, LUTCF",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Aug,2008

And still, the client is thinking about moving his account. As the author thinks about this, there are several observations that are relevant for all of their practices. These include: 1. Do not become too dependent on any one client. 2. Examine whether it's worth it. 3. Remember that people are watching. 4. Understand that sometimes it is not about you. 5. Understand that sometimes it is about you. 6. Remember that you can win by losing. 7. Understand that experience always has a price. 8.

JFP,Guiding Clients Through the Mortgage Mess,"Although mortgages are grabbing headlines, as more financial advisors have moved to an assets-wider-management model, there is a risk that clients' mortgages will receive less attention than under a traditional financial planning model. That's not to imply that advisors overlook mortgages and debt management-many cover those areas with every client. But advising on mortgages doesn't pay the bills. The shift toward focusing exclusively on wealthier clients also changes the practice of advising on mortgages. Those clients usually have sufficient assets to avoid the problems cropping up for lower- and middle-income homeowners. They also receive professional advice on debt-funding options and avoiding excessive borrowing. Wealthy clients aren't immune from the current crisis, of course, as evidenced by problems in the jumbo loan market. Frequently, however, mortgages and other debts have a less prominent role in these clients' finances than they do for the less affluent.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,1,7,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Aug,2008

JFP,Unintended Consequences: When Good Estate Plans Cause Bad Problems,"The law of unintended consequences says that actions often have unanticipated effects. Adam Smith was talking about the law of unintended consequences when he observed that the public interest is served when each of you, seeking only your own gain, is led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. In his iconic 1936 article, ""The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action,"" sociologist Robert K. Merton identified the five sources of unanticipated consequences. He called the third source ""the imperious immediacy of interest,"" which refers to situations where the intended consequences are so important that you overlook unintended but reasonably foreseeable effects. This article focuses on the application of the effect of imperious immediacy of interest on estate planning.

The impact of RMDs is analyzed in two distinct ways: using fixed rates of return on a tax-deferred portfolio and using rates of return that incorporate real-world variability. The paper also investigates four coping strategies and their models, and the results from both the fixed and the random models are presented. One of the coping strategies is to reinvest any excess RMD withdrawal into a brokerage account. The paper finds that this practice results in the same runout frequency that would occur in the absence of RMDs.","Spitzer, John J, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Aug,2008

JFP,"Transcending the Strategies, Tactics, and Tools of Financial Planning","The oft-quoted French adage, ""The more things change, the more they stay the same,"" seems to me so descriptive of the current state of affairs in the financial planning industry. Evidence abounds that the industry keeps its focus glued to the strategies, tactics, and tools of financial planning. It's the specific solutions, tactics, and tools used in the financial planning process, all of which any prudent life planner would say are subordinate to the client's mission, vision, goals, and values. You have a world focused on implementing specific strategies. There instead needs to be careful crafting of an over-arching strategy for decisions about the products and techniques that are part of the financial planning engagement. This article explores this distinction between financial planning strategies, tactics, and tools, and the mission, vision, values, and goals -- the strategic nature of the life planning relationship.","Jones, Michael L, ChFC, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Aug,2008
JFP,Dallas Salisbury on How Planners Can Serve the Average Worker's Needs,"In an interview, Dallas L. Salisbury, CEO of the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, talked about how financial planners can serve the average worker's needs. On the role of employers and financial planners in motivating Americans to save adequately for retirement, Salisbury said the employer's role is largely a role of facilitation. The financial advisor is able to do a fairly thorough assessment of differential decision-making for a level of assets and ultimately income, on top of Social Security, that will meet their individual needs. On how financial planners can better serve the public interest, Salisbury said planners can do pro bono work in low. income communities or in schools. And whether that means going to those places or making yourself available on the phone, this is the type of help that people at the low end of the scale desperately need.","Stolz, Richard F",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Aug,2008
JFP,"Dave Strege on the Real Mission of CFP Board, Misperceptions, and Facts","In an interview, Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc chair and board of directors Dave Strege talked about what it all means and where CFP Board goes from here. He said they still need to understand and define what segments of the public can benefit from working with a CFP practitioner. CFP Board is launching an analysis of the need for financial planning among the public and the identification of those segments that can benefit from the services of CFP certificants. Their mission is to benefit the public by upholding the CFP certification as the standard of excellence for personal financial planning. On how he would describe the current relationship between CFP Board and the Financial Planning Association, he said it's improving and that also is part of his mission. The issue of communication is probably his biggest frustration. It certainly relates to the much-discussed resignation of five members of the Disciplinary and Ethics Commission.","Lee, Shelley A",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jul,2008

One point should be very clear. Without realizing it at the time, the relationships created with people over these years had a huge impact with very positive results. In 2002 he had a total hip replacement.

JFP,Draining the Swamp,"The recent flap over the disciplinary process at CFP Board has captured the attention of various media writers, leaving certificants wondering on what's going on again. The author's purpose is not to defend anyone or pick sides in this most recent incident. His hope is that if he can provide you with more of a historical perspective, you can gain a better sense of how really good people serving the profession can have wildly divergent world views. One of the biggest issues facing the current board of directors and CFP Board staff is sorting through the issue on why CFP Board keeps doing goofy things, both legally and culturally -- for the long term. Most issues that are communicated by CFP Board chairs are way more complicated than what can easily be explained in a memo -- both from a legal and compassion perspective.","Adkins, Rick, CFP, ChFC, CLU",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jul,2008

JFP,Thinking About a Roth 401(k)? Think Again,"The choice whether to contribute to a regular 401(k) or a Roth 401(k) combines simple arithmetic with difficult projections of future tax rates. This article will show that the answer to the question on what the client's tax rate will be in retirement is often not what is commonly believed. The article addresses the specific case of the affluent wage earner client, and shows in an easy-to-grasp way why future effective tax rates for this group are unlikely to rise by much. Most affluent wage earners who are not truly wealthy can reasonably project effective future tax rates lower than their current marginal rates and hence should favor regular 401(k) accounts over Roth accounts. Financial planners are responsible for understanding the benefits and costs of each type of retirement account, and recommending the one most appropriate to the client at hand. Financial planners have an opportunity to add value by assisting with this choice.","McQuarrie, Edward F, PhD",0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jul,2008

JFP,Financial Planning for Clients Considering a Continuing Care Retirement Community,"Facing increasing life expectancies, many clients will explore the possibility of living in a continuing care retirement community (CCRC). The financial advisor can provide insight on the financial implications of this decision. CCRCS provide three levels of care: independent living, assisted living, and skilled nursing care, and the ability to move from one level to the next. If clients express an interest in CCRCs, they should check immediately to see if there is a waiting list. Some can be very long. Pre-planning is vital for CCRCs. Amenities, from swimming pools to meal plans, vary dramatically from facility to facility, and CCRCs bundle such amenities differently. Funding the sometimes steep entrance fees takes careful planning and timing. Tax considerations are also important. Financial advisors can help clients estimate the potential need for higher levels of care in order to determine what type of CCRC facility to enter.","Mayes, Sarah L, CPA;Nelms, Linda L, CPA, CMA",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jul,2008

JFP,VUL Policies Work with Astute Management,"Variable universal life (VUL) allows policyholders to control how their policies' premiums are invested by selecting from various mutual funds available. Most VUL buyers select equity funds. In contrast to VUL, whole life and universal life policy premiums are mostly invested by the insurance company in investment-grade bonds held for yield. Therefore, investment results for whole life and universal life will change relatively slowly and are backed by a minimum guarantee, which means the cash values can never take a loss. By far the largest problems with VUL involve policies with level death benefits. It is impossible to know how much and the timing of premiums with such investment volatility. Variable universal life policies are a bit like diabetes. Real problems are likely to occur if left unattended, but with wise management, both can be nicely handled.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jul,2008
JFP,Reaching Out to the Next Generation: Educating Your Clients' Children,"The New Retirement Mindscape, a comprehensive study of retirement attitudes by Ameriprise Financial, in conjunction with Age Wave and Ken Dychtwald and Harris Interactive, illuminates a retirement planning need: educating children about money. Amazingly, for 52% of the survey respondents, the top priority is not investment management plans or estate planning strategies, but simple instruction and advice to help their children become more financially savvy. Reaching out to educate your clients' children not only satisfies your clients, but presents a way for you to establish relationships with the next generation. When it comes to educating clients' children about money management, Patrick Dougherty, CFP, of Dougherty Financial Services in Dallas, TX, says many of his clients miss a golden opportunity because they don't encourage their children to get a job. With the long-term, big picture as a foundation, Dougherty uses the college planning process as a vehicle for financial education.","Opiela, Nancy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jul,2008
JFP,The Three-Legged Stool Redux,"Financial planners might be able to bring back the time-honored three-legged stool which had been, until recently, the traditional sources-of-income model for retirement. The three-legged stool model has been shelved and replaced with the four-legged chair model to accommodate the role of work as a part of the traditional retirement income sources that include pensions. While baby boomers are more disposed to this expanded definition, many still hold onto vestiges of the old retirement model. Even though many of the baby boomers have enjoyed the advantage of an education, white collar jobs, and life in suburbia, this lifestyle may have come at a high price on the Maslow hierarchy. One approach to prepare clients for their retirement futures is to broaden their perspective about the retirement plan by incorporating the revised three-legged stool model as a way to describe the philosophical underpinnings of retirement preparation. The plan needs to reflect three important qualities: it must be grounded, resilient, and nimble.","Savage, Diane C, CFP, CRC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8-Jul,2008
JFP,Determining the Proper Starting Balance for Taxable and Tax-Deferred Savings at Retirement,"General, investment savings consist of both taxable and tax-deferred savings, each of which has unique taxing characteristics, and there is an optimum allocation between taxable and tax-deferred savings at the start of retirement. The optimum taxable and tax-deferred savings allocation at the start of retirement is defined as an allocation that will result in maximizing the retirement savings in the year before the year in which the required minimum distributions exceed the required use-of-savings, termed the ERMD-YR. The theoretical optimal savings allocation is that initial allocation in which the starting taxable savings are depleted in the ERMD-YR and minimal use of retirement savings is required before the ERMD-YR. In the five to ten years before retirement, the allocation decision for contributions between taxable and tax-deferred savings should be based on the optimum target allocation at the start of retirement.","Bernacchi, Ben T, CFP",2,1,10,1,12,1,1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jul,2008

This article is designed to help financial advisors thoroughly understand the mechanics of the HECM, compare it with other retirement options such as a home equity line of credit, and determine if the HECM should be considered as a component within a client's long-term financial plan. This article provides an in-depth review of the main formulas and variables that make up the HECM. Through a series of cash-flow illustrations, it presents the costs and benefits of using various home-equity based strategies to increase cash flow in retirement.

JFP,Beyond the Red Zone: Retirement and Long-Term Care Planning,"Three words that have generated intense interest in the financial planning community over the past decade are retirement, baby, and boomers. The tip of the baby boomer iceberg is approaching retirement age, and in spite of a series of infamous financial debacles, the iceberg is still afloat. In a prominent advertising campaign, Prudential has referred to the period five years before and five years after retirement as the Red Zone. For a context of the post-Red Zone discussion, it is useful to revisit some of the economic theory behind retirement planning. As any financial planner knows, long-term care insurance typically provides a flat monthly, weekly, or daily supplement amount when the insured becomes unable to perform two or more of the activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing, using the bathroom, or getting out of bed -- the equivalent of losing household productivity. For planners, setting realistic expectations in the client's accumulation phase can prevent a decline in lifestyle as clients age.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Lemoine, Craig, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,5,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-May,2008

JFP,Rules of the Road,"The financial planning profession and the financial services industry may find themselves thinking about regulations now that the Rand report is out. The author believes financial planning should be regulated separately from its subsets. The best way to implement distinct regulation is in one of two ways: either a national professional regulatory organization (PRO) or a state licensing regimen similar to that of accountancy. People need good regulation of financial planning in the US because the current system doesn't work very well for the public or practitioners. It takes four main things to get this right and form a piece of good public policy: 1. License people to practice. 2. Require specific behavior. 3. Strengthen enforcement. 4. Resolve disputes.

The first part introduces advisors to the current state of academic research on the subject. The second part provides a context for evaluating a variable annuity with a popular guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) rider if such a product had been available for purchase before two historical ""worst case"" market scenarios. A primary finding is that, while the conditions required to cause insurance companies to pay claims under lifetime income benefit riders are rare, carriers do appear to carry real claims risk. Given the potential of variable annuity contracts with living benefit riders to address the single biggest concern of most retirees -- lifetime income sustainability -- the importance of improving disclosure, eliminating conflict of interest, and banishing unethical sales practices cannot be understated.","Robinson, John H",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-May,2008

When they develop a retirement plan for their clients, they keep their eyes on the major items such as systematic contributions to savings vehicles, asset allocation, and asset withdrawal strategies. Yet they tend to overlook the little items that can help them achieve a more satisfying retirement. Health savings accounts (HSAs) were introduced to the tax system to make health care more affordable to the average family. HSAs enable a taxpayer to pay for current health care expenditures and to save for future expenses on a tax-free basis. When advising clients, many planners fall into the trap of focusing solely on the big picture. As in life, financial planning can be much more successful if appropriate attention is paid to the little things.","Supper, William J, CFP;Cocozza, Christopher R, CPA, JD, LLM",0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,8-May,2008
JFP,When It's Time to Move On,"If good personal financial planning is the antidote to a chaotic or unintended financial result for individuals and families, then exit planning for a client's existing business has to be the solution to maximizing the value of the firm and delivering on any other goals the owner is able to articulate. The process for an exit plan looks a lot like the process for a financial plan. First, you gather data. Second, analyze the data. Third, develop an action plan that shows tasks, responsibilities, and a timeline. Finally, guide your business-owner client in the implementation of that action plan.

Donald Duncan, CFP, CPA/PFS, CFA, of D3 Financial Counselors in Downers Grove, IL, says that business owners still committed to providing health insurance for their employees often feel as if they are choosing between the lesser of two evils. The general thinking is that although the health insurance system may be dismantled and revised over the course of the next several years, its likely that employers will still end up paying one way or the other. For that reason, business owners are eager to participate in the process and be an active part of any future solution -- and there's plenty planners can do to help.","Opiela, Nancy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-May,2008

One of their roles is to help associates of MetLife understand who the 50-plus market is. This year is a big ""legislative"" birthday for a slice of the boomer generation -- the first ones turn 62 in 2008 and are eligible for Social Security benefits. They're moving into the traditional retirement transition period, so they're beginning to think much more seriously about their future. She believes they do feel relatively financially stable because of their corporate retirement plans, the fact they're going to grab Social Security before it possibly becomes insolvent, and their net worth. This leading edge boomer group is not wealthy, but they do have resources.

JFP,Leveraged ETFs: A Risky Double That Doesn't Multiply by Two,"This study investigates the long-run return properties of leveraged ""ultra-bullish"" exchange traded funds (ETFs), which seek to multiply the daily performance of market indexes both on the long and short side. Although leveraged ETFs can multiply index returns by a specific amount on a day-to-day basis, long-run returns cannot similarly be multiplied by the leverage ratio due to the constant leverage trap and the lognormal nature of continuously compounded returns. Using Monte Carlo simulation, it is found that a typical 2x leveraged stock ETF is likely to only magnify the index return by 1.4 times on an annual basis for holding periods out to ten years. The paper also compares leveraged ETFs with buying an index fund using a simple margin account. It finds the leveraged ETFs a superior long-term alternative due to their relative lower cost. Given the risk/return trade-off leveraged ETFs offer, long-term investors should be considerably wary. Extreme swings in value are inherent in this type of fund.","Trainor, William J, Jr, PhD, CFA;Baryla, Edward A, Jr, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-May,2008

Factors unrelated to expected performance may be the real story behind the tendency to overweight locally. As it turns out, this is a relevant issue not only for individual investors, but institutional investors as well. Coval and Moskowitz (2001) constructed a dataset that matched the holdings of individual actively managed equity funds with the distance from the headquarters of those companies to the fund's location. So while it is intriguing that 35,000 households were, on average, able to achieve some success by overweighting local firms in their portfolios, there's still room at the table for the concept of ""too much of a good thing can be dangerous."" If clients want to execute small ""local"" tilts in their equity portfolios, that's terrific.

A significant deal of information technology is incorporated in financial planning software. Financial planning software can be considered a financial planning information system (FPIS). An FPIS needs to provide for controls and audits to ensure data security and integrity. These new tools will provide better support for a financial planner's work, including his or her fiduciary responsibilities.

Investment policies should account for these actual investor practices. In this article, investment policies are tailored to the changing nature of risk and return across three intended holding periods: one year, one to five years, and five years and longer. This article discusses methods for modeling risk. For very long investment periods, including across multiple generations, the investment policy needs to attempt to maximize and protect net worth positions and lifetime consumption. Asset allocation becomes more flexible and capital gains become more critical. By viewing the relevant economic choices to involve consumption today versus consumption tomorrow, investment policies can expand considerably beyond the traditional and more limited trade-off of pricing volatility versus pricing return.","Kaufhold, Kevin C, JD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Apr,2008

JFP,Will Future Equity Risk Premium Decline?,"Financial experts differ regarding the future equity risk premium (ERR) of common stocks versus the ERP of the past, suggesting that ERP may be less useful as a guide in future asset allocations. This paper compares the broad macroeconomic factors that shaped the ERP in the pre-World War II US economy with newer ERP factors to determine if there is a structural shift in the long-run ERP. The paper examines the behavior of the historical equity risk premium for 1870-2002 using the returns on the S&amp;P 500 Index and the ten-year Treasury bond. The changing explanatory power of these factors is tested in the regression model, which supports the contention that the ERP tends to decline in maturing economies. Growth and globalization in the world economy also have likely influenced the declining role of ERP, though the highest risk/return opportunities will continue to come from emerging markets and high-growth maturing markets.","Devaney, Michael, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Apr,2008

JFP,Incentive Trusts and Foreclosure: When Incentives Become Disincentives,"In the words of Marjorie Stephens, author of ""Incentive Trusts: Considerations, Uses and Alternatives,"" incentive trusts are trusts by which clients seeking to control behavior use money to provide incentives for what the client views as ""productive behavior"" and to penalize what the client sees as ""nonproductive behavior."" Incentive trusts sometimes take innovative, if not amusing, forms. To understand why incentive trusts can have a potentially adverse psychological impact on the beneficiaries, you need to understand how you develop your identity, your sense of self. Perhaps the most important falling of incentive trusts is the failure to distinguish between internal and external motivation. Most incentive trusts are drafted from the viewpoint of the goals the client wishes the beneficiaries to achieve. In the author's opinion, a better approach for parents concerned about their children is ask them to think about what would be in their best interests.","Gallo, Eileen, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Apr,2008
JFP,Standing Out from the Competition,"A basic tenet of marketing is to avoid ""me-too"" products and services. Research shows that top-performing businesses gain a competitive advantage by clearly differentiating themselves in a way that their customers value. Firms that lack differentiation are less successful as measured by a variety of metrics. Advisory firms across the size spectrum and with a range of business models and markets are finding ways to stand out from the competition. Some are achieving their success in smaller, less competitive markets, but others operate in major urban areas. There are numerous options for creating differentiation, but apart from the intangible qualities of personal relationships with clients, it's hard for small and mid-size firms to create sustainable competitive advantages. Developing superior advisory expertise is one possibility, but that assumes the firm can maintain that edge over time. Firms that have differentiated themselves will stand out from competitors. How a firm accomplishes that will depend on the opportunities that present themselves and the firm's ability to exploit those opportunities.","McCarthy, Ed, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Apr,2008

In this article, the authors address the unique financial and estate planning issues faced by gay men, lesbians, and same-sex couples, and how to work with this underserved niche market. Before sitting down with gay and lesbian clients, advisors should make an effort to ensure that they are prepared to work with the gay and lesbian community. Aside from engendering trust, it is extremely important for advisors to think about how they present themselves and the information they provide to gay and lesbian clients.

Contracts will continue to be important and necessary documents in their practices. They are unavoidable from a legal, regulatory, practical, and E&amp;O insurance perspective.

She defines middle America as individuals who fall somewhere between the broad definitions of poverty and semi-affluent -- it's about 86% of all Americans.

Since he is solicited by clients and not the other way around, he takes on what is brought to him. The market for the buying and selling of life insurance policies for investment purposes had a rational basis in the beginning. Almost all other possible life settlement situations should result in the policyowner retaining the policy -- at least until the policy is near termination. The life settlement industry and their solicitors have created the image that many policy owners often come to the rational conclusion they want to sell their life insurance policies and then contact an agent. The appetite for doing life settlement transactions has become so great that the industry has convinced itself that life insurance is so mispriced that the policies of insureds in the same health are attractive targets as well.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Mar,2008
JFP,Economics' Approach to Financial Planning,"This article briefly describes economics' approach to financial planning and contrasts it with conventional planning. Economics' approach is based on consumption smoothing -- the proposition that households seek to spread their spending power over time as well as across times -- times that are good and bad. In simple situations featuring no uncertainty and no limitations on borrowing, consumption-smoothing, life-cycle spending plans can be calculated using high school algebra. Otherwise their solution requires dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is particularly useful for dealing with borrowing constraints -- the inability of households to fully smooth their living standards without borrowing more money than is feasible or desired. The dynamic programming used to smooth a household's living standard delivers a lifetime spending plan. When retirement spending targets are set too high, households are told to save too much and spend too little before retirement. When it comes to personal finance, economics keeps one issue front and center: peoples living standards.","Kotlikoff, Laurence J, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Mar,2008
JFP,SPENDING IN RETIREMENT: Easing the Reins or Pulling Them In,"Helping clients achieve a successful retirement is typically the primary goal of a financial plan, and the focal point of the ongoing financial planning relationship. This is particularly true when clients' personal instincts, financial delusions, or ingrained patterns of economic behavior threaten their well-being in retirement -- either by outliving their assets through overspending, or denying themselves the pleasures of a comfortable material standard of living they can easily afford. The crucial task of at least attempting to get retired clients on track is at the core of a planner's duty to clients, according to Judy Hagar, CFP, of Wolters, Hagar &amp; Pratt Financial Planning in San Diego, CA.

JFP,Using Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis to Simplify the Financial Planning Process,"Helping clients make decisions that can significantly affect their lives is one of the critical functions at the heart of the financial planning process. How well that goal is achieved is a true test of the value that the financial planning process brings to a client's situation. Many financial planning events such as where to retire, which college to pick for a child, or which new business opportunity to pursue are decisions that don't readily lend themselves to a traditional mathematical approach. For an HDSM (heuristic decision support methodology) to be useful to the average financial planner, it must satisfy three objectives. First, it needs to help clarify the decision-making process. The second objective is that the methodology greatly simplifies the decision-making process, is user friendly, and is easily understood by the clients. The third and final objective of the HDSM is to provide a baseline decision for whatever problem they have under consideration.","Suplee, William Z, IV, CFA, CFP, ChFC, CASL;Dzubow, Steven R, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Mar,2008

JFP,Pyramid of Success: The Final Chapter,"This ninth and final chapter of the Pyramid of Success has to do with innovation and the sometimes illusory concept of success. There is potential for innovation in at least six areas of the business: 1. ideas, 2. services, 3. systems, 4. processes, 5. products, and 6. marketing. Because innovation starts in the mind it is important to set aside specific times to think about new ideas and evaluate the spontaneous ones. The critical issue is to decide when and how you will implement your best ideas. As you know, giving good service helps determine how long you will keep a client. Good service also produces referrals. Out of all the possible service ideas, you have to carefully evaluate what works for you. The apex of the pyramid simply says ""Success."" You need to define this for yourself. Don't look at success as a destination.

The first question is most crucial: How much is enough? The second question: what is your legacy? More often than not, professional advisors take the financial inventory and run though the initial client discovery with a particular agenda or planning technique in mind. Estate planning products and techniques are nothing more than the tools in the tool box used to assemble the plan. They are not the leading indicators of what is important in creating an estate plan or giving plan. The financial planning profession can help facilitate economic well-being, from local communities to the entire world.

JFP,Quiet Conversations: The Expressive Nature of Socially Responsible Investors,"Few investment issues are more contentious and fraught with misunderstanding than socially responsible investing (SRI). Part of the objection to socially responsible investing is the mixing of the utilitarian nature of investing with the expressive nature of investing. Studies have shown that from a utilitarian standpoint socially responsible investing performs just as well, on average, as conventional investing. This paper focuses on the author's ""quiet conversations"" with eight socially responsible investors, including a Catholic nun, an environmental planner, a video producer, and the owner of military-related companies. Each investor responds to such questions as what matters most to them as socially responsible investors, do they go beyond socially responsible investments such as volunteer work, are they willing to give up returns for social responsibility, and how they assess companies with mixed SRI records. Financial advisors already accept many investment preferences of clients and construct portfolios reflecting these preferences. They should accept clients' preference for socially responsible investments as well.","Statman, Meir, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Feb,2008

For centuries, reading and writing were elite functions given only to certain classes of people. Story is how people link to each other as human beings, and their ability to link experiences through story creates the basis for all social behavior. In shorthand, the spiral of experience is the ""survivor's story."" Some manage it well; others very poorly. But in the financial planning relationship, the major life event could be a death and an inheritance, a family disintegration, the adoption of children, a retirement. Any of these life events can be extremely disorienting. Approaching every client with the idea of story -- about them and their money -- will make you a better planner.

This article addresses some of those questions. Creating a Web site is simple. Site-hosting companies like Yahoo! offer easy-to-use templates that can create a site in minutes. The technology is available to build client-centered sites.

JFP,Recent Developments in Long-Term Care Expenses,"One reason medical expense deductions are greater for higher-income taxpayers is the deductibility of medical expenses associated with senior living. Seniors residing in nursing homes (skilled-nursing units) because of their need for medical care may deduct all of the monthly charges, including expenses for meals. One of the fastest-growing expenditures for states is Medicaid disbursements for nursing home care. Medicaid is available for residents whose assets and income levels dip to benchmarks set by the states in accordance with federal guidelines. Recognizing the role that long-term care insurance can play in preserving Medicaid fluids for those who need it most, states are starting to offer incentives to partner with taxpayers who buy long-term care insurance. Congress has already passed legislation that allows the purchase of long-term care insurance with the cash values of life insurance policies and annuities starting in 2010.","Gardner, Randy, JD, LLM, CPA, CFP;Welch, Julie, CPA, CFP;Salter, John, PhD, AIF, CFP",0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,8-Feb,2008
JFP,Benefits of Protecting Investment Portfolios with Options: A Historical Perspective,"This paper examines the true effectiveness of options in protecting investment portfolios using 1967-2006 stock index data. Options theory typically ignores the bid-ask spread and has no room for volatility skew. While most expensive, buying near- or at-the-money puts works best. Overall the return is similar to unprotected portfolios, but the risk is significantly reduced. Puts provide the highest reward-to-risk ratios. They should be used by investors who are retired or nearing retirement. Put spreads (buy at-the-money puts and sell out-of-the-money puts) are cheaper than puts, but not effective. They result in lower returns and their risk mitigation is weak. A young investor seeking the highest possible return would be better off with a put strategy or no options. Using quarterly option strategies is better than an annual strategy but if done right, both can work well in reducing risk and enhancing return.","Dubil, Robert",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Feb,2008

This article provides guidance in selecting a TIC sponsor: but also alerts advisors and investors to problems within the industry. The tenants-in-common technique allows taxpayers to qualify for like-kind exchanges through co-ownership of property or even multiple properties. The co-ownership is typically handled through a TIC sponsor. TIC owners usually use either a property management company or lease to the TIC sponsor under a master lease structure. Under a master lease, however, the investors ability to recover their investment in an economic downturn is limited. Because of the risks involved in relying on a third party in TIC transactions, Standard &amp; Poor's has established a ranking service of TIC sponsors.","Hopson, James F, JD, CPA;Hopson, Patricia D, CPA",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Feb,2008

The inflow of funds may be the result of a death benefit from a life insurance policy or annuity, an inheritance, or a legal settlement resulting from traumatic injury. People sacrifice to pay life insurance premiums or to save money in annuities or qualified plans. In most cases they choose their beneficiaries carefully. Dissipation risk -- a measure of the probability and rate of fund depletion -- is not a topic typically studied by financial planners. Still, a positive indication of financial planners' success in curtailing dissipation is that people who receive inheritances tend to deplete their funds more slowly than those who win the lottery or settle a personal injury lawsuit. The common characteristic of life insurance, annuity, or qualified plan beneficiaries is that someone loved them enough to give them some money at death.","Cordell, David M, PhD, CFA, CFP, CLU;Tombs, Joseph W, JD, CLU, ChFC, ARM, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jan,2008

JFP,Leland Model More Accurately Evaluates Efficacy of Portfolio Hedging Strategies,"The debate continues between investment advisors who recommend hedging strategies to their customers and academics who question the claims that protective puts and covered calls increase returns while reducing risk. In this study, researchers examine the debate from the perspective that traditional measures of risk-adjusted performance are misleading. Protective puts work well in volatile markets because they ensure limited downside risk and unlimited profit potential for the life of the option. Covered calls work well for bullish or neutral markets expected to experience little movement for the underlying stock. This study introduces the use of Leland's beta to correctly measure risk-adjusted performance. The measurement captures the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis in stock returns. The study examines a variety of put and call options. The results from the Leland model demonstrate the value of both a protective put and a covered call strategy in reducing portfolio risk without significantly affecting return, though transaction costs will reduce this benefit.","Leggio, Karyl B, PhD;Lien, Donald, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jan,2008

Many studies have been done over the years by a number of credible parties, including the SEC itself, all returning similar verdicts: today's regulatory structure could do a much better job of looking out for the public's interests.

This paper proposes a new paradigm for planners: rebalance less frequently, but look more frequently to find the best opportunities for rebalancing. The proposed approach, called opportunistic rebalancing not only controls portfolio drift, but also provides significant return improvements by capturing buy-low/sell-high opportunities as asset dasses sporadically drift relative to each other. The paper studies a wide range of market conditions to show that rebalancing return benefits can be more than doubled compared with the traditional annual rebalancing. These additional benefits, attributed to transient momentum and mean reversion effects, occur sporadically in time and can only be captured by monitoring portfolios frequently. The studies show that trading costs and tax deferral are small compared with rebalance benefits. Opportunistic rebalancing has already been adopted by a number of leading wealth management firms across the US.","Daryanani, Gobind, CFP, PhD",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8-Jan,2008

As financial planners, they need to ensure that throughout the divorce process their client keeps an eye ahead to future financial issues. Keeping a long-term focus could warrant some short-term pain: lifestyle changes may be required. Divorce involves the clash of three unique interests: legal, tax, and financial planning. Retirement plans create myriad complex issues, which means another opportunity for you to add value. Generally, retirement plans cannot be transferred or assigned.

Whenever a client is identified as a non-citizen, the financial planner has immediate tax and estate planning issues to consider. The first task is to determine whether the client -- or the spouse, if applicable -- is a resident alien or a non-resident alien. Once citizenship and domicile status have been determined, the planner must consider various scenarios regarding wealth transfers, both inter vivos and post-mortem. Two important details to verify are whether a treaty exists between the US and the country where the alien is a citizen or resident, and whether there are any important rules regarding gift and estate taxes. No unlimited marital deduction is available to a surviving alien spouse, unless a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) is used. A QDOT results in tax deferral, not tax avoidance.","Basha, Leigh-Alexandra, JD, LLM;Brown, Cal, CFP",0,0,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,8-Jan,2008

To fill that need, Alston's firm developed the Market Return Benchmark, which comprises a variety of uncorrelated equity asset classes with their corresponding benchmark. Accordingly, the firm uses the intermediate Treasury indexes from Lehman Brothers or Morningstar as a benchmark.

Taxpayers are misunderstanding the IRC meanings of higher education expenses, qualified students, first-time homebuyers, and qualified domestic relation orders. The article also presents tax planning techniques that can assist clients in avoiding this penalty tax. These strategies include making distributions from the appropriate qualified retirement plan and ensuring that the court issues a qualified domestic relation order if divorce settlement funds are to be paid from a qualified retirement plan that is not an IRA.","Englebrecht, Ted D, PhD;Hanke, Steven A, CPA;Pierce, Karen J, CPA",0,0,5,1,5,1,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Dec,2007
JFP,"Location, Location, Location","In the real estate business it is said that the three most important factors in determining success are location, location, location. A burgeoning body of research suggests that geographic location is also a factor in the decision-making process of equity investors -- both individual and professional -- affecting not only which stocks are held, but whether to even participate in the stock market at all. What was learned from the combination of these studies is that if you live in an area prone to greater stock market participation and you interact with your community, you will have a greater likelihood of participating in the stock market. A more powerful form of influence is the extent to which the location of nearby investors influences the types of equity investments that are made. Is this rational? There are at least three ways of thinking about it: 1. familiarity breeds comfort, 2. familiarity breeds false confidence, and 3. familiarity breeds an informational advantage.","Riepe, Mark W, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Dec,2007
JFP,To Defer or Not to Defer: The Growing Debate over Tax Diversification,"Conventional wisdom has always encouraged prudent investors to sock away as much as possible in pre-tax accounts. But the prospect of higher taxes due to massive federal deficits and the looming specter of a Democratic Congress and presidency have re-ignited debate over the usefulness of a financial planning strategy known as tax diversification, with emphasis on the word debate. Tax diversification hedges against changes in future tax rates by spreading tax risk across diverse types of taxable and non-taxable vehicles, especially with regard to retirement income. Investors who take current tax benefits by investing as much as possible in pre-tax accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s feel the pain of those benefits later by paying ordinary income tax on retirement distributions. While experts concur that tax uncertainty is the beginning of wisdom, the various strategies discussed in this article for implementing that wisdom clearly remain a matter of debate.","Grote, Jim, CFP",1,1,12,1,13,1,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Dec,2007

While traditional paradigms of family wealth planning focus on best practices for the preservation and transference of financial capital, innovative wealth advisors have begun to embrace a more comprehensive definition of family wealth -- one that includes the human, intellectual, and social capital of family members. Within this four-pillar model of wealth preservation, financial capital becomes the tool by which the other forms of capital are developed and expressed. But even within this broadened definition of wealth, one essential form of capital remains to be elucidated: health capital. As a trusted advisor, your role is to be a steward of your clients' assets and a resource for growing those assets. By considering health as an asset, you engage your clients in a transformational journey of discovery, the impact of which extends far beyond portfolio performance.","Pullen, Courtney;Wehner, Kristin",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Dec,2007

This paper identifies those misunderstandings and outlines a simpler, more accurate algorithmic approach. When MCS is used to return an overall probability of success or failure of a plan, it has not tested the impact of higher or lower returns, nor the impact of sequence risk such as the order of good or bad years of return and the timing of the client's goals. An algorithmic approach (Reliability Forecast) allows for the calculation of the same partial probabilities as generated with MCS, but provides other benefits. The Reliability Forecast simplifies the ability to generate a matrix illustrating multiple success factors -- not just a single success factor for a financial plan. It also separates the planning model from the probability distribution for randomized variables, easing the development effort.","Brayman, Shawn, BSc, MES",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Dec,2007

But unlike most previous research, which uses static allocations, the paper includes a dynamic allocation methodology. It also introduces a methodology to incorporate risk into the decision process. Despite the expected benefits of more sophisticated dynamic distribution allocation strategies, static equity allocations proved to be remarkably efficient. The paper introduces a risk-adjusted measure called the Success to Variability ratio in order to incorporate portfolio variability (standard deviation) into the optimal glide path decision process. When considering a variety of distribution periods and real withdrawal rates, as well as the probability of failure and the Success to Variability ratio, a balanced static allocation, such as 60% equity and 40% fixed income/cash, is likely one of the most efficient portfolio allocations for retirees.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,7-Dec,2007

The fiduciary adviser must agree to provide personalized advice to plan participants and disclose all conflicts of interest, including sources of fees and compensation related to the plan and its investment options.

Conventional financial planning sets targets for people or, worse, has them set their own. This notion that people can set targets is promoting consumption disruption and is completely contradictory to what economics recommends. Conventional planning's use of spending targets also distorts its portfolio advice. Essentially, dynamic programming works by making general plans, starting with the household's last year of life and working backward to the present.

That was then. Enter a more complex retirement reality that reflects the multi-dimensional qualities of the baby boomer's work and life experience in a new century. The changes are coming faster and with more intensity. Helping clients navigate those changes has created a revolution for financial planners as well. Financial planners have a unique role.

There are two reasons to use term insurance. One is because the need is temporary. The other reason to use term insurance is when the need is permanent but there is inadequate cash flow to spend on permanent insurance at the present time. The right to convert from term insurance to permanent without proof of insurability is very important, but judgment needs to be used in knowing if and when to convert. For clients in the economic stage of raising families and accumulating wealth, term insurance is the major type of life insurance to use, probably mixed in with some discounted whole life that is used for the dual purposes of family protection and tax-deferred cash value accumulation.","Katt, Peter C, CFP, LIC",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Nov,2007

JFP,Spotlighting Common Methodological Biases in Active-Vs.-Passive Studies,"The debate over active versus passive investing is confounded by several issues that are not always recognized or dealt with properly. This article highlights the deficiencies common in studies on the benefits of active management, which include: 1. problematic survivor bias methodology, 2. counting funds rather than fund assets, 3. not accounting for multiple share classes, and 4. using a single index to represent passive index performance. This last issue is often referred to as index dependency. A recent article by Holmes (2007) dealing with the active-versus-passive debate contained several of these potential deficiencies, which likely influenced the results. Researchers find considerable variation in the percentage of actively managed funds that beat indexes based on what indexes are used as benchmarks. Moreover, there are material differences in the results when using asset-weighted performance data of actively managed funds rather than simply conducting a head count, and when properly accounting for funds with multiple share classes.","Blanchett, David M, CFP, CLU, AIFA, QPA, CFA;Israelsen, Craig L, PhD",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,7-Nov,2007

Financial planners play a key role in whether a client follows through on a plan. If a client has participated in a dynamic financial planning experience, the natural result of that proven process leads them to implement in steps. Once clients have followed through on the planning ideas and know they are moving toward their goals, they will expect the service the planning process implies. The concept of service covers everything that happens after implementation. The Great service also triggers an ongoing discovery process about a client. As this happens, the perception of value increases and questions about fees and payments recede or are eliminated. The planning process that a client experiences leads to automatic implementation and the opportunity to provide excellent service based on trust and integrity.","Hayden, Vern C, CFP",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,6,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Nov,2007

Third-party trusts are a useful alternative for clients who feel that neither the value of their assets nor their potential creditor exposure warrant creating a more comprehensive asset protection plan such as an offshore or domestic asset protection trust. A typical third-party trust involves one family member settling (creating) a trust for the benefit of another family member (primary beneficiary). A third-party trust will have two trustees that manage the assets -- an independent trustee and a family trustee. The primary beneficiary typically serves as the family trustee. A third-party trust can be designed to be either a domestic trust or a foreign trust. Foreign trusts afford stronger asset protection features. Even if a third-party trust is foreign for asset protection law purposes, it can still be designed as a domestic trust for income tax purposes.","Brown, Edward D, JD, LLM, CPA;Kaplan, Eric R, JD",1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,7-Nov,2007

The most pressing risk management issues for the vast majority of clients, say planners and P&amp;C specialists, revolve around getting the right auto and homeowners policies in place. But the risk of under-insurance is probably far more likely to be the result of lack of attention to the issue by homeowners and their advisors than deceptive practices on the part of insurance carriers and brokers.

This paper demonstrates that a blanket ""4% withdrawal"" rule may be an oversimplification of a complex set of circumstances. Risk tolerance, asset allocation, withdrawal size, and expected returns all affect the process of withdrawing from a retirement portfolio. To advance previous research, this paper uses 21 stock/bond allocations and 71 withdrawal rates, for 1,491 possible combinations. For each of these combinations, 10,000 bootstrap iterations are run for 30-year periods. Results show that withdrawal rates as high as 5.5% to 6% can be achieved, but only at a 25% to 30% chance of running out of money and with stock allocations of 75% to 100%. A 4.4% withdrawal rate with a 50/50 bond/stock allocation has a 10% chance of running out of money.","Spitzer, John J, PhD;Strieter, Jeffrey C, PhD;Singh, Sandeep, PhD, CFA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Oct,2007

Some of these incentives include the ability to write off an even higher amount of equipment in the year of purchase and an extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. But to help offset the cost of the tax incentive provisions, the law again increases the age of children subject to the kiddie tax, which taxes children's unearned income of more than $1,700 at their parents' tax rate, generally resulting in higher tax.

But financial planners cannot afford to overlook the thousands of certified financial planner certificants who practice planning inside major firms.

The goal of the alliance is twofold: to genuinely serve the best interests of the client and provide a referral source for each other's services. The planner serves as the quarterback of the alliance. The planner also provides initial and ongoing coaching to equip each allied professional with the ability to identify and address clients' dreams, desires, and goals -- what the financial planning profession calls life planning. The alliance usually is informal, but it may want to develop joint marketing efforts where all alliance members participate in events for clients and potential clients. The alliance may even want to create a formal business relationship through a limited liability company.

To properly advise their clients, financial advisors need to get a firm grip on clients' plans for enjoying their newfound freedom. To determine the best course of action for saving today, advisors need to understand what the client plans on accomplishing during each phase of life, especially in retirement. Typically, the first several hours of consultation are spent listening to determine a client's goals, hopes, and dreams for them and their family. Once they are able to determine the planned uses of a client's retirement nest egg, they then determine how large that nest egg needs to be and how to build it.

David Wray, president of the Profit Sharing Council of America, predicts that the auto-enrollment programs, including all plans, will raise current participation levels from around 70% to over 83%. Despite advancements in DC-plan autoprogram success, plan sponsors acknowledge that they all have more work to do. To offer more effective educational assistance, employers may turn to benefit providers, their own professional staffs, or outside consultants.

That requires four distinct elements: trust, clarity competence, and management. These four elements compose the Confidence Formula, an equation for creating positive planning results. The client must have sufficient clarity about what he or she is trying to achieve. They must be emotionally excited about their goals. That emotional clarity must be documented, and that documentation shared with the full advisory team. The client must be confident about the technical competence of the advisory team. Lack of management can undermine a plan. One advisor or firm must take complete ownership of the wealth holders ability to first achieve clarity and then achieve implementation and ongoing management of the result.","Fithian, Scott;Fithian, Todd",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Sep,2007

Several assets often are neglected in the asset allocation decision, even though their diversification benefits have been very high.

JFP,Using Decision Rules to Create Retirement Withdrawal Profiles,"This paper describes an approach where retirees define their desired retirement withdrawal profiles and then establish rules for retirement asset withdrawals to maximize total purchasing power. This approach allows retirees to control their retirement; they are no longer subject to one-size-fits-all withdrawal strategies or rules of thumb. The paper defines three primary retirement profiles. Under the uniform profile, withdrawals are steady throughout retirement; the progressive profile exhibits increased withdrawals in real dollars; and under the aggressive profile retirees make larger withdrawals early in retirement, followed by decreasing amounts. The paper illustrates all three profiles using a $1 million portfolio over a 40-year retirement period. After a retiree chooses the profile and the success rate that fits his or her retirement outlook, three decision rules can be applied to govern the amount withdrawn annually from investment assets and ideally boost the amounts safely withdrawn each year. Using decision rules dramatically increased the present value of the total withdrawals over scenarios with no decision rules, while still achieving a 99% success rate.","Klinger, William J",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,8,1,9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Aug,2007

JFP,Modern Portfolio Decumulation: A New Strategy for Managing Retirement Income,"This article outlines a strategy to improve the ability to obtain a stable and steady stream of distributions for life from a retirement portfolio and at the same time fund future wealth goals, such as for gifts and bequests. Typically planners suggest managing longevity risk either by annuitization or in the spending plan. This paper proposes an alternative method for managing it in the investment portfolio. Conventional approaches often fail to properly define the investment problem. To be effective, it is important to fully address longevity risk and use appropriate and complete measures of risk and risk aversion. For this problem, modern portfolio theory is an inadequate framework for portfolio construction. A new multiple-period, cash-flow-based investment framework is described that incorporates a dynamic asset allocation strategy and uses the cost of lifetime annuitization as a hurdle for managing longevity risk in the portfolio. By transforming longevity risk into investment risk and actively managing it in the investor's portfolio rather than the spending plan, this approach is particularly useful for investors with a strong desire to maintain a given standard of living.","Fullmer, Richard K",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Aug,2007
JFP,Does the Turnover of an Equity Mutual Fund Matter?,"It is often claimed that high rates of portfolio turnover erode the performance of an equity mutual fund. The explicit hypothesis behind this view is that high turnover creates more transactions costs and these costs act as a drag on fund performance. The implicit hypothesis is that portfolio turnover generates only costs and no alpha. The authors' view is that the relationship between turnover and portfolio performance is more nuanced than conventional wisdom would suggest. When these nuances are accounted for, turnover is not very effective when compared with other variables one might use to evaluate a fund to be held in a tax-deferred account. The authors' empirical work on this topic has five novel features. These are: 1. use of relative fund returns, 2. control for more variables, 3. nonlinearity, 4. dependence on category, and 5. dependence on skill. The results indicate that portfolio turnover is rarely a significant variable.","Peterson, James D;Riepe, Mark W",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Aug,2007

JFP,"Variable Annuities: From Controversial to Mainstream Using a Two-Bucket Strategy, Part 1","The first of the two part series on investment strategy is presented. This two-part article challenges conventional wisdom that suggests investors allocate their portfolio with lower-cost investment products that diversify unwanted stock market risk by allocating monies to fixed accounts and bonds. This article systematically back tests an alternative two-bucket strategy that shifts a portion of an investors stock market risk for an extra cost to a variable annuity with lifetime withdrawal benefits. After back testing the two-bucket strategy with variable annuity against a lower-cost traditional mutual fund strategy over every 30-year time horizon from 926 through 2004, the study found that the two-bucket strategy achieved approximately 18% higher average income and approximately 369% greater average inheritance with the assumptions tested. These findings might alleviate part of the negative stigma surrounding variable annuities based on previous controversial benefits which many people, including financial planners, feel do not justify the extra costs. This research introduces an alternative strategy that investors and advisors can use to transfer stock market risk which could help maximize income and leave a larger inheritance for ones beneficiaries.","Bernicke, Ty A",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Aug,2007

Experience suggests that the two biggest traps for your clients in the operation of private foundations are day-to-day governance and self-dealing. This article will examine both of these issues in hopes of providing a simple road map that will help your clients through the regulatory maze. The typical board of directors consists of Mom, Dad, and the adult kids. All too often, the family members who are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the foundation take a laissez faire attitude.

JFP,From Industry to Profession: Client Discovery Tools,"Not only is seeking professional advice and direction important, but the foundation for that advice must be built upon personal values. Values refer to qualities of life and that which gives meaning and purpose to life from the client's perspective. The wheels of the financial services industry are so well lubricated with product companies and broker/dealers delivering their products that it would be ludicrous to think that removing a product-centric focus could be forced on them. This has to happen as planners lead by example. This will transpire in several steps. The first step is for planners to hire their own financial planner and follow their advice. Second, individual advisors must behave and operate in a client-centric manner.

JFP,Expanding the Investment Mix Beyond Mutual Funds,"The range and versatility of portfolio management tools continues to increase beyond the standard fare of mutual funds. Several of these products, specifically separately managed accounts (SMAs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), have been gaining widespread acceptance. This article examines the different ways planners are using these accounts to boost clients' portfolios. Some use SMAs as the primary investment vehicle with large accounts, while others focus on specific investment strategies. Atlanta Financial Associates Inc works with approximately 200 households. The firm started converting clients to fee-based platforms in 2003, according to Julianne Andrews, CFP, a principal with the firm. From humble beginnings in 1990, ETFs have grown dramatically. Some began using them because they lacked alternative solutions. At Atlanta Financial Associates, Andrews started using ETFs as a small-cap placeholder in clients' portfolios because the mutual funds that her firm had selected for small-cap allocations were closed to new investors. Consequently, many planners routinely work with separate accounts and ETFs, and the shift toward those vehicles appears to be accelerating.","McCarthy, Ed",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Aug,2007

Most Certified Financial Planners (CFPs) really do understand the CFP Board's code of ethics. But he think they have to separate understanding from application. Your diligence had better include an acceptable alternative. In cases like this, planners know they are correct when they say it is in the client's best interest. In his opinion, it is just too gray an area to push on when the client does not understand. In any relationship between planner and client, both parties should be benefiting. If there is any inner thought about whether one of you loses, something is wrong.

JFP,Interviewing Prospects and 'Experiencing' the Planning Process,"While basic values such as honesty and trustworthiness are extremely important, you and your client should not have to agree on a number of other values. Whether you are giving a speech or are in discussion, clients will likely remember a story you tell rather than some quantitative point. Information from a client is subjective, objective, and subject to constant change because the client's life is a continuum of dynamic -- not static -- activity. The Everest of planning takes place when you are able to enlarge and change someone's comfort zone to include actions necessary to move them continually toward a successful financial life. To create positive chap in your clients' lives, you must help them broaden their comfort zone. To be effective, clients need to experience the planning process.

Yet your ability to do that depends on understanding what your clients want. Law says it is important that, whatever surveying option planners choose, the process begins with the question, Why do I want client feedback? E.W. Young, certified financial planner, Quest Capital Management, has surveyed clients for 20 years. As the firm has matured, Young says planners felt the need to get back in touch with clients. Julie Littlechild, founder, Advisor Impact, coached the firm in developing questions.

Heffernan sees the huge explosion of women-owned businesses as a major business story that not enough people are paying attention to. Shine said many women do not go out and start a business because they cannot stand their boss or cannot ""make it"" in the corporate world. They just have a great idea and decide to do it themselves. Heffernan said the younger generation of women starting businesses is willing to accept higher levels of risk in business primarily because they do not believe there is safety inside large corporations.

JFP,Immigrants and Natives to Wealth: Understanding Clients Based on Their Wealth Origins,"The origin of clients' wealth leads to differences in their personal adjustment, parenting, attitudes, behavior how they want to pass on their wealth. Financial planners should be sensitive to the origins of clients' wealth in order to facilitate understanding, provide support, and guide choices about life planning and intergenerational communication. Those who acquire wealth such as through the development and sale of a business typically have a more fully formed sense of self before coming to wealth. Those native-born to wealth must develop their sense of identity out of a culture of affluence that is sometimes antithetical to that effort. Both immigrants and native-born worry about how to teach their children to handle wealth responsibly. Even more challenging to a financial planner is working with cross-class couples. This paper presents two prototypical wealthy couples -- one who acquired wealth in their lifetime and one raised with wealth from childhood. It then presents ways advisors can inquire into these issues in the client-relationship process.","Grubman, James;Jaffe, Dennis T",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jul,2007

Even if companies actually have designed hedging formulas, such exotic strategies are notoriously inaccurate, the bust of subprime lending practices being the most recent example of how financial wizards are able to outsmart themselves.

The study examines how the choice of savings vehicles, such as a Roth IRA, tax-deferred account, or taxable account, affects the portions of principal effectively owned by, return received by, and risk borne by the individual investor. This study explains how an investor's stock management strategy affects the after-tax risk and returns on stocks held in taxable accounts. It demonstrates that, in a mean-variance optimization, a bond held in a retirement account is effectively a different asset than a bond held in a taxable account.

The data consist of US equity returns, foreign equity returns, and six foreign currencies from 1975 to 2006. A portfolio optimization technique is applied using actual and simulated data to test the long-term portfolio implications of foreign currency investment. The results indicate that investment in foreign currency improves the Shape ratio and is a potential defensive asset given its low correlation with US equities. Theoretically, holding foreign currency over the long term is potentially beneficial to US investors. But to achieve the maximum benefit, US investors may have to unrealistically concentrate their funds exclusively in foreign equities, with a substantial investment in foreign currency. In a global equity portfolio containing 60%-80% US stocks, the incremental benefit of adding foreign currency provides a negligible improvement.","Ratner, Mitchell;Meric, Gulser;Meric, Ilhan",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jul,2007

It encompasses a variety of elements: data gathering, personal goals, investment planning, lifetime income stream, long-term care, trusts, wills, powers of attorney, and modeling for the ""what if"" scenarios, among others. If savvy planners learn what retirement planning means for each client, they can uncover clues to a more effective, efficient, and satisfying approach when addressing the rather large universe of retirement planning needs. Perhaps an approach to helping people create their retirement dream is two-pronged: retirement planning and retirement preparation.

JFP,When Should Women Claim Social Security Benefits?,"This paper summarizes the incentives facing older women when deciding when to claim their Social Security benefits. Nearly 60 percent of women opt for actuarially reduced benefits at age 62-a greater percentage than men. Yet women are expected to live longer than men. Longer life expectancy would generally suggest delaying Social Security benefits. But the analysis shows that single women and married women face very different choices. Married women are entitled to three types of benefits: (1) benefits based on their own earning records, (2) spouse's benefits based on their husband's earning records, or (3) survivor's benefit equal to 100 percent of their husband's benefits. These benefits are reduced if claimed earlier than the full retirement age. From the authors' study, two key points emerge. First, in the case of survivors' benefits, the husband usually can maximize the benefits of the couple or his surviving wife by delaying his claim. Second, the wife is usually better off claiming her own Social Security benefits as early as possible, though this can change depending what percentage her own benefits are of her husband's benefits. For most married women, the Social Security benefit structure actually encourages them to grab their benefits as soon as possible. While this may maximize the wife's Social Security ""wealth,"" it also encourages them to withdraw from the labor force, creating a loss of earnings and 401(k) savings, and extending the period over which they need to support themselves in retirement.

JFP,What's New? A Potpourri of Investment Research,"No one will be surprised that there were a number of articles discussing the advantages of active versus passive investing. Although the debate admittedly seems endless, the reality is that practitioners provide advice daily that, either consciously or unconsciously, reflects an opinion on this subject. Consequently, the author believes it is the responsibility of every practitioner to ensure that the philosophical basis of his or her investment advice is based on thoughtful and continuing research on the subject. The only investment subject getting as much or more coverage than active versus passive is asset allocation. Perhaps not as big a professional story as the prior subjects, ""life cycle"" investing is a popular story with the public media. As practitioners they spend a great deal of time and effort focused on the softer side of their clients' needs; however, they ultimately face the reality of implementation. In the complex world of modern finance, that is a daunting challenge.","Evensky, Harold",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jun,2007

JFP,Is Rebalancing a Portfolio During Retirement Necessary?,"This paper investigates the strategy of rebalancing the retirement portfolio during the withdrawal phase. The goal is to provide the largest number of equal (real) withdrawals from a given retirement portfolio. The study investigates six different allocations of stock and five different harvesting rules, only one of which rebalances the portfolio annually. The methods are tested using five different withdrawals rates (3-7 percent). The results look at shortfalls over 30 years, as well as shorter periods. The study uses two analysis methods: bootstrap and historical inflation-adjusted rates of return in their true temporal order. Both methods find that rebalancing provides no significant protection on portfolio longevity, and this holds for all withdrawal periods. In fact, in some cases, rebalancing increases the number of shortfalls. Withdrawing bonds first, over stocks, performs the best of all the methods, though the resulting stock-heavy portfolio may make some investors uneasy. This method also is most apt to leave a larger remaining balance at the end of 30 years, while rebalancing leaves the smallest amount. Withdrawing stocks first leaves more shortfalls than withdrawing low first or high first. Confirming previous research, the larger the proportion of stocks to bonds, the longer the portfolio lasts; the higher the withdrawal rate, the more shortfalls. The results suggest that the use of life-cycle funds or a life-cycle strategy that decreases stock proportions as one grows older needs empirical justification.

JFP,Advisors and Clients in the Brave New World of Philanthropy,"More and more donors are looking to their financial planners rather than to their favorite charities for advice on making serious gifts. According to a study of donors by the National Committee on Planned Giving, when donors were asked to identify the origin of the idea for their planned gift, they found that financial and legal advisors provided the impetus in 29% of the cases for charitable bequests and 68% for charitable remainder trusts, both up roughly five times the comparable 1992 results. The groundswell of giving in the US has fueled the demand for such advice. And the increasingly high-profile nature of philanthropy may be increasing the supply of donors through a kind of trickle-down generosity. Kathy Longo, CFP, a principal with Accredited Investors, a comprehensive financial planning firm in Minneapolis, MN, approaches philanthropy as part of her annual review process. Despite the conflicts of interest inherent in this altruistic field, she keeps her eye on the results of the intricate charitable planning process.","Grote, Jim",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jun,2007

Family caregiving is not the same as professional caregiving, since people are talking about unpaid work. Author Beth Witrogen McLeod, a double-Pulitzer Prize nominee, has written extensively on the issue of caregiving. McLeod's experience reflects a growing reality. Most caregivers are women, many of whom juggle some combination of work, family, and marital demands at home, including child care, while trying to meet the needs of aging and impaired parents or other loved ones. According to McLeod, depression rates are higher, up to 76%, for intense caregivers supervising those with maladies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, or other forms of dementia, or neuropathic and peripheral nerve diseases. Caregiving issues will be an expanding and increasingly complex component of holistic planning.","Walker, Lewis J",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jun,2007

The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made a number of significant changes to the health savings account (HSA) rules starting in 2007. These changes make it more economically appealing and easier for employees to transition from traditional health care coverage to coverage through an HSA. In Private Letter Ruling 200704017, a professional firm chose to self-insure its partners and employees because of the high cost of medical insurance. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 provides a boost to cash value life insurance arrangements, annuities, and long-term care insurance. The three strategies discussed in this article allow a dual benefit from your premiums. HSA and self-insurance accumulations constitute savings that can be rolled forward for future expenses or reduce future contributions. Cash accumulations in life insurance and annuities can be distributed or used to buy long-term care insurance, if needed.","Gardner, Randy;Welch, Julie",1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jun,2007

JFP,Using Three-Factor Theory to Assess Investment Performance,"In an effort to refine Sharpe's capital asset pricing model, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French advanced a three-factor model including risk premiums for size and value effects. In an effort to make this theory more accessible to practitioners, this article describes factor loading, expected return, and the determination of alpha that result from three-factor regression analysis. When exposure to the size and value premiums is considered, the returns of most active mutual fund managers are no greater than that which is predicted by the three-factor model. This would suggest that similar investment returns may be achieved through passive strategies with targeted exposure to the risk factors. Among all domestic equity funds, the occurrence of statistically significant alpha over trailing 10- and 15-year periods was extremely rare when measured against the three-factor model. The few funds that did outperform expectations have typically done so in isolated periods. Although the records of some mutual funds have appeared to be robust relative to existing benchmarks, they typically capture no more return than a passively managed portfolio with similar three-factor characteristics.

JFP,Serving the Underserved: The Middle Market Gap,"The first part of a series on different models for delivery of financial planning to underserved markets is presented. According to recent consumer research conducted by the Financial Planning Association, the demographic with the greatest demand for the services of a CFP professional is the 35-45 age group in the middle market/lower mass affluent socioeconomic category. Researchers at Cerulli Associates have published a model that explains much in the way of how financial advice is provided to the various consumer markets. In their model, technology-based support and intermediary-based support can be ""scaled"" to serve different segments of the audience. The less wealth the client has, the more technology can be used to streamline interaction. Meanwhile, Ameriprise planners have three key systems that allow them to offer a scalable model and facilitate the large-scale delivery of financial planning: customized financial planning software, a virtual back-office plan development center, and a browser-based client reporting system that provides clients with key measures in real time.","Walters, Sean R",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-May,2007

JFP,Who's the Fairest of Them All? A Comparative Analysis of Financial Advisor Compensation Models,"There are three primary modes by which investors pay for financial advice: commissions, asset-based fees, and flat fees. This paper examines the economic incentives at work in each and suggests that the debate over which model is ""fairest"" is flawed because all three models contain incentives that can lead to conflicts of interest and each may also represent an optimal choice for certain investor circumstances. The recent trend away from commissions in favor of fee-only planning may not represent a best-practice model for the profession. Alternatively the ideal compensation platform may be one that incorporates all three models. There is little evidence to suggest that regulatory differences lead fee-based advisors to be either more qualified or to act more ethically than commission-based advisors; however the fee-based models are clearly superior with respect to fiduciary disclosure requirements. It can be argued that regulatory inequality denigrates the commission models credibility.","Robinson, John H",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-May,2007

But the right coach at the right time can bring new insights to your practice, just as you strive to bring new insights to your clients. Bedda D'Angelo, president of Fiduciary Solutions, believes a successful coaching relationship needs both comfort and challenge. The coach's expertise is another factor to consider.

Although the votes for the so-called broker/dealer rule, which exempts fee-based brokerage programs from the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, outnumber the ones opposed 6-2, the latter are the ones that matter. A fight in Congress appears imminent. There is no question that the Financial Planning Association is outgunned on Capitol Hill. But there have been other groups who share the same concern -- not only in the financial planning profession, but among consumer and state regulator associations. The $64,000 question may not be about whether the securities industry is able to reinstate the broker/dealer rule by amending the Advisers Act, but whether the broader debate over fiduciary protections for the public will generate calls for major reform beyond a simple amendment.","Thompson, Duane",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-May,2007

JFP,Life-Cycle Investing Is Rolling Our Way,"Drawing on 1950s models, the financial planning community uses mainly precautionary savings and diversification strategies to manage personal wealth. But financial economists and many others in the financial services industry have moved on to a new paradigm known as life-cycle investing. Life-cycle investing is a multi-period model that uses hedging and insuring as well as precautionary saving and diversification as core strategies. Personal wealth is defined as the sum of current financial wealth and the present value of an investor's human capital-that is, what an investor's labor will earn during his or her lifetime. In contrast to the current paradigm, welfare is measured by lifetime consumption, not wealth. The combination of life-cycle investing theory and the great innovation in the derivatives markets since the 1970s has set the stage for a new generation of retail investment products. The new default 401(k) withdrawal may soon be an inflation-indexed annuity with a guaranteed floor and participation in market appreciation. Instead of talking about optimal portfolio withdrawal and rebalancing strategies, clients and their planners will focus more on how much and at what rate to annuitize financial wealth. At the moment, planners are uncomfortable with such widespread use of options and other derivative securities. But the implication for planners is that this paradigm shift in financial theory and product innovation is about to fundamentally change how we work with clients and how we structure our businesses.

JFP,The Passive Approach to Commodity Investing,"Investing in commodities is one potential avenue to improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio in the current environment of low bond yield and low equity-risk premium. The emergence of commodity exchange-traded funds has facilitated access to commodity markets while preserving the most advantageous features of passive commodity investing. The advantages of integrating a passive commodity investment in a portfolio include better diversification, better protection from inflation, and an interesting expected return. The article shows the risk-reduction benefits from introducing commodities into a traditional 60/40 stock/bond portfolio. Passive commodity investing can earn positive returns due to an implicit ""insurance premium"" in the futures contract, to index rebalancing, and to the return of the T-bills used to fully collateralize the positions in futures. A study examines and verifies that these sources of returns materialized into actual returns from 1970 to 2006.","Plante, Jean-François;Roberge, Mathieu",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-May,2007
JFP,Automobile Insurance and the CFP Certificant,"Unless you made a transition to financial planning from a career in the property and casualty insurance business, you probably do not know much more about auto insurance than your clients do. When clients ask you a question about their property and casualty insurance, you probably beg off, suggesting that they review their policies with a competent P&amp;C agent. If you are really on top of your game, you may provide a stern admonition that they obtain an umbrella policy. With respect to collision and comprehensive, lien holder requirements must be honored, but planners should recommend judicious use of self-insurance. Although providing judicious advice about auto insurance does not directly generate fees or commissions for the planner, the benefits to the client are obvious. And the benefit to the planner is cementing a relationship that will generate not only other sources of income, but referrals as well.","Cordell, David M;Lemoine, Craig",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-May,2007

JFP,Moving from Small-Business Owner to Secure Retiree,"One particular group that will need extensive retirement planning is small-business owners. Research shows that less than half of family businesses survive the second generation. This low survival rate suggests that passing the family-run business to the next generation will not have a positive long-term financial impact on the family's overall wealth. Therefore, it is always suggested that small-business owners explore all financial alternatives. When financial planners construct portfolios for retirees, one of our top priorities is achieving a diversified portfolio. If tax deferral is a client's key concern, then an installment sale may be the most effective course of action.

This plan is a form of cross-tested defined-contribution retirement plan that typically takes the form of a discretionary profit-sharing plan. This type of plan will successfully pass the nondiscrimination rules applicable to all tax-qualified plans as long as it satisfies one of two minimum ""gateway requirements,"" or provides a ""broadly available"" allocation rate to all employees or a ""gradual age or service schedule"" option. The plan works especially well where the owners of a small business are of different ages, but earn approximately the same amount of compensation, thus precluding an age-based plan.","Fevurly, Keith R",0,0,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Apr,2007
JFP,Dr. Gene Cohen on Whether Old Dogs Can Learn New Tricks. Answer: Yes!,"In an interview, Gene Cohen, director, Center on Aging, Health &amp; Humanities, talked about older adults. Older adults know themselves better and they know where they are good at and what is important to them. They often have a new, inner sense of confidence, courage, and conviction to act on what they want to do and not wait and see what others will say or think. Views about mature adults are changing because of some very exciting scientific discoveries about the brain. At the close of the 20th century people learned that the brain ""remodels"" itself in a more efficient and powerful way as they get older. The human body actually has a lot of creative redundancy -- it has two kidneys, two lungs, two eyes, and so on. In effect, it has two brains. The ability to grow new brain cells and integrate both hemispheres of the brain is the same for males and females.","Lee, Shelley A",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Apr,2007

JFP,National Savings Rate Guidelines for Individuals,"This study creates savings guidelines for typical individuals with different ages, income levels, and initial accumulated wealth so the public can more easily determine how much to save for retirement. It also creates benchmarks for how much capital an individual would have accumulated based on their income and age, with the presumption that they started saving at age 35. The study differs from previous savings studies in several important ways. Perhaps most key is that the savings guidelines and capital needs are calculated on retirement income as a percent of net pre-retirement income -- gross income minus annual ref retirement savings in pre-retirement. The study shows the urgency of starting to save no after than age 35. It also suggests that those whose income increases faster than inflation will have to save an increasing amount to ""catch up"" so as to be able to provide for the higher assumed standard of living in retirement.","Ibbotson, Roger;Xiong, James;Kreitler, Robert P;Kreitler, Charles F;Chen, Peng",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Apr,2007

Children benefit from philanthropic role models. Being a charitable parent in front of children helps form charitable kids. In fact, being a financially intelligent parent in front of kids helps foster financial intelligence in them. Getting a teenager started if he or she has not been involved as a volunteer before may be a bit more challenging than dealing with a younger child.

Even greater savings are possible when the use of a QPRT is combined with fractional interest discounts and grantor trusts. A QPRT is an irrevocable trust to which the grantor transfers his or her personal residence or vacation home, or an interest therein. If the grantor survives the term of the trust, the QPRT terminates and the residence is either retained in further trust for or distributed outright to one or more third parties selected by the grantor. During the term of his or her retained right to live in the residence, the grantor will remain responsible for all repairs, mortgage payments, real property taxes, and other expenses. During the term of the grantor's retained interest, the grantor has the right to sell the residence and buy a replacement residence.","Gallo, Jon",0,0,4,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Apr,2007

In a previous study, all the technique lined up close to linearly when plotted in risk-return space. There was no apparent advantage in terms of risk-adjusted returns from using a specific technique. Here are tips when rebalancing in a taxable account: 1. Exert more care when rebalancing in taxable accounts. 2. Avoid generating rebalancing trades by directing new money into underweighted asset classes. 3. When sensible, execute trades to generate tax losses that can then be used to offset any capital gains generated by rebalancing trades. 4 Be patient and wait until eligible for long-term capital gains treatment. 5. If taxable and tax-deferred accounts are both allocated toward the same goal, have the tax-deferred account bear as much of the rebalancing load as possible.","Riepe, Mark W;Swerbenski, Bill",1,1,6,1,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Apr,2007

JFP,Helping Clients Change: 21st Century Tools from a 19th Century Fable,"A fundamental tool in working with difficult clients is accepting that their past experiences affect their behavior in the present. A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, is a useful metaphor for helping clients understand this truth. In the story, Ebenezer Scrooge was not a miser by conscious choice; he was acting in accordance with hidden beliefs about money, or money scripts. Destructive financial behavior is not about money, but grows out of unfinished business from the past; the Ghost of Christmas Past helped Scrooge come to this realization. Integrated financial planning, which combines the emotional, or interior, aspects of finance with exterior financial knowledge, provides an expanded set of tools for working with these difficult clients. Acting as an effective change agent includes taking advantage of crisis points, establishing your credibility as an expert, building a relationship of trust with clients, being persistent, and following the lead of the client.","Kahler, Rick;Klontz, Ted;Klontz, Brad",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Apr,2007

This paper applies a model for change and suggests augmenting techniques for financial planners that can help women investors improve their investing behavior. The model is called the transtheoretical model of change, which only recently has been applied to financial behavior. Instead of trying to get adults to change their behavior instantaneously, the model takes a person through five successive stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The paper recommends techniques for planners to help their female clients successfully move from one stage to the next. A person may not successfully stay on course on the first attempt. Relapse and recycling during stages occur frequently.","Loibl, Cäzilia;Hira, Tahira K",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Mar,2007

A 2006 study by Financial Research Corp (FRC) suggests that advisors could add to that growth. Perhaps more than demographic changes, changes to the variable annuities themselves are responsible for driving product growth. And those changes can be summed up in two words: living benefits. Having long objected to variable annuities for all but very active traders because annuities convert capital gains to ordinary income, Peter Katt, CFP, LIC, of Katt &amp; Co, has a large issue with the new living-benefits guarantees. Accordingly, Katt advises planners to resist the emotional product pitches and evaluate variable annuities in the same rational manner they would analyze other products.","Opiela, Nancy",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Mar,2007

The phased-income approach discussed in this article takes a significantly different approach by starting its focus on risk-based issues at the end of retirement. It then works backward to create a wealth-distribution strategy that aligns retirees' income with their changing needs during retirement. This phased approach estimates and funds income beyond age 95 to minimize the risk of outliving assets. It also addresses risk-based needs for health care, long-term care (LTC), and legacies. On average, the process generated the following outcomes: 1. It generated initial income at age 65 that was nearly twice the traditional 4% solution. 2. It produced more cumulative income from age 65 to 95 than the traditional method. 3. It produced slightly less consumable income beyond age 95 than the traditional methods, but left income to help pay estimated health care and LTC premiums from 65 to 105, assuming 7% inflation.","Robinson, Charles D",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Mar,2007

When working with clients, retirement planners may find themselves in a situation similar to Cassandra's plight. Retirement planners face their own set of challenges in effectively communicating contingencies to their clients. Foreseeing the future for retirement planning clients may trigger strong reactions from them. To some clients, the words of the financial planner are as unbelievable as Cassandra's words were to the Greeks.

To increase the chance of above-average returns, the authors believe a manager must be allowed to pursue a consistent style and allow portfolio size and value/growth characteristics to drift over time. The authors present the results from studies and propose two reasons drifters perform better: 1. Drifters perform better because restricting a manager to a single characteristic box makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue an equity style. 2. Drifters perform better because they are free to take advantage of strong characteristic reversal effects in stock returns.

And, indeed, the majority of today's retirees are able to afford a decent retirement. But this group is living in a ""golden age"" that will fade as baby boomers and Generation Xers reach traditional ages in the coming decades. Because many Americans appear unaware of disquieting trends, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has developed the National Retirement Risk Index (NRRI). The NRRI measures the share of working-age households who are at risk of being unable to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living in retirement. The NRRI assumes that three types of wealth are annuitized at retirement: financial assets, 401(k) balances, and money received from a reverse mortgage on the household's primary residence.","Munnell, Alicia H;Eschtruth, Andrew D",0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,6,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Mar,2007

Planners need to ""prepare the container"" for life planning by establishing boundaries, such as deciding whether to work with relatives and friends or socialize with clients.

Correctly applying these regulations provides taxpayers with a safe-harbor value that will be acceptable to the Internal Revenue Service. The problem is that valuations performed under the safe harbor of these regulations are quite punitive and in many instances do not reflect a policy's fair market value. The account value dramatically overstates a policy's intrinsic value but these new regs severely limit factoring in the interplay of surrender charges, and this is why they often overstate a policy's market value. Significantly, the new regulations do not take into account the insured's health or other factors. This can mean that the safe-harbor valuation will be lower, and sometimes much lower than what people would consider the more accurate market value.","Katt, Peter C",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Mar,2007

JFP,Recent Developments Help Avoid the Double Tax on IRD Property,"One of the most frequently encountered and least understood income tax/estate planning problems is the heavy tax burden imposed on income in respect of decedent (IRD) property. Planners need to plan carefully with IRD assets, watching for opportunities to avoid the estate tax and reduce the marginal income tax rate. Here are some planning strategies: 1. Identify who is going to pay the estate tax. 2. Do not forget to claim the income tax deduction for the estate taxes paid. 3. If possible, defer the payment of income tax on the IRD by postponing the receipt of IRD income. 4, If the decedent has a marginal income tax rate lower than the beneficiaries, execute a Roth conversion or distribute the IRD asset to the decedent before death. 5. Avoid estate tax by transferring the IRD asset to the surviving spouse. 6. Avoid estate tax by transferring the IRD asset to charity.","Gardner, Randy;Welch, Julie A",1,1,11,1,12,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Feb,2007
JFP,Tech Tools for Disaster Recovery,"If you surveyed financial advisors as to whether they have a disaster recovery plan, you would probably receive a 100 percent affirmative response. Given the resulting chaos that accompanies disasters, though, it is likely that even the most thorough recovery plan will encounter unforeseen problems. The good news is that a host of accessible backup technologies can reduce a disaster's impact and speed the recovery to normal operations. Martin Hopkins, CFP, president of ML Hopkins &amp; Co LLC, uses an Internet-based backup service to store his critical data and he uses several external hard drives that he stores offsite. Philip Rothstein, president of Rothstein Associates Inc, recommends that financial planning and wealth advisory firms follow the same process that any business should for business continuity planning: understand their threats, vulnerabilities, and exposures to loss. After identifying its exposures, a firm can decide which systems and data it needs to back up.","McCarthy, Ed",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Feb,2007

JFP,"Making of the Profession Roundtable:: the Publics Memory, the Public Benefit, a Professions Foundation-and Where You Go from Here","In a roundtable discussions, several executives talked about ten key questions about the making of the financial planning profession. Charles G. Hughes, founder and principal, CG Hughes Co, said that the public has a short memory, but when consumers today are confronted with a situation that feels like that old image they may have forgotten -- planners as product pushers -- it tends to confirm the previous perception. Tom Bradley, President, TDAmeritrade Institutional, said that because so many planners are independent, it is hard to get consensus on many things. Ultimately, he thinks they will see more financial planning help and guidance for the large middle market from the big institutions, which can more efficiently and effectively provide it. Tom Potts, PhD, director of the Financial Services Program at Baylor University in Waco, TX, said that he does not necessarily think financial planning is a calling any more than medicine or law is -- it is how individuals practice it that gives evidence of calling or passion.","Lee, Shelley A",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Feb,2007

It is the source of the word ethics. Ethics is not about standing and reciting a pledge once a year. Ethics is about the habitual, usual, and customary way of treating others. There are some who question whether a financial planner who receives any commissions can ever serve clients as a fiduciary. At its core, the author does not believe that this is as much a legal issue as it is an ethical issue. It is absolutely vital for the ongoing development of financial planning as a profession that clearer light is brought to bear on what the public can actually expect from anyone who holds himself out as a professional financial planner, regardless his or her method of compensation.","Adkins, Rick",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Feb,2007

A financial planning professional is obliged to advise his or her clients from a comprehensive planning perspective. This includes both the exercise of technical competence as well as facilitating the client's quality of life by connecting the plan to what is meaningful, compelling, and significant to them. For transformational change to occur, it must begin from the inside out. More importantly, if they sincerely believe in the value of professional financial advice, they must practice what they preach and secure the services of their own financial planner.

JFP,Long-Term Planning Implications of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005,"The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (TIPRA, signed in May 2006) was a $70 billion tax cut with numerous direct implications for financial planners and their clients. This article highlights several key long-term provisions that will have an impact on financial planning clients in the coming years, and describes the planning implications and opportunities of the provisions. Advance planning will be helpful to take advantage of TIPRA's repeal of the income limit for Roth conversions, although care must be taken when using the new two-year income-averaging provisions applicable in 2010. TIPRA's change of the age limits for the so-called ""kiddie tax"" may shift long-term planning for intra-family wealth among children, in addition to causing additional unintended consequences. 529 plan and Coverdell education savings accounts will likely become more attractive to such affected families.","Kitces, Michael E",1,1,3,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Feb,2007

Purna Pareek, founder and CEO for Advice America, said that integration of data and the problems associated with it is probably one of the most important issues of technology needed in order to increase the adoption rate in all financial planning. Mark Evans, CEO of EISI, believes that financial planning is the tool that can leverage that ability to aggregate the data to really provide value, not only to the client but to the advisor. Greg Friedman, president of Friedman and Associates, thinks that continued flexibility of platforms and the ability to permission and customize the applications will continue to make it easier to use and for advisors to be more productive.","Welsh, Tim",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Feb,2007
JFP,Value Averaging for 401(k) Plans Makes More 'Cents' than Dollar-Cost Averaging,"This study develops a feasible value-averaging strategy for average 401(k) investors by using the equity mutual funds as the driving force and the monthly 401(k) contributions and the bond account as the natural capital reserve. This feasible approach is called 401(k) value averaging. Using monthly historical return data, simulations show that the 401(k) value-averaging strategy generates a higher terminal value for the 401(k) retirement portfolio than traditional dollar-cost averaging. Based on the total risk and risk/reward comparisons such as the Sharpe ratio and the Sortino ratio, it is optimal to follow the 401(k) value-averaging strategy with a target annual growth rate between 8% and 12%.","Chen, Haiwei;Estes, Jim",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Feb,2007

JFP,Bank Loan Funds: Investing Beyond T-Bills,"Some risk-averse investors may want a majority of their wealth in non-equity holdings such as Treasury bills, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds. But returns from these can be anemic. An alternative is an asset class known as bank loans or senior loans. Bank loans are a multi-class hybrid asset. They are the short-term equivalent of high-yield bonds but with important differences. Using standard Markowitz portfolio theory, this article studies the return/risk impact of allocating bank loan funds into a predominately bond portfolio. The study assumes an investor initially invested 100% in T-bills, with bank loan funds and other assets added to the mix for return requirements ranging from 5%-10%. As return requirements rise, bank loan allocations rise, and standard deviations fall, until allocations begin falling significantly above 8% return requirements, giving way to equities. A study of future returns reconfirms the ability of bank loans to deliver returns more than commensurate with their risk.","Chan, Kam C;Trainor, William J, Jr",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Feb,2007

Starting in 2007, employers can automatically enroll their employees in their defined-contribution plans. Another much-anticipated and long-overdue feature of the PPA permits individuals to receive personalized investment advice from plan sponsors, though with a few limitations. The PPA has eliminated the ""temporary"" status of Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s, which will create the largest changes in the retirement system.

JFP,The Upside to Anxiety,"Trend-spotters at the Corporate Executive Board, an advisory resource to large financial institutions, suggest that advisors view retirement as a network of relationships and concerns, not as an event. A growing trend, the triumph of meaning over money, is spurred by the demographic wave. Many planners now accept the idea that to minimize the odds of running out of money before death, a maximum 5% withdrawal rate from a portfolio is de rigueur; that means for every $50,000 a year in post-retirement cash flow desired independent of Social Security or pension income, a portfolio of $1 million is required. As advisors move from a process of needs identification to the deeper realm of needs fulfillment, the role of teacher will add to the value proposition. Long-term health care planning will go beyond the mere placement of an LTC policy. The boomers want to fight age as long as possible. Financial life planning and lifestyle planning go together.","Walker, Lewis",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jan,2007
JFP,Hidden Dragons: Handling Family Conflicts in Buy-Sell Agreements for Business Succession,"Buy-sell agreements are used as the foundation for transferring family-owned businesses across generations. For the process to be successful, relational issues are critical to understand and address. Astute financial advisors will understand that business succession can involve complex family issues and will use a process that addresses these. Two common approaches by advisors can create problems: (1) avoiding the relational issues or (2) trying to resolve all the relational issues present in the family. Rather, the goal is to address only those relational issues intertwined with the business succession plan. The article discusses five common relational traps advisors can be drawn into by family members that will create significant obstacles. These include one family member keeping secrets from another family member, the advisor becoming a messenger between family members (to avoid conflict), or attempting to make everyone feel good and have no negative interactions.","White, Paul E",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jan,2007

JFP,Semivariance in Asset Allocations: Longer Horizons Can Handle Riskier Holdings,"The investment horizon of investors is critical in establishing proper asset allocations. This article uses semivariance and standard deviation as risk measures in determining the historically optimal allocations to a bond index or a small stock-index with a large-stock index over investment horizons of 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. The most surprising finding is that the reward-for-semivariance results consistently indicate a higher allocation to the riskier assets than the reward-for-standard deviation assessments indicate, except for similar allocations by the two metrics for the large stock and corporate bond portfolios at a 20-year horizon. Over longer investment horizons, greater allocations to the riskier asset appear to provide the best return for risk. This result is consistent when using either semivariance or standard deviation as the risk measure. The results support the common advice of greater allocations to riskier assets for long-horizon investing. Long-term asset allocations based on short-term reward-to-risk assessments could lead to an overweighing on low-risk assets and reduce ending portfolio values.","Beach, Steven L",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jan,2007

JFP,Improved Study Finds Index Management Usually Outperforms Active Management,"This study seeks to improve in several ways upon previous studies examining the relative performance of index management versus active management. It concludes that index management outperforms active management in most asset classes. To make comparisons between index management and active management as accurate as possible, the study segregated funds by style and then compared funds of the same style. This ""apples to apples"" comparison is the most accurate methodology. Many studies on indexing versus active management have used only gross returns, which tend to overstate active manager fund performance. By contrast, this study examines fund performance net of management fees, expenses, and the impact of taxes. Also, these studies typically have used commercial mutual fund databases as their investment universe. Unfortunately, all commercial databases suffer from survivor bias, overstating the returns for the universe of active managers that have survived to the present date.

JFP,FAILURE TO LAUNCH: Missed Opportunities in Education Planning,"While 529 plans have been touted as the magic slipper for education woes, experienced education planners argue that a one-size-fits-all product is not necessarily adequate for clients planning for their children's college education -- especially for clients who have left planning to the last minute. Education planning is much more than investment planning. Parents need a financial advisor who understands the landscape of higher education. Few planners will have clients who qualify for need-based financial aid. The secret to all college planning is the use of other people's money. The purpose of college is not to save money but to learn and ultimately to develop a lifelong love of learning. A practice devoted to education planning is ripe for the taking because the financial industry has overlooked education funding for years. The goal for planners should be the ability to approach families facing the high costs of college with the tools to reduce the overall cost of college, thereby creating more funds tot their retirement.","Grote, Jim",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7-Jan,2007

For commission-based financial planners selling cash-value life insurance products, and even for planners helping clients decide whether to buy a cash-value insurance product, the implications are critical. In the first few years of this century, cash value policies faced a perfect storm of competition, a worrisome stock market, and negative publicity. In this information age, cash value life insurance has been forced to become more transparent. Popular finance magazines, newspaper columns, and Web sites have focused on costs and fees associated with cash value life insurance.
